Except thatshe is as attractive and as charming...- As I used to be?- I didn\\'t say that.You\\'re such a flatterer, James.Moneypenny, you know there never hasbeen and never will be anybody but you.So you\\'ve told me.- Welcome to Universal Exports.- Take it, dear.- That\\'s all you\\'ll ever get from him.- Thank you, Commander Bond.- Do you know me?- Miss Moneypenny described you.In nauseating detail.Really?I can see you\\'re goingto fit in here very nicely.- Ah, good morning, 007.- Morning, sir.- Minister.- Commander.I think you know Jim Fanning,our art expert.- Yes. Hello, Jim.- James.- Do you know what this is?- It looks like a Faberg egg, sir.One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Fabergas a gift for the Russian royal family.They\\'re priceless and, uh... And very rare.This one contains a modelof the imperial state coach.- Top marks, 007.- Thank you, sir.Except it\\'s a fake.There\\'s the real thing. It\\'s beingauctioned at Sotheby\\'s this afternoon.This is the fourth eggto turn up at auction this year.It\\'s from none of the usual sources.Anonymous seller,numbered Swiss bank account.I\\'d say that the vendor was a Russian.And now this turns up.A near-perfect forgery.I think Commander Bondshould accompany you to the sale.Splendid!I could use an extra pair of eyes!We could try and spot the seller.They usually turn up out of interestor perhaps just to bump up the price.Thank you, Fanning.Not at all.If it is the Russians,it may be an effort to raise currencyfor covert operations abroador for payoffs.Either way,we\\'d better find out what they\\'re up to.- Yes, Minister.- Eyes only, 007.Operation Trove.You\\'ll be replacing 009.He turned up dead in East Germanywith that egg in his hand.There\\'s not much to go on.Well, we do have one lead, Minister.\"Property of a Lady.\"The next subject on the agendais the continuing mutualdisarmament talks with NATO.I assume you\\'ve all readGeneral Gogol\\'s report.It seems very thorough.Thank you, Comrade Chairman.I believe I express the opinionof everyone presentthat adoption of NATO proposals doesnot compromise our defensive position.Uh, Comrade Chairman!General Orlov.Er, General Gogol is presumptuous.He speaks for himself and otherswho cling to timid, outdatedand unrealistic policies!Must I remind you, the committee,of our overwhelming superiorityover NATO forcesbefore we give it away?In East Germanyunder my direct command,I have 31 divisions,including 11 tank divisionsand another five in Czechoslovakia.In support, on the Russian westernborder are 60 divisions,including 22 tank divisions.In all, a 10-1 advantage.American and West German forcescan field at most ten armoured divisions.The British maintain only a token force.We have played out a variety of attackstrategies on the new Kutuzov computerand find that a lightning thrust byten armoured divisions from the north,and by five morethrough Czechoslovakia,lead to total victory in five daysagainst any possible defence scenario!This is absolute madness!We know where it will end.NATO will counterattackwith nuclear weapons.Never!The West is decadent and divided.It has no stomachto risk our atomic reprisals.Throughout Europe, daily demonstrationsdemand unilateral nuclear disarmament.I see no reason to risk warto satisfy your personal paranoiaand thirst for conquest.We must turn our energiesto pressing domestic problems.- General Gogol, let me remind you...- Comrades, sit down!- I wish to tell you...- Both of you!World socialismwill be achieved peaceably.- Our military role is strictly defensive.- Da.Is that understood, General Orlov?General Gogol, would you continue?Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

Anything more\\'d be crazy....used by Tsar Nicholasin 1897 in Moscow.Property of a Lady.Well, there are quite a few ladies here.She wouldn\\'t have to be here in person.She could be represented by proxy.I\\'ll start it at 150,000.- Any more?- Now there is a lady.220,000!James, stick to the business in hand.260000300,000!And 20?Are you bidding, sir?320,000. New bidder!- That\\'s interesting.- You know him?- Mm. Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.- 340,000. 360.Marginal quality from dubious sources.380000- 400 in the centre.- Well, that should do it.- Kamal has gone over the top.- Your bid, sir. 400,000.- 425! New bidder.Thank you, sir.- 425!- Have you gone mad?Let\\'s see how badly he wants it.The bid is 450. 475?Against you, sir.

All done?Any more?Yours, sir, for 500,000!- The next lot is...- We could have been stuck with it.- I doubt it. He had to buy it.- But why?That\\'s what I intend to find out.You had no business bidding for that egg!What would you have done if you\\'d got it?I would have claimed it was a fake, sir,and not paid.Not paid?Here\\'s the original. I switched itwith the fake during the auction.Good God!And what happenswhen the buyer discovers that?Well, he... He complains.If he\\'s legitimate.- Well?- I don\\'t think he will complain.According to Fanning,this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.I believe that the fake will smoke him out.Our tail followed him to Heathrowwhere he got a plane to Delhi.Hm. You must go there, too.I\\'ll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I,to keep him under surveillance.- Book yourself on the next flight out.- Well, I\\'ve 55 minutes to catch it, sir.- Oh, Bond?- Sir?Sign a chit for that egg before you go.It\\'s government property now.Of course, sir.That\\'s a charming tune.You do take English money?Only gold sovereigns.Please.I\\'m Vijay.Special expediter, Universal Exports.- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.- Call me James.- Where\\'s Sadruddin?- Over here, waiting in the taxi.This was the wrong cover.

Shall we double?Of course!- Always a double six when you need it!- Always.- How do you do it!- It\\'s all in the wrist.- Oh, it\\'s hopeless.- Shall we have another game, Major?- Same stake?- Yes, I\\'ll have another go.Your luck\\'s got to run out some time.May I join you?Sotheby\\'s. Half a million pounds?- The man at the auction.- Precisely.You have a good memory for faces.And figures.- This can\\'t be a coincidence.- No.- What will you have?- Nothing, thank you.Some other time, perhaps?Thank you.Six and one!- Well?- Looks like the Major has got him.Why don\\'t we make it interesting, Major?Double to 100,000 rupees.I can\\'t accept. Not with your luck.You win!I would havetaken that double, myself.Then why don\\'t you take overthe Major\\'s position? Mr...?Bond.James Bond. Thank you, I\\'d be delighted.Double six.Not such a good doubleto accept, after all, was it?- Double.- Of course!You can only win with a double six.The stake is 200,000 rupees.Do you have the cash?Well, I think that thisshould be ample security.- Don\\'t you?Play, Mr Bond.You need a great deal of luckto get out of this.Oh, luck?Well, then I shall use player\\'s privilege,and use your lucky dice.It\\'s all in the wrist.Double sixes.Fancy that!I prefer cash.- Get it cashed for him.- Yes, sir.Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.I intend to, Kamal Khan.My security.And yours?It\\'s not really in the wrist, you know.- Should I be following them?- Yes, but I think they\\'ll be following this.Thank you.Vijay will take you from here.I\\'ll see if I can find out more about Kamal.Good. Hold on to these, will you?Keep you in curryfor a few weeks, won\\'t it?Thank you.It\\'s a wonderful racket, this.- Vijay, we have company!- No problem. This is a company car.Step on it!This should shake \\'em off!Oh. Thank God for hard currency!Game, set and match! Hang on, James!Keep your head down!Thank you.Ow! Ooh, ooh, ooh!Here! Catch!Excuse me.Thank you.You\\'d better stick this back yourself.James, over here! Come on!Vijay! The money I gave you!Here! Rupees!Easy come, easy go!Hm. It certainly pays to advertise.This way, James.Ah, Q!- How are you?- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.How can I be expectedto maintain the quality of my work?Sent out here at a moment\\'s notice!Have you any smaller thread?Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.Ah, they missed you?

I\\'ve got my work to do.- I\\'ll give you a hand, Q.- Thank you.Don\\'t forget this.Don\\'t let him teach youany of his bad habits!Mr Bond, your table is ready.- I didn\\'t reserve one.- Your guest is waiting, sir.This way, please.Thank you.You changed your mind.- I\\'m glad.- Are you?Well, let\\'s put it this way.You are the least lethal andby far the prettiest of Kamal\\'s friendsthat I\\'ve come across.Thank you.So does he have a proposition for me,or do you?He suggests a trade.The egg for your life.I\\'d heard the price of eggs was going up,but isn\\'t that a little high?Charge it to, er... Room...Oh, 27.Along with the champagne, I suppose?I\\'ll leave it at the desk.You don\\'t mind?Why?

Out! In! Out!In! Out!Come on, girls! In!Out!Check oars!The egg has been recovered.You should be pleased.I\\'m not pleasedit was stolen in the first place.Nor that the thiefknows enough to bring it here.He\\'s obviously an adventurerwith possible blackmail on his mind.Anyway, I have him as my guestat the Monsoon Palace.And he will tell usall he knows very quickly.- Who is he?- Englishman.Likes eggs. Preferably Faberg.And dice. Preferably loaded.His name is James Bond.Bring him here.He\\'s dangerous. After he\\'s talked,we must get rid of him immediately.No.A \"no\" from youhas little chance of becoming a \"yes\".I assume, therefore,that the meeting is over.But you\\'re making a serious mistake.Well, so far I can\\'t complainabout the valet service.Dinner. 8 o\\'clock.- Good evening, Mr Bond.- Good evening.Well rested?I believe you and Miss Magda have met.- It was a pleasure.- You\\'re too kind.You don\\'t mind if we start?The souffl can\\'t wait.At the risk of appearingto be making light dinner conversation,may I ask exactly why I am here?I mean, after all, you do have the egg.True. But we don\\'t have all the answers.Well, supposing, for argument\\'s sake,I don\\'t feel like talking?Don\\'t worry, you will.You will.Let me guess.Thumbscrews and hot coals.Hardly! We\\'re much moresophisticated than that.- Er... Sodium Pentothal?- A bit crude. Very unreliable.We prefer curare withan effective psychedelic compound.Guaranteed results.- But with permanent brain damage.- An unfortunate side effect.Ah! One of our specialities.Stuffed sheep\\'s head.It\\'s odd,but when I\\'m stared atI seem to lose my appetite.Oh, thank you for dinner.Until tomorrow, then.- Well, I\\'ll say good night.- I could come in for a nightcap.Some other time, perhaps.I don\\'t suppose you\\'d care for a nightcap?No.I trust you had a pleasant flight.If you step this way,I think you will find everything is in order.I congratulate you on the quality ofyour workmanship, Prince Kamal Khan.Thank you, General Orlov.As you can see, each piecehas been meticulously duplicatedaccording to Lenkin\\'s specifications.Good! Have it put aboard the helicopter.Can they be trusted?I assure you of their silence.We are both playingfor enormous stakes.I get what I want,then you get the genuine jewellery.- Exactly...The precise timing will be essential.Remember: Nothing must be changed.One week from today,in Karl-Marx-Stadt.- Karl-Marx-Stadt!- Correct!- Everything taken care of?- As you ordered, Excellence.- So, you recovered it?- From an accomplice of the thief.He must be eliminated at once!There must be no further security breach.This fake has caused enough trouble.I must go.Everythinghas been most satisfactory.Most kind, General Orlov.Get Bond!The Englishman has escaped.He won\\'t go very far. We\\'ll track him.Ooh!Oooh! Ya-ha!Good!Let the sport commence.Ooh! Agh! Yieeehhh!Head him off! Head him off!Sit!We have him! We have him!Go round! Go round! He\\'s in there!Hiss off.Ow!Ugh!Don\\'t let him get away!Hey!- C\\'mom, buddy, c\\'mon!- Give him some room.- Hey, you all right, buddy?- I\\'m fine.- Are you with our group?- No, ma\\'am. I\\'m with the economy tour.Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.Soon to be made extinct!Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venomthat\\'s invariably fatal in seconds.The barge had that sign.Yes. It belongs to a fabulously wealthywoman who lives on the floating palace.Who is she?No one knows her real name,but she\\'s known as Octopussy.That\\'s the name I heard at Kamal\\'s.I hear that island\\'s full ofbeautiful women. No men allowed.Really? Sexual discrimination.I\\'ll definitely have to pay it a visit.Good evening.I wondered when you might arrive.So you are the mysterious Octopussy.And you are James Bond.Am I to be your target for tonight?Not necessarily.Depends how much you tell meabout jewellery smuggling.And why one of our agentswas killed in East Berlin.I know nothing about that.You remember Major Dexter Smythe?You were sent out to arrest him,weren\\'t you?You seem to have done your homework.Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliantmilitary career, joined our secret service.His mission was to recover a cacheof Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.Both he and his native guide disappeared.The gold was never found.And 20 years lateryou were sent after him.The guide\\'s body turned up with a bulletstill in his skull from Smythe\\'s revolver.I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,and gave him 24 hours to clear uphis affairs before I took him back.He committed suicide rather thanface the disgrace of a court martial.What\\'s the connection?He was my father. I\\'d hopedfate would bring us together one day.To avenge him?No. To thank youfor giving him an alternative.Come in.Kamal Khan to see you.Bond has escaped.- How careless of you!- I apologise.By the way, I\\'d like youto meet my new house guest.Er, an old friend of the family,you might say.How lovely.You have a nasty habit of surviving.You know what they say about the fittest.Octopussy, I would enjoy anotheropportunity to take care of Mr Bond- personally.- I will take care of Mr Bond myself.Good night.And enjoy yourselves.Mr Bond.My father becamea leading authority on octopi.He loved them.His pet name for me was Octopussy.Mr Bond, smuggling is no concernof the secret service.I\\'ve violated no British law.You are free to leave, but I\\'d much preferif you stayed as my guest for a few days.I\\'d like that.Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.Good night, Mr Bond.Till the morning, then.Midge.Extend Mr Bond every courtesy,but double the guard on his quarters.He says the island is heavily guarded.We don\\'t want tomake enemies with the woman.The woman must not be harmed.When Father\\'s gold ran out, the people inHong Kong who\\'d disposed of it for himoffered me a commissionto smuggle some diamonds.I discovered I had a talent for it.So you went into business yourself?Yes, but I needed an organisation,so I revived the old Octopus cult.Well, then.Where did you recruit all these lovelies?There are many of themall over Southeast Asia,looking for a guru,spiritual discipline, who knows what.I train them. Give them a purpose,a sisterhood and a way of life.- In crime?- In business.I have diversified intoshipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.- Is he still there?- You must be joking!populated exclusively by women?We won\\'t see him till dawn.- I\\'ll relieve you at midnight.- No problem!Are we going somewhere?I have to go to Europe tomorrowon a business trip.Oh, that\\'s a pity.I was just beginning to enjoy myself.I think you should stay.I\\'ll only be gone a week.When I come backwe\\'ll discuss the future.Well, I can\\'t guaranteethat I\\'ll be here when you return.Oh, James! We\\'re two of a kind.There are vast rewards for a manof your talents willing to take risks.- I\\'m not for hire.- Oh!

Do you knowhow hard it is to obtain this equipment?I mean, this is the latestUS and European stuff.I\\'ve made commitments,letters of credit, special payoffs.We know you\\'ve had our moneyin your Swiss account for eight weeks,and that you have madeno payments of any kind.I can\\'t cancel orders at this late date.As one soldier to another,you have my word of honor...Spare me your military pretensions.What army did you serve in?You were expelledfrom West Point for cheating.Then a short stint asa mercenary in the Belgian Congo.Later you worked with various criminalsthat helped finance your first arms deals.Lies spread by my competitors.You seem to forget your \"wars of liberation\"that I have supplied through General Koskov.Those are my business credentials.The money in two days, or you\\'ll findyourself out of business permanently.Georgi Koskov as well.I don\\'t know what you two are scheming,but it is over.

Who will pay?Georgi, of course.Mm...Please. Stop it.The chief wants you.We have to report.Very good.At ease, Sergeant.Pushkin wants the money back.Don\\'t worry. We\\'ve convincedthe British that Pushkin is a danger.They will send their best man,James Bond, to eliminate him.I\\'m not convinced. Necros can do it.I\\'ve worked with the Russians.My appearance is well known to them.It could jeopardize my comradeswho depend upon me.And they depend upon me. Where elsewill they find a steady supply of arms?Our basic plan is sound.Pushkin is, how you say, history.Not yet. Your James Bondhasn\\'t laid a finger on him.The British are naturally cautious.An additional inducement will ensure this.For instance,if another agent were... eliminated.Do it. But if Pushkin is still alive onthe last day of the conference, kill him.(# \"Marriage of Figaro\" by Mozart)- All my life I\\'ve dreamt of this.- Maybe you\\'ll play here one day.That\\'s too much to hope for.Excuse me for a few moments.- Isn\\'t that...?- The cello girl.- The KGB sniper?

She\\'s Koskov\\'s girlfriend.She shot blanks at himto make his defection look real to us.Koskov\\'s defection phony?The KGB snatched him back.That\\'s what we were supposed to think.These are serious accusations, Bond.What are you up to?I\\'m posing as Koskov\\'s friendto see what leads I can get from her.You know he bought her a celloin New York called the Lady Rose?- A cello with a name?- It\\'s a Stradivarius. They all have names.Where would Koskov getthat kind of money? Check it out.I\\'ll need papers for her tonight. I haveto get her out of the country by tomorrow.Here... I took these this afternoon.Look, this is highly irregular. I won\\'tget the OK from London for a day at least.It can\\'t wait, Saunders.That girl\\'s our only chanceof getting Koskov back.(bell rings)Very well.I\\'ve got nothing to lose but my pension.Meet me at the Prater Cafnear the Ferris wheel at midnight.(orchestra tunes up)(screaming)- No more.- This one.(mechanized scream/laughter)Take me on the wheel.You\\'ll be able to see better.- Ballon, mein Herr?- Nein.Is it real or just a dream?- (thud)- What\\'s wrong?

Make yourself comfortable.That\\'s good. Right on over there.Good evening, Mr Bond.Blofeld.Good evening, 007.Double jeopardy, Mr Bond.You killed my only other double,|I\\'m afraid.After his death, volunteers were|- understandably - rather scarce.Such a pity. All that time and expensesimply to provide you|with one mock-heroic moment.Willard Whyte speakin\\'.Yes, Governor. I got your message.No, I\\'m afraid a personal appearance|is quite out of the question.I\\'ll send a deposition to the committee.Thank you, Governor.Well, that\\'s a neat trick.A voice box, Mr Bond.Science was never my strong suit,but the principle is easy enough.Someone\\'s voice patterns and resonancestored in a small oral-signature tape.And a miniature, transistorised version|is installed in his neck.Or is it \"his\" neck? I never can remember.Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.My congratulations to you both.Nice little company.Explosives, oil, electronics,|houses, aviation.I\\'ve done rather well with it, too.Tried to cut some of the fat off,|but Mr Whyte\\'s a splendid administrator.Damn thing runs itself.I suppose you killed \"him\".Nothing so melodramatic.I\\'m simply holding him|in cold storage, so to speak.An insurance policy against any|outside interference with my plans.The ideal kidnap victim.|No one\\'s seen the man for five years.Who\\'d miss someone|who\\'s already missing?How clever you are, Mr Bond.Nice to see you haven\\'t lost|that fine mental edge, 007.Please don\\'t get any foolish notions.That missile is not a practical weapon.Well, it\\'s hardly worth the effort.After all, I wouldn\\'t know|which one of you to kill.We appreciate|your predicament, Mr Bond.We deeply sympathise.Right idea, Mr Bond.But wrong pussy.I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr Bond.However potentially painful they may be.But I\\'m afraid this one|has come to an end.What do you intend to do|with those diamonds?An excellent question.And one which will be hanging|on the lips of the world quite soon.If I were to break the news to anyone,it would be to you first. You know that.But it\\'s late, I\\'m tired,and there\\'s so much left to do.Good night, Mr Bond.Well, go on, go on. It\\'s merely a lift.Or perhaps I should say \"elevator\".In any event, I\\'m sure|you\\'ll find it much more convenientthan mountaineering about|outside the Whyte House.You press L, Mr Bond.The word \"lobby\" begins with L.If at first you don\\'t succeed, Mr Kidd...Try, try again, Mr Wint.One of us smells like|a tart\\'s handkerchief.I\\'m afraid it\\'s me.|Sorry about that, old boy.I don\\'t mind the cockamamie machine|breaking down twice a day.But why the hell does it always have to be|500 yards away from the nearest hatch?All right, Charlie.|It\\'s your turn to play hunchback.Thank you very much.I was just out walking my rat|and I seem to have lost my way.Willard Whyte speakin\\'.This is Bert.We got a problem.Got a cold?Never mind about that.I just saw James Bond in the casino.- Come and see for yourself.Hey, listen.If he\\'s half the genius they say he is,|we\\'re in for real trouble.- Calm down, Bert.|-\\xa0It\\'s a cinch he\\'s not working alone.This place must be|crawling with agents by now.- Nonsense.at his own summerhouse.It\\'s on the ridge,|about ten miles out of town.It\\'s not like you to panic.I just don\\'t enjoy messing around|with a guy as tough as James Bond.Never mind James Bond.|You get down to that house.I\\'m afraid Mr Whyte has suddenly|outgrown his usefulness.Do it cleanly, Bert.Don\\'t worry. Just leave everything to me.That ridiculous contraption|actually seems to work, Q.You\\'ve surpassed yourself this time.Not a bit of it. Made one of these|for the kids last Christmas.Maxwell, James and I|will head for the house.Get set to hit the penthouse|as soon as we find Whyte.Let me speak to Metz.There\\'s been a change.|Push all plans forward by 24 hours.I\\'m joining you immediately.Give me five minutes to get up there|and five minutes to find Whyte.Are you sure you know|what you\\'re doing?Ask me again in ten minutes\\' time.Tell Maxwell to stand by|to hit the penthouse.Well, hi there!I\\'m Bambi.Good morning... Bambi.And I\\'m Thumper.Is there something we can do for you?I can think of several things offhand butat the moment|I\\'m looking for Willard Whyte.Oh, Willie.Why, he\\'s right out there.And that\\'s all there is to it?Not quite.First... we\\'re gonna have a ball.All yours, Bambi!You\\'re on again, Bambi!Thumper...Hello, Felix.Willard Whyte is about to be executed,and guess who\\'s giving|breaststroke lessons.Where The hell is Whyte?I  haven\\'t found out yet. Still haven\\'t found out.Right!FBI?CIA?No.British Intelligence, Mr Whyte.|James Bond.I see you\\'ve met my friends,|Bambi and Thumper.Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.What the hell\\'s happened to me|and what can I do about it?Let\\'s get out of here first|and I\\'ll explain it to you en route.Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse...Saxby.- Bert Saxby?!Yeah.Tell him he\\'s fired.Hi there, Mr Q. Are you having any luck?I\\'m being somewhat successful,|thank you.Listen, Mr Q. I... I was wondering.Have you heard any talk about mefrom Felix or James?No, I\\'m afraid not.I guess I\\'m working|for the good guys now,but I\\'m two steps away from|the slammer if they want me there.I thought... you might be able|to put in a good word.That\\'s unbelievable!An electromagnetic RPM controller.Been aching to give it a try. You see,pressure on the case when|the desired symbols appearcauses the rotation of the cylinders to|stutter at the precise moment needed to...Cab, lady?Well, well, well.|Look what the cat dragged in.I\\'m delighted to meet you, Miss Case.I\\'d so dreaded the prospect of|making this tedious journey alone.This way, Mr Whyte.It was right here.About six feet high, with a solar panel.- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...|-\\xa0Draw it for me.Was Dr Metz on your payroll, Mr Whyte?No. But I heard of him.|Everybody in our business has.The world\\'s leading expert|on laser refraction.A committed idealist to peace.And how in the hell Blofeld got|his hooks in him, I will never know!How did he get security clearance|to work here in the first place?From you, sir. I talked|to you personally about it.I even recognised your voice just now.I\\'m sure I must\\'ve told younot to keep the usual duplicate|microfilm records of the project.Exactly, sir.Tom, what did \"I\" tell you to do with this?Send it to Vandenberg, sir.Well, get \\'em on the phone - now!Yeah?You won\\'t believe this.- Willard Whyte for you!|-\\xa0Wow.- This is a real honour, sir.|-\\xa0Shove your honour!- Where\\'s that satellite I sent down there?|-\\xa0Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.Perfect trajectory. All systems go.|We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.Just a moment.- Wait. Something\\'s happened.|-\\xa0The scanners have gone crazy.- Premature first-stage separation!|- It doesn\\'t make sense!Stand by to abort!We can\\'t control it, sir.Abort it!It\\'s negative.We can\\'t. Something\\'s taken over|the guidance system!It\\'s as if it had a will of its own.And there\\'s not a damn thing|we can do about it.We\\'re working on it.|I\\'ll call you back, Mr Whyte.Whatever it is,|your friend Blofeld\\'s controllin\\' it now.A vast supply of diamonds manipulated|by an expert in light refraction.The first laser beam|was generated through a diamond.And if old Metz deserves his reputation,the power of that thing|could be incredible.And Blofeld\\'s got it.- Approaching North Dakota.Alert Strategic Air Command.Gimme an open line to SAC.Attention all personnel.for emergency procedure.Willard Whyte.Yes, General.One of our missiles just \"accidentally\"|blew up in North Dakota.Whatever\\'s happenin\\',|Mr Bond, has started.- Is this your herd?|-\\xa0Mr Whyte, phone call from Washington.Urgent.I\\'ll catch it in the john.- What about Blofeld?|-\\xa0Not a trace.We found a tunnel. We\\'ll check it out.- Where\\'s Tiffany?|-\\xa0Do you \"mind\" if we find Blofeld first?Come on! Let\\'s hit that tunnel!Washington just got word|from your friend with the cat.Would you believe that this whole|damn country is bein\\' held for ransomand we\\'ve got|till noon tomorrow to pay up?So that\\'s it. Well, I\\'m sure|you won\\'t be alone.An international auction,with nuclear supremacy|goin\\' to the highest bidder.Tell me, what does he need|to control that satellite?A simple set of tapes|fed into a computer bank.All he really needs is a building.And these tapes? Large or small?Conceivably any size.From six inches to a cassette.Assuming he\\'s still using|your empire as a cover,Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.From Alaska to Florida.From Maine to Oregon.From Texas to... Baja California.Baja?!I haven\\'t got anything in Baja!There is still no official explanationin North Dakota and Russia.refused comment on a reportthe Joint Chiefs of Staff is in session.the Soviet Union have assured each otherhas been taken by either nation.in Red China are as yet unconfirmed.Two more submarines have taken up|position not ten miles away.Are those military aircraft|going to stand off forever?What if they won\\'t accept our ultimatum?|What if they attack?Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical|show of force was only to be expected.The Great Powers|flexing their military muscleslike so many impotent beach boys.I deeply regret my threat to destroy|a major city unless they give in,but the nuclear powers, like all bullies,|can only be intimidated by force.- But how can you...|-\\xa0They still have an hour left to reply.One hour for both of us to achieve|our common dream: Total disarmamentand peace for the world.- Sir, there\\'s a single plane approaching.Range?Two miles, and closing.Stage One alert, please.Command Centre.All crew to Stage One.Up the top! Second platform!There he is! Aim!Hold your fire!proceed to docking level and stand by.Good morning, gentlemen!|The Acme Pollution Inspection.We\\'re cleaning up the world. We thought|this was a suitable starting point.How disappointing! I expected|one head of state, at the very least.Surely you haven\\'t come|to negotiate, Mr Bond?Your pitiful little island|hasn\\'t even been threatened.Search him from his toenails to the last|follicle on his head. Then bring him to me.I do so hate martial music.As usual, Mr Bond,|you were absolutely right.You guessed correctly that that box|contained the satellite control tapeand you came aboard presumably|hoping to substitute thisfor the real thing.So sorry to have ruined|the line of your suit for nothing.Talking about lines,|which one did you use on Miss Case?She has taken a reasonable attitude.Like any sensible animal,|she\\'s only threatening when threatened.Well, it appears that|you\\'re holding all the aces.- Right down to the dragon lady here.|-\\xa0Jealousy? From you, Mr Bond? I\\'m flattered.As La Rochefoucauld observed:\"Humility is the worst form of conceit.\"I do hold the winning hand.Why don\\'t you let me take you|on a little tour of our facilities?Your chance to see|the real tape once again.Can I tag along, Ernst?I\\'d put something on|over that bikini first, my dear.I\\'ve come too far|to have the aim of my crewaffected by the sight of a pretty body.No word yet from anyone!Only 12 minutes left.I suppose a little gentle prodding|is called for.As you see, Mr Bond,|the satellite is at present overKansas.If we destroy Kansas, the world|may not hear about it for years.Perhaps New York.|All that smut and traffic.It would give them a chance|for a fresh start.Washington, DC. Perfect.Since we have not heard from \"them\",|\"they\" will hear from \"us\".- See to it, Metz.|-\\xa0Washington. Right.And this, presumably,|is the control bank with the coded tape.Right again, Mr Bond.All satellites are controlled|by a coded tape.The trick is, of course, to have the code.Obviously.It all seems so perfectly simple. I suppose|one just presses that and out it pops.Put it back, Mr Bond.Immediately.Hi, Ernst.Is Superman giving you any trouble?Put it back... very carefully.You\\'ve suddenly|become tiresome, Mr Bond.Target fixed! Commence countdown!Ten minutes and counting!Take him away and throw him in the brig.And search him again, just to make sure.Bitch!Come on!Your problems are all behind you now.Stop him!Nine minutes and counting.I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.You stupid twit. You put|the real one back in.Come on, let\\'s go!A weather balloon!- What do you think, Mr Leiter?|-\\xa0That must be the signal. There isn\\'t a low-pressure area|within 200 miles of here. Let\\'s go!This is Charlie One to Squadron.Ready all guns and proceed to target.I repeat: Proceed to target.Roger, Charlie One.

Seven minutes and counting.This is Charlie One.Commence attack!Commence attack!Six minutes and counting.Get them on the radio, Blofeld!- Tell them we give up!|-\\xa0Give up? I\\'ve waited too long for this moment.They\\'ll pay dearly|for making a fool out of me.I see it all now.|You don\\'t give a damn about peace!- All you care about...|-\\xa0Shut up, Metz.Tiffany, my dear.We\\'re showing a bit more \"cheek\"|than usual, aren\\'t we?Take her below and|lock her up with Mr Bond.What a pity.

Le Chiffredoesnt have 100 million to lose.Has he been playing the stock marketwith his clients funds?Theyre not gonna be too happywhen they find out its gone.We cant let him win this game.If he loses,hell have nowhere to run.Well give him sanctuaryin return for everything he knows.Im putting you in the gamereplacing someonewhos playing for a syndicate.According to Villiers,youre the best player in the Service.Trust me, I wish it wasnt the case.I would ask you if you could remainemotionally detachedbut I dont thinkthats your problem, is it, Bond?No.Dont worry about keeping in touch.Well know where you are.You can stop pretending.You knew I wouldnt let this drop,didnt you?Well, I knew you were you.Thank you.Im the money.Every penny of it.The Treasury has agreedto stake you in the game.Vesper.Well, I do hope you gaveyour parents hell for that.Thank you.Your boss must be well-connected.Ive never seen so muchgo out the door so quickly.Or quite so stylishly.May I ask you where it is?Ten million was wiredto your account in Montenegrowith a contingency for 5 moreif I deem it a prudent investment.I suppose youve given some thoughtto the notion that if you loseour governmentwill have directly financed terrorism.What looks good?So youre telling me its a matterof probability and odds.I was worried there wassome chance involved.Well, only if you assume the playerwith the best hand wins.So that would bewhat you call bluffing?Youve heard the term.Then youll also know that in pokeryou never play your hand.You play the man across from you.-And youre good at reading people?-Yes, I am.Which is whyIve been able to detectan undercurrentof sarcasm in your voice.Im now assured our moneyis in good hands.You dont thinkthis is a very good plan, do you?So there is a plan?I got the impressionwe were risking millions of dollarsand hundreds of liveson a game of luck.What else can you surmise,Mr. Bond?About you, Miss Lynd?Well, your beautys a problem.You worry you wontbe taken seriously.Which one can say of anyattractive woman with half a brain.True, but this oneovercompensatesby wearingslightly masculine clothingbeing more aggressivethan her female colleagueswhich gives her a somewhatprickly demeanorand ironically enough, makes itless likely for her to be acceptedand promotedby her male superiorswho mistake her insecuritiesfor arrogance.Now, Id have normallygone with only childbut, you see, by the way you ignoredthe quip about your parentsIm gonna have to go with orphan.All right.By the cut of your suit,you went to Oxford or whereverand actually thinkhuman beings dress like that.But you wear it with such disdainmy guess isyou didnt come from moneyand your school friendsnever let you forget it.Which means you wereat that school by the graceof someone elses charity,hence the chip on your shoulder.And since your first thought about meran to orphanthats what Id say you are.Oh, you are.I like this poker thing.And that makes perfect sensesince MI6 looksfor maladjusted young menthat give little thoughtto sacrificing othersin order to protectQueen and country.You knowformer SAS types with easy smilesand expensive watches.-Rolex?-Omega.Beautiful.Now, having just met youI wouldnt go as far as calling youa cold-hearted bastard.No, of course not.But it wouldnt be a stretchto imagine.You think of womenas disposable pleasuresrather than meaningful pursuits.So as charming as you are,Mr. BondI will be keeping my eyeon our governments moneyand off your perfectly formed arse.You noticed?Even accountants have imagination.How was your lamb?Skewered.One sympathizes.Good evening, Mr. Bond.Good evening, Miss Lynd.-Hotel Splendid, sir?-Thats right.-Thank you, sir.-Thank you.Its just last-minute details.Apparently were very much in love.Do you usually leave it to portersto tell you this sort of thing?Only when the romancehas been necessarily brief.Im Mr. Arlington Beech,professional gamblerand youreMiss Stephanie Broadchest-I am not.-Youre gonna have to trust me on this.Oh, no, I dont.Weve been involvedfor quite a whilehence the shared suite.But my familyis strict Roman Catholicso for appearances sake,itll be a two-bedroom suite.I do hate it when religioncomes between us.Religion and a securely locked door.Am I going to have a problemwith you, Bond?No, dont worry.

Thank you.Presidential authority is confirmedfor change of test procedure.Dummy warheads will be replacedby W80 thermonuclear device.Have a nice day.Jack!Bravo!Oh, no! No!Oh!My poor angel. My sweet baby.Mr. Kovacs, how much longer?They\\'re coming. They\\'re almost in range.Range safety officer to base. Alert.Radar confirms both missileson descent trajectory. Repeat.What the hell\\'s going on here?They\\'ve got maximum thrust,but they\\'re still going down.About to cross minimum cruise height.Descending below minimum cruise height.Damn! We\\'ve lost them.We\\'ve got them.Well, Kovacs?The fish are netted.Put them on ice.I am supreme commander of SPECTRE,the Special Executivefor Counterintelligence,Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.Yesterday morning,the American Air Forcelaunched two cruise missilesfrom Swadley airbase in Great Britain.Through the ingenuity of SPECTRE,the dummy warheads they carriedwere replaced with live nuclear warheads.Your weapons of destruction arenow safely in our possessionand will be moved to two secret targets.Please note the serialnumbers of the missiles.They will confirm the truth.Your weapons of deterrence didnot deter us from our objective.A terrible catastrophe now confronts you.However, it can be avoided by payinga tribute to our organization,amounting to 25o/o of your respectivecountries\\' annual oil purchases.We have accomplished two of the functionsthat the name SPECTRE embodies,terror and extortion.If our demands are notmet within seven days,we shall ruthlessly applythe third, revenge.That would be $25 billion a year!Order, gentlemen, please. Order!These demands would destabilizethe monetary system!I call this meeting to order!The foreign secretary wishes to address you!Lord Ambrose.Gentlemen, we are faced withthe ultimate nightmare,the abduction of nuclear warheads.But how is this possible?Up to this point, our fail-safeprocedures relating to nuclear hardwarehave been absolutely foolproof.I hope the American government realizesits awesome responsibility in this matter.NATO has a joint responsibilityto solve this problem, gentlemen.But if this gets out, itwill cause worldwide panic.How well has thisinformation been contained?Apart from those present in this room,the information resides only withthe CIA and British Intelligence.Wonderful. That means by nowit\\'s all over the Kremlin.I know your feelings, M, but I insistyou reactivate the double-0\\'s.As you wish, sir.Maximilian Largo, born Bucharest, 1945.Industrialist and philanthropist.Resident Nassau, Bahamas. Noknown criminal activities...Here you are.You still here, Moneypenny?You should be in bed.James, we both should be.Instead I\\'m looking everywhere for you.Forget that.M wants to see you right now.It\\'s panic stations upstairs.He\\'s been with the Prime Minister all day.I think you\\'re back in business, James.Welcome home.Good morning, gentlemen.Morning. Morning.- The latest reports?- Everything okay?Yes, sir.Good morning.Good morning, Charles.In absolute secrecy, the Americansare trying to trace the missilethat\\'s on their eastern seaboard.The other allegedly threatens theoilfields of the Middle East.How well protected are they from the air?Everyone\\'s collaborating. TheAmericans, NATO, the Japanese.They\\'re putting up an air screena mosquito couldn\\'t get through.Our concern is that the warheadmay already be in position.The worst devastation would resultfrom a subterranean explosion.You see, the oil-bearingstrata in the area,interconnected by a surprisinglydelicate structure...It would be a sort of ripple effect.What\\'s the Americans\\' story onhow the damn things were stolen?The release of ALCMs has to comefrom the President himself.Even that has safeguards.It can only be authorized aftera scan of his right eye.The only irregularity they\\'ve discoveredis that a communications officerunofficially left the baseat the time of the launch.A certain Captain Jack Petachi.If this Petachi was involved,is it conceivable that hecould have used a false eye?Do come along, Bond.Let\\'s think of a more logicalexplanation, shall we?Okay, let\\'s run through that routinewe were working on yesterday...It\\'ll make you strong.There.Let\\'s go again.Okay.Four, five, six, seven, down.Come on, now.Max!As usual, I have left youalone too long. I know.But I brought you a gift.I don\\'t want any more gifts.I just want you. That\\'s all I want.I know, but this is different.Look. Max.Look.What is it?It\\'s very old.What\\'s the inscription?Arabic. The Tears of Allah.The story is that the Prophet weptfor the barrenness of the desert,and his tears made a well.It\\'s a legend, of course,but like all great legends,it is also the truth.It is the most valuable thingI have ever possessed. Except you.And you trust me to wear it?A safer place than around yourneck, I couldn\\'t imagine.And what if I ever leave you?No, really!Then I cut your throat.Nice to know even old Q can surpriseone of you double-0\\'s occasionally.Algernon.Not quite perfected yet.You could write a verybinding contract with this.Yeah, I wish I had a new contract.They\\'ve slashed my budget, you see.You can\\'t get the spare parts.And when you can, there\\'s usuallysome strike that stops delivery.And look at this place. They keepit bloody freezing down here.Plays havoc with my sinuses.We\\'re both humble servantsof the Crown, Algy.If the CIA made me an offer,I\\'d be off like a shot.Unlimited resources, air conditioning,28 flavors of ice cream in the restaurant.It\\'s a motorbike toy.If I can get the thing to workproperly, I\\'ll ship it out to you.Wait a minute. I\\'ve got somethingin here that could be useful.The prototype came from a KGB defector.Bit of a whiz kid intheir technical section.Not a bad chap, though like alldefectors, prone to melancholy.I suppose it\\'s all thatvodka and English weather.Rather tasty, this is. It looks likea watch, but it\\'s really a laser.Keeps perfect time.But for how long?At least your lifetime.Good to see you, Mr. Bond.Things have been awfully dull round here.Bureaucrats running the old place,everything done by the book.Can\\'t make a decision unless thecomputer gives you the go-ahead.Now you\\'re on this,I hope we\\'re going to have somegratuitous sex and violence.I certainly hope so, too. What is this for?I\\'ll show you.You unscrew it, then stick it up your nose.It\\'s for my sinus.Well, I won\\'t need one ofthese where I\\'m going.Where\\'s that?Or are you not allowed to say?The Bahamas.Lucky bloody you!Sorry.That\\'s perfectly all right.What are you hoping to catch?Something about 6\\'2\", 190pounds, with brown eyes.Well, why bother going to sea?Let me help you.Mr. Bond!I say, Mr. Bond!Catch you later, perhaps.Right.Nigel Small-Fawcett,British embassy, Nassau.How do you do, Nigel?Sorry I\\'m late.But as you\\'re one of theseundercover johnnies,I took the precautionof not being followed.And that\\'s why you shoutedmy name across the harbor?Oh, God, did I? I\\'m sorry.Damn. Damn!Sorry. I\\'m rather new to all this.What\\'s the score with Largo?He\\'s highly visible in these parts.Enormously wealthy. Owns thebiggest boat in the Caribbean.Spends a lot of his time at aplace called Bluebeard Reef.Marine archeology, I gather.You\\'ve met him?Oh, yes. He\\'s charming.I mean, foreign, but charming nonetheless.He donates a lot of money to worthy causes.He built a maritime museum anda new wing for the orphanage.I\\'m sure he\\'s very kind to his mother.Don\\'t know his mother.You\\'re not going to make anytrouble, are you, Mr. Bond?Let\\'s face it, yourreputation has preceded you.Do I look like the sort ofman who would make trouble?Well, yes, frankly.And you\\'re going tojeopardize the tourist tradeif you start going around killing people.Nigel, please. Just go back to your desk.Find out where Largo\\'sboat is at the moment.Call me later. I\\'ll be at my hotel.Jolly good. I\\'ll get onto that at once.And take full advantageof the natural cover.Is this the Flying Saucer?Yeah. It sailed this morning.How reckless of me. I made you all wet.Yes, but my martini\\'s still dry.My name\\'s James.Hello, James. I\\'m Fatima Blush.You ski very well.I do many things very well.I\\'m sure you do.What brings you to Nassau, James?I\\'m fishing.For what?Anything I can get.I know the best waters.I\\'d be very happy to show them to you.Now, why would you want to do that?I\\'d like you to findwhat you\\'re looking for.I\\'m all yours.Yes?James, would you come down please?Right away.I think this should takecare of you perfectly.I\\'m sure it will.You\\'re marvelously well-equipped.Thank you, James.So are you.Thank you.What exactly are we going down for?Sport and a little fun.You appear tense.You affect me, James.Well, that\\'s bad.Going down, one should always be relaxed.Is it far to the reef?It\\'s far enough.We\\'ve got time to kill.It\\'s you.Well, you did say you\\'d catch me later.Oh, my God.623 and...Here you are. No messages.Hello?Mr. Bond, I\\'ve finally tracked you down.Small-Fawcett here.I hope I haven\\'t caughtyou at an awkward moment.No, not at all. Just be brief.I don\\'t have too much time.Just want you to know thatI\\'m on top of things.I\\'ve found out that Largo\\'s boat isen route for the south of France.Well done.It was nothing, really.If you\\'re free tomorrow, whydon\\'t we go snorkeling?Sounds a wonderful idea.Jolly good, Bond!Because I was wantingto discuss with you...What\\'s that?Mr. Bond?Proof that we made the right decision.About what, darling?Your place or mine.I found a villa for us justwhere you wanted. It\\'s perfect.The Flying Saucer isanchored in the bay below.And Q sent this.Thank you.- Catch!- Get down!- Felix.- Not bad.Not bad at all.

Enchant.Thank you. My car is right there.I ran some checks in the Langley computer.Anything on Largo?No, he\\'s squeaky clean.I must say, for once, yourhunch was wrong, buddy.- Algernon, right?- Yes.I had the first one of thosethings, and it blew up in my face.A motorbike came for you from England.Here\\'s the papers.What are you gonna do with this bike?I won\\'t know until I test it.It\\'s gonna be your ass, James.Thank you.Felix?Yeah.Forget the soup.Feast your eyes on that.What\\'ve you got here, James?That\\'s Largo\\'s lady.Her name is Domino. Domino Petachi.Petachi. The Air Force officerkilled in that car crash.Jack Petachi.That\\'s right. He was her brother.Well, there\\'s the man himself.If he\\'s got the bombs, do you thinkhe\\'d have them on his yacht?Unlikely. But get some scuba gear.We\\'ll check her out.Right.Welcome to the Centre de la Sant.I hope you enjoy our facilities.Do you serve men here?But of course.Some men more than others.Miss Petachi. No one told meyou were here. I am sorry.You speak English, yes?Yes. Quite well, in fact.Now, hard or soft massage?Hard, please.Well, perhaps we shouldbegin with your back.I don\\'t believe we\\'ve seenyou around here before.No, I was on a boat.And what boat would that be?The Flying Saucer.Mr. Largo\\'s boat.Yes. Do you know Mr. Largo?I know of him.I know he owns many beautiful things.Yes, he\\'s a very generous man, Mr. Largo.I\\'m sure he is.He\\'s giving a charity ball tonightat the casino, for children.What a worthy cause.Perhaps I should attend.I\\'d really like to ask you. I would.But I\\'m afraid the guest listis very restricted. I\\'m sorry.C\\'est la vie.C\\'est la vie?Such is life.Such is life.That feels so good.Certainly does.Excuse me?It certainly does need it.You have slight lesionsin the upper vertebrae.Could you go a little lower, please?Lower?Yes, please.Please.Right there.That feels so good.I am sorry, mademoiselle.We are so very busy today.Where\\'d the masseur go?Who?The man, the...The man I pass? He does not work here.They\\'ll never let you in.I\\'d better wait for you.No, Nicole. You go back to the villa.Find that villa.Wait a minute! You there!I shouldn\\'t have the fish.You must have an unreasonable fear ofgatecrashers to carry this heavy artillery.This bomb has a tiny gyroscope inside.Any lateral movement on your partand you could be served in an egg cup.If you understand what\\'s beingexplained to you, nod gently.Good boy. Stay.Hello again. I do owe you an explanation.My name is Bond. James Bond.May I offer you a drink?Hard or soft?Soft.I\\'ll have a double Bloody Mary withplenty of Worcestershire sauce.Hate to think what you mean by hard.Vodka on the rocks for me.I think you have lost her.Can you actually imaginethat I could lose a womanto a underpaid British agent?Yeah?Yeah.And I warn you, if he\\'snot executed at once,he\\'ll have your Domino turned over.Is it possible that youhave bungled your attemptsbecause you want him for yourself?Maximilian.Why torture yourselfover that kind of woman?Maybe one day you\\'ll haveto kill her, Fatima.Your sense of humor is delicious.What\\'s your brother up to these days?He\\'s on his way here. Ican\\'t wait to see him.How do you know my brother?Hello!You must be Mr. James Bond, right?Monsieur Largo.Yes, right. Are you a man who enjoys games?Depends with whom I\\'m playing.Yeah. Shall we? Join us.These are my friends. They honoredme by coming from all over the worldto lose their money formy favorite charity.And what might that be?Children. Orphan children.So, here we are.The game is called Domination.I designed it myself.But my problem is I\\'ve neveryet found a worthy adversary.No doubt I shall disappoint you, too.We\\'ll see.Darling?This game has one objective, power.We will be fighting for countries,chosen at random by the machine.But for this demonstration,I will choose France.Target areas will light up on the map.Whoever hits them first with hislaser beam will score a point.But there is another way to win.With your left hand, youcontrol two nuclear missiles.With your right hand, you controla shield to block my missiles.But if you fail...

That\\'s it.He\\'s never gone this far before.He\\'s certifiable.A tango, yes?What is it you\\'re after?In part, it\\'s about your brother.What about my brother?Did you know that your brotherwas working for Largo?That\\'s impossible. Jack is in the U.S.Air Force.That\\'s precisely why Largo used him.Your brother\\'s dead.Keep dancing. Largo is the prime suspect.Your brother was used and then eliminated.They move well together, don\\'t they?Today you have another chance.This time you\\'d better not fail.Number 12.Excellent.You dance amazingly well, Mr. Bond.It\\'s Domino, really.She\\'s such a pleasure to follow.I know.I\\'d love to have you for lunch.If you are still around tomorrow,why don\\'t you join us on our boat?Tomorrow\\'s not good for me.Why?I\\'m going to pick up Jack.No. That\\'s not possible.Jack phoned earlier to sayhe\\'d been delayed again.At least for another week, maybe two.Bye-bye.Thank you very much.Nicole?Nicole.Don\\'t touch him! He\\'s mine!Come on, come on! Come on, come on!Hold it.Sit up.Your gun.Carefully.Over here.Spread your legs.Good. Very good.You\\'re quite a man, Mr. James Bond.But I am a superior woman.Guess where you get the first one.Well, in view of your hatred of men...Liar!You know that making love to Fatima wasthe greatest pleasure of your life.Well, to be perfectly honest,there was this girl in Philadelphia...Shut up!I am the best.Yes. Yes, you\\'re right.In fact, I was going to put youin my memoirs as number one.Write.Write.Now write this.The greatest rapture in my life wasafforded me in a boat in Nassauby Fatima Blush.Signed James Bond, 007.I just remembered.It\\'s against service policy foragents to give out endorsements.Write!Right now?Right now.Not perfected yet.Good show, James. Q actuallycame through, didn\\'t he?How long have you been here?Long enough.Long enough for what?To see how you handled the lady.You did rather well.Come on. This way.Monsieur Largo is waiting for you, sir.Of course. Thank you.This way, sir.Hello.- Good morning.- Good morning.You are a bit early for lunch.I know. It\\'s rather embarrassing.Prepare for departure.Steward, get some clothes for my guest.I\\'m overwhelmed.I\\'m invited for lunch and given a cruise.Why? You had other plans?No, not at all. I\\'m at your disposal.Of course. Cigarette?No, not today, thank you.So...A drink? A vodka martini?Of course.This is my situation room.From here, the world comes to me.You could run a small government from here.Oh, no, I could run a largegovernment from here.What\\'s your latest venture?Oil.It\\'s a new departure for me,besides which all my other enterprisesare of little consequence.Well, if it\\'s that big, let\\'s hopeit doesn\\'t blow up in your face.Mr. Bond. Excuse me. I have work to do.Time is money.By the way, the staterooms are aft.Don\\'t forget, 12:00. Lunch.Mr. Bond, enjoy the ship.Mr. Bond!There\\'s some fresh clothesin your cabin, sir.If you\\'d like to follow me.Thank you.What happened to my brother?Why are you here?Just trust me.The Tears of Allah.Does that mean anything to you?This is it. He gave it to me.He said it was very valuable.It doesn\\'t look it.Have you any idea where we\\'re heading?North Africa.He\\'s got a house, a place called Palmyra.Somehow I\\'ve got to transmita message out of here.It could be risky, but I\\'mgoing to need your help.What do you want me to do?I\\'m going to kiss you.I want you to respond as if you liked it.I\\'m doing this for two very good reasons.One, because I\\'m hopingto provoke a reaction.And the other one?Because I always wanted to.False alarm! False alarm!All crew return to stations.We\\'ve just picked up a messagefrom one of our ships in the Med.I think it\\'s from Bond, sir.About time.Yes. He used our emergencycode Tango Zebra.\"Heading North Africa, Palmyra.\"Palmyra? Where is that?Haven\\'t a clue, sir.Well, find out about it, will you?I\\'ll do my best, sir.North Africa?Quite impressive, huh?Very.That\\'s my retreat, where I canescape and enjoy all my treasures.How do you like your new home, my princess?Bond, the game is over. Take him away.That belonged to Napoleon\\'s empress.That is my greatest treasure.Take it. Take it. But be careful.That is your wedding present.You betrayed me.But I forgive you.And what about my brother?Your brother...I hate you. I hate you.Domino! Domino!You\\'re crazy.Yeah, maybe I\\'m crazy.What a wonderful view.You\\'ll see.Every game has to have a winner.So... Ciao bello.Largo.Bond.In that case, where did you hide the bombs?You still think of escape?I must say, I admire your spirit.Well,bomb number one is rightunder the President\\'s feetin Washington DC.And number two?You were a very good secret agent. Really.Bye.I\\'m sure this will amuse you.Goodbye, Domino.Cover it up.Hold on.What are you doing?James!Bond, you\\'re a hard man to keep up with.Clear the line to Washington, Felix.That\\'s where the first bomb is.It was never like thiswhen I was in the Navy.Here we are.What\\'s the matter?You\\'re going back after Largo, aren\\'t you?Well, I have to.I want him as much as you do.Probably more.I can understand you hating him.Maybe I don\\'t hate himenough to risk losing you.But I don\\'t want to risk losing me, either.Commander Bond, the Washingtonbomb has been located and defused.Now, sir, from London, yourchief wants to speak to you.This is M. We\\'ve cracked thecode for disarming the warheads,but we\\'ve only got five hoursto find the second bomb.Now, as you perfectly well know,I have absolute confidence in you, and I...That\\'s what kept me going, sir.Bond, all right, then,I\\'ll be brief with you.And I know you\\'ve got your hands full.If you should come throughthis fearful ordeal unscathed,I\\'d like to offer youlunch at my club. Over.That\\'s a thrilling prospect, sir.But if I do get through this,I may have other plans.Steady at 300.Steady at 300.There she is, sir.What\\'s she reading?Seven fathoms, sir.No way we can get in there.The water\\'s too shallow.Nothing. Nothing moving on board.AWAC surveillance reportsno sightings on shore.Now why did Largo anchor here?Your pendant. Give it to me.This is The Tears of Allah.The story goes that the Prophetwept, and his tears made a well.The contours are the same.The diamond must mark a place.That would be about here.Right where the oilfields begin.Sir, there is underwateractivity in the area.Check the area for underwater caves.Right, sir.Sonar signals do indicatea cavity below sea levelat 015 degrees.There\\'s an underground river right there.Commander Pederson, are youequipped with the new XT-7Bs?That\\'s top secret. Howdo you know about them?From a Russian translation ofone of your service manuals.Sorry about that.Ports open. Fire one.Fire two. Cut track.Be careful of the housing.Watch it.I\\'ve got to go in.We don\\'t have much time.Give the sub our positionand get some help.All right.Kovacs? Kovacs? Come.You\\'re not in the right place. Please.Well done, Dr. Kovacs.Go ahead. Go ahead.When the warhead is ready for itsfinal voyage, we will drink a toast.There is nothing that can stop us anymore.The guide rope. Keep the tension.The Tears of Allah.Sweet, like money.For centuries, this hasbeen a monument to power,but nothing like what we now possess.Huh, Kovacs?Everybody stay undercover!You, get up there!Leiter, stay down!What took you so long?Hold up on the heavy stuff!Bond is still in there!It\\'s armed.Largo got away with the warhead.Call down a chopper.I\\'m going to try the oasis. Good luck.Bond\\'s clear! We\\'re moving in!There you are.I always have a martini at 5:00.You\\'ll never give upyour old habits, James.No, you\\'re wrong. Those days are over.Oh, no.I\\'m sorry, Mr. Bond.Obviously caught you at a bad moment.M sent you.Only to plead for your return, sir.M says that without you in the service,he fears for the securityof the civilized world.Never again.Never?Never say never again.Never, never say never again.You walk in a room.A woman can feel the heat.One look is a guarantee.Nights could be long and sweet.The message is clear.Like nothing I\\'ve ever known.But from all that I hear.Forget about long-range plans.\\'Cause this man\\'s got his own.To get mixed up with.A man who says never.May be big trouble, but thenI just could be the woman to take you.And make you never say never again.Never, never say never again.Never, never say never again.Never, never say never again.Never, never say never again.You\\'ve got all the moves.Oh, but, baby, I got them, too.No matter your attitude or your moodI\\'ll come through.The touch of your voice.The feel of your eyes on me.You leave me no choice.Though I know there\\'s danger thereI don\\'t care, let it be.To get in bed with.A man who says never.May have no future, but thenI just could be the woman to reach you.And teach you to never say never againI\\'ll beg you I\\'ll get youI\\'ll reach you I\\'ll teach youI\\'ll take you I\\'ll make younanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=never-say-never-again',\n",
       " 'It\\'s time to get out.Don\\'t bleed to death.Hello, Mitchell.Bond.The Americans are going to benone too pleased about this.I promised them Le Chiffreand they got Le Chiffre.They got his body.If they\\'d wanted his soul theyshould have made a deal with a priest.Has he said anything?No.Going to check the perimeter Ma\\'am.You look like hell.When was the last time you slept?Vesper\\'s boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,the one who was abducted in Morocco,the one she was trying to save.His body was washedup on a beach in Ibiza.We\\'re meant to believe the fish did that tohis face. His wallet and ID were in his pocket.Well that\\'s convenient.Quite.Which is why I did a DNA check on a lockof his hair found in Vesper\\'s apartment.It\\'s not him.A lock of his hair? I wouldn\\'t havethought Vesper the sentimental type.Well we never really know anyone, do we?But I do need to know Bond.I need to know that I can trust you.And you don\\'t?Well, it\\'d be a pretty cold bastard who didn\\'twant revenge for the death of someone he loved.You don\\'t have to worry about me.I\\'m not going to go chasinghim. He\\'s not important.And neither was she.It\\'s clear Ma\\'am.Thanks Mitchell.Shall we?You going to tell us who you work for?I was always veryinterested to meet you.I\\'d heard so much about you from Vesper.The real shame is, if she hadn\\'tkilled herself, we would\\'ve had you too.I think you would\\'vedone anything for her.Well you know you\\'re not in Britain,and God knows where you\\'ll be tomorrow.Which should tell you that eventually youwill tell us about the people you work with.And the longer it takes, themore painful we\\'ll make it.You really don\\'t know anything about us.It\\'s so amusing because, we onthe other side, are thinking, oh...the MI6, the CIA, they\\'relooking over our shoulders,they\\'re listening to our conversations, andthe truth is you don\\'t even know we exist.Oh we do now Mr. White,and we\\'re quick learners.Well then, the first thing you should knowabout us is that we have people everywhere.Am I right?Anything?Craig Mitchell workedfor me for 8 years.He passed a full security checkand lie detector test every year,and didn\\'t leave so much as ascrap of paper to explain any of it.I found this,and three other bloody Christmaspresents I bought him, about the house.I don\\'t think he smoked.And you had to kill him! Youcouldn\\'t bring him in for questioning,so that we mightactually learn something.When someone says \"We\\'ve got peopleeverywhere\", you expect it to be hyperbole.Lots of people say that,florists use that expression.Doesn\\'t mean they\\'ve got someoneworking for them inside the bloody room.What the hell is this organization Bond?How can they be everywhereand we know nothing about them?I assume we found no trace of White.No.The agent guarding the door in the garagewas dead before you passed him on the stairs.I passed him on the stairs? Christ!Mitchell must have killed him whenhe went out to check the perimeter.You\\'re lucky to be here.You think White is still alive?Yes I do.What is it?Craig Mitchell, 45 yearsold, no living family,Tell me that you know more than that.Our money men went through everybill in Mitchell\\'s wallet and house.How much did he have?Less than 100 pounds.And about the same in euros and dollars.Excuse me, excuse me ma\\'am.We\\'ve done a complete forensic analysisof every note and its traceable history.Not in the mood.After you.This particular note from Mitchell\\'swallet might be of interest.We introduced tagged bills into LeChiffre\\'s money laundering operation,by intercepting illegal payoffs.We traced money through several ofhis bank accounts around the world.That\\'s pretty thin.At the rate money changes hands, you couldprobably find a tenner in my robe with a tag.That\\'s true ma\\'am, a single bill could bea coincidence, but what about a whole stack?These bills from

Uh, hi, thisis Gregory Beam, Ma\\'am.Hello, Mr. Beam.Uh, I\\'m so sorry to keep you waiting.We have no interest in Mr. Greene.Thank you, Mr. Beam.- Connection terminated.He\\'s a person of extreme interest.But he just said that he wasn\\'t...- Tanner,I asked about the man and she transferredme to the section chief of South America.How would she know to do thatif they weren\\'t tracking him?Bond, we have your locationas approaching an airfield...is Greene on the move?Yeah, I\\'ve got a tail number: Golf,Zero, Charlie, Sierra, Charlie.Can you give me a destination?It\\'s a private charter going toBregenz, Austria.

Come, have a seat.Jeez!Sorry.How much longer?So do we have an understanding?Uh, yeah...you do nothing to stop a coupin Bolivia, and in exchange,the new government gives Americathe lease to any oil found.If it\\'s oil you want.Well, you didn\\'t find diamonds, did ya?Ah, drill it underground, it\\'s kept offeverybody\\'s radar for a very long time butyou can\\'t buy that much piping,without somebody getting curious.We\\'ll have to verify the find.I am not even admitting there isone, you are getting this for free.Venezuela, Brazil, now Bolivia.With you tied up in the Middle East,South America is falling like dominoes.You don\\'t need another marxist givingnational resources to the people do you?No, we can hardly be expected to dosomething about a coup we know nothing about.Hmm, I have a... pest.You have any idea who that is?Sorry.It\\'s James Bond,British secret service.Don\\'t know how I could have missed that.I will need you toget rid of him for me.Yeah.That\\'s not gonna be a problem.You know who Greene is and you want to putus in bed with him, you are kidding right?Yeah, you\\'re right, we shouldjust deal with nice people.I need to know you\\'reon the team, Felix.I need to know you value your career.Good to see you.- Good.Thank you.How much more pipelinedo we need, ideally?Are there any objections?No.- Not Here.No objections.Transfer the funds fromour Siberian holdings.Done.Where do the Americans stand?The CIA doesn\\'t care about anotherdictator as long as they get their hand.But when they find outthat they\\'ve been duped?I\\'m working on that.I\\'m still not sure that the Tierraproject is the best use of Quantum\\'s time.Perhaps we should shiftour focus to the Canadian.This is the world\\'smost precious resource,we need to control asmuch of it as we can.Bolivia must be top priority.Can I offer an opinion?I really think you people shouldfind a better place to meet.Where do you think you\\'re going?Thank you.Well, Tosca isn\\'t for everyone.Drop it!So who are you working for?Piss off.Get rid of anything we broughtwith us. We\\'ve been compromised.I asked you who you were working for.Is he one of ours?No.Then he shouldn\\'t be looking at me.Get me M.Fraulein...Hents, connect call.We\\'ve ID\\'d the pictures.Show me.Gregor Karakov: former minister, nowowns most of the mines in Siberia,Moeshi Saroff: formerMossad, now telecom giant,and Guy Haines: specialenvoy to the prime minister.Get Bond.There\\'s something else.It appears Bond shot Haines\\'bodyguard and threw him off a roof.Where are you?Did you get my pictures?Was this a conversation?Can you link these people?Is that stress in your voice?I need you to come in and debrief.I don\\'t have time.Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.I did my best not to.You shot him at point blank and threw him offa roof. I\\'d hardly call that showing restraint.Especially since he was amember of special branch.So who was he guarding?Bond, are you missing the fact thatyou killed a member of special branch?I need you to come in.And I would,but right now I need to findthe men who tried to kill you.Go back to sleep.- Connection Terminated.Restrict Bond\\'s movements.Cancel his cards.Put an alert on hispassports, all of them.And I want to know everythingwe don\\'t know about Haines.Yes Ma\\'am.And Tanner...be careful who you trust with this.Hopefully you\\'re a betterjudge of character than I am.You want to follow yourfriends to La Paz, Bolivia?Please.Oh...I\\'m sorry sir, but this doesn\\'t work.Do you have another card?No.Could you do me a favour?You\\'re going to get aphone call in a minute,would you mind tellingthem I\\'m headed for Cairo?I\\'d be happy to.Thank you.Ocean Sky, Guten Abend?Mathis.What do you want?Come to apologize?You know Mathis, I thinkretirement suits you.None for him.Sorry if he\\'s in a bad mood today.I need a passport andmatching credit card.MI6 run out of plastic?Well oddly, right now you\\'re theonly person I think I can trust.That is odd.But I guess when one\\'s young, it seems veryeasy to distinguish between the right and wrong.But as one gets older,it becomes more difficult.The villains and theheros get all mixed up.I was sorry to hear about Vesper.I think she loved you.Hmm, right up until themoment she betrayed me.She died for you.Why did you really want to see me?I need some information.You have some hard friends.This man, is some kind of facilitator.Fingers in many pies, andthey don\\'t leave any prints.These men were together?They\\'re buying up oil pipeline.Something called the \"Tierra Project.\"Do you know it?- Destroy these.That\\'s Guy Haines. You don\\'t know him?Should I?I suppose not.You haven\\'t been keepingsecrets as long as I have.He keeps a very low profile,but he is one of the PrimeMinister\\'s closest advisors.They say you\\'re judged bythe strength of you enemies.You know anything about Bolivia?I was stationed in SouthAmerica for 7 years.Well, do you have some contacts there?A few.What do you want to know?Come with me.You can\\'t sleep?May I fix you a drink, sir?What are you drinking?- I don\\'t know, what am I drinking?one of vodka, half a measure ofKina Ole?- Kina Ole, which is not vermouth.Shaken well until it is ice coldand served with a large,thin slice of lemon peel.Six of them.That\\'s impressive.They\\'re good, you should have one.Oh, it\\'ll just keep me awake.So what\\'s keeping you awake?I was wondering why you came with me.It takes something toadmit you were wrong.You want a sleeping pill?No.Pain pills?I have pills for everything.Some make you taller...some make you forget.I am going to try and get some sleep.Good idea.Thank you.Mr. Bond, my name is Fields,I\\'m from the consulate.Well, of course you are, and whatdo you do at the consulate, Fields?That\\'s not important. Myorders are to turn you aroundand put you on the firstplane back to London.Those orders include my friend Mathis.I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t know who you are.You see that? Gone such ashort time, already forgotten.Oh, you\\'re just saying that to hurt me.Mr. Bond, these orders come fromthe highest possible authorities.Taxi.Fields,When is the next flight to London?Tomorrow morning.Well then we have all night.If you attempt to flee, I willarrest you, drop you off in jailand take you to the planein chains.

Congratulations.Wonderful speech, Dominic.Thank you.Miss Fields, Mr. Bond,my friend Carlos.Nice to meet you.Ma\\'am.Mr Bond, Mathis has spokena great deal about you.I want you to knowmy entire police forceis at your disposal.Well, that could be very useful.You know, there are people in this country spendinghalf their paycheck just to get clean water.What do you think of that?The Bolivian government is the problem.They cut down trees, then act surprisedwhen the water andsoil, wash out to sea.I couldn\\'t agree more.I hope this figure is to your liking.Cherie, you shouldn\\'t tease.Why don\\'t you tell them about allthe land you bought up outside Potosi?It\\'s been a pleasure.Would you excuse me?Somehow, the logging rights went to a multinationalcorporation, that cut down the forests.But only after our last governmentsold the land to Greene Planet.Oh, have I got my facts crossed?- Yes, I think you did.You will excuse us?What a wonderful night.You just cost me quitea bit of money, darling.You can\\'t put a price on integrity.I can try.Tell me you didn\\'t drop bytonight just to piss on my parade,or are you still after thisgeneral\\'s head, for your mantel?A little of both.Tell me where Medrano is, and maybeyou won\\'t lose any more inverstors.You are really breaking my heart,choosing an insect like that over me.You\\'re going to throw me over?Well, you\\'ve beendrinking. Maybe you slipped.Oh... just think how much you\\'d miss me.Good evening. There you are.Would you excuse me?Mr. Bond...Thats a pleasure.Well, careful with this one.She won\\'t go to bed with youunless you give hersomething she really wants.It\\'s a shame because she\\'s really quitestunning once you... get her on her back.I wish I could saythis feeling was mutual.I\\'m sorry Mr. Greene,but we have to go-Please, my friends call me Dominic.I\\'m sure they do.How much do you know about Bond, Camille?Because he\\'s rather a tragic case.His MI6 says he\\'s difficult to control.Nice way of saying that everythinghe touches, seems to wither and die.Shall we?Doesn\\'t bode well for you, I\\'m afraid.You two do make acharming couple, though.You\\'re both... what\\'s the expression?Damaged goods.Oh my gosh!I\\'m so sorry.Come on, lighten up.You\\'re cramping my style.So it\\'s British intelligence now?What the hell do you want from me?You\\'re gonna show me DominicGreene\\'s \"Tierra Project.\"Are you up to it?- Do I have a choice?Do you want one?There\\'s something horriblyefficient about you.What a compliment.What\\'s the bet that Dominic Greenehas friends in the police force?Stay here.Buenas NochesNow why would you want me to do that?Mathis.There\\'s a hospital onthe other side of town.Please... stay with me.Stay here, please.Come here.Okay.That\\'s better.That doesn\\'t hurt.Is Mathis your cover name?Yes.Not a very good one, is it?Do we forgive each other?I shouldn\\'t have left you alone.Vesper...she did everything for you.Forgive her.Forgive yourself.Is that how you treat your friends?He wouldn\\'t care.Let\\'s go.The Foreign Secretaryis asking to see you.What don\\'t I know?Rene Mathishas been shot in Bolivia.The police claim it was Bond.How much did you pay him?- Well, he wanted you.But I left him the car as collateral.He\\'ll make much morewhen he sells us out.Alright, let\\'s see ifthis thing will fly.Here...all the information I found saidthere was nothing of value there.But Greene\\'s geologistshad proof that there was.My sources tell me you\\'reBolivian Secret Service...or used to be.I think you infiltrated Greene\\'sorganization by having sex with him.That offends you?- No, not in the slightest.So what\\'s your interest in Greene?Well, amongst other things, hetried to kill a friend of mine.A woman?- Yes,but it\\'s not what you think.Your mother?Do not ask.What\\'s that, down there?That\\'s a sinkhole, thereare a few around here.Just for the record,I wasn\\'t with Greene for my-I think we lost him.He\\'s coming for us!It\\'s right behind you!Here! Put that on!Come on!According to the Bolivians,it was a routine stop,and when they discovered Mathis\\'body, Bond disarmed and shot them.Of course there are nowitnesses to prove otherwise.I need something. Ican\\'t go in there unarmed.I\\'m sorry, there\\'s nothing.Come in.What\\'s today\\'s excuse?That Bond is legally blind?No, Minister.I don\\'t think I need to tellyou how upset the P.M. is.With respect, the P.M.has my direct line.And he\\'d of used it, ifhe\\'d wanted to speak to you.I\\'m sorry M, times have changed. We\\'vehad long discussions with our cousins.Mr. Greene\\'s interestsand ours now align.Minister, this man is a majorplayer in one of the most dangerousand powerful organizations-- We\\'ve never even heard of.Foreign policy cannot be conductedon the basis of hunches and innuendo.Then give us time to gather enoughevidence, so you can make informed decisions.Fine.Say you\\'re right. SayGreene is a villain.If we refused to business with villians,we\\'d have almost no one to trade with.The world\\'s running out of oil, M.The Russians aren\\'t playing ball,the Americans and Chineseare dividing up what\\'s left.Right or wrong doesn\\'t come intoit. We\\'re acting out of necessity.Bond... is running wild. Who\\'sto say he hasn\\'t been turned?Pull him in, or theAmericans will put him down.I think I\\'ve found a way out.You\\'re freezing.I\\'m fine.So what is it thatGreene has and you want?It\\'s not Greene, it\\'s Medrano.The man you met in Haiti.My father, worked forthe military junta.He was a very cruel man.But he was my father.When I was a small child, the oppositionsend General Medrano to our house.He shot my father... did thingsto my mother and my sister...and then strangled them while I watched.I was to young to be any trouble.So he just smiled at me...and set the house on fire.He left his mark.So, when I pulled you off the boat...I waited years for that chance.I apologize.Seems we\\'re both usingGreene to get to somebody.You lost somebody?I did, yes.You catch whoever did it?No, not yet.Tell me when you do,I\\'d like to know how it feels.We should go.You ready?They\\'ve used dynamite.This used to be a riverbed.Greene isn\\'t after theoil, he wants the water.We can\\'t leave it like this.It\\'s one dam.He\\'s creating a drought,and he\\'ll build others.Excuse me sir. Your wife left a message.The English woman. She leftit for you this morning.Thank you.- My pleasure.What is it?Would you mind waiting down here?I\\'ll be outside.So that\\'s what she meant.I hope you can trust these men.Just a moment. It\\'s Tanner.Yes?We\\'ve got the girl downstairs, she says totell you she\\'s sorry, but this isn\\'t her fight.It isn\\'t, let her go.She isn\\'t our concern.Well, I\\'m disappointed.You are?How much oil did theAmericans promise you?This isn\\'t about oil.- Well that\\'s good, because there isn\\'t any.It\\'s about trust.You said you weren\\'tmotivated by revenge.I\\'m motivated by my duty.No.I think you\\'re so blinded by inconsolablerage that you don\\'t care who you hurt.When you can\\'t tell your friendsfrom your enemies, it\\'s time to go.You might like to still hold yourtheory about there being no oil.Her lungs are full of it.It was Greene.No doubt. But why?It\\'s just misdirection-- I mean why her Bond?She was just supposed to send you home.She worked in an office,collecting reports.Look how well you charm works, James.They\\'ll do anything for you, won\\'t they?How many is that now?You\\'re removed from duty and suspended,pending further investigation.You\\'ll give whatever weapons you haveto these men and leave with them now.Miss Fields showed true bravery. Iwant that mentioned in your report.Now you and need to see this through.There\\'s nowhere to go.There\\'s a capture orkill order out on you.Who would\\'ve done that?Ma\\'am?- Find out where he\\'s going.He\\'s onto something.Ma\\'am, the CIA is insisting-- I don\\'t give a shit about the CIA,or their trumped up evidence.He is my agent, and I trust him.Go on.Get in.You gonna try and shoot me?I said get in.You\\'re gonna get botulismif you keep drinking that.It\\'s bottled water.It probably came from some stream,just around the corner from here,bunch of little kids peeing in it.That\\'s why I eat the peppers.- Well, all I\\'m saying is,you can\\'t trust adamn thing around here!Lincoln Exportar, beunos noches.You know you couldjust answer CIA, Felix.A taxi driver told mewhere the office was.Well, if we\\'re so easy to find,James, you really should come visit.Or maybe you should come outand see some more of the city.I heard a rumor you\\'d gone native.Felix.You know, I was just wonderingwhat South America would look like,if nobody gave a damnabout coke or communism.It always impressed me the wayyou boys would carve this place up.I\\'ll take that as acompliment coming from a Brit.Are you sure you\\'replaying with the right side?Regimes change once a week down here,Medrano will be nodirtier than the next guy.Oh you see, that\\'s what Ilike about U.S. intelligence,you\\'ll lie down with anybody.- Including you, brother,including you.- Do you know you\\'re being played?Dominic Greene is gonna suck this place dry,and then he\\'s gonna more on and you\\'re gonnabe left picking up the broken crockery.What can I tell you? There\\'sno such thing as a free lunch.You see Felix, I don\\'t think you\\'rehalf as cynical as you make out to be.You don\\'t know me.Why?Just because you didn\\'t come alone?How long have I got?Well, that doesn\\'t giveus a lot of time, does it?Medrano can\\'t move until he paysoff the army and the police chief.Greene\\'s bringing him his money now, at a hotelcalled \"Perola de las Dunas\", in the desert.Thank you, Felix.James.Move your ass.What the hell happened?What\\'d you tell him?Just what we agreed on.What\\'re you doing?It\\'s slide is cocked.Maybe you should check your own.I will.Have you ever killed someone?The training will tell you that when theadrenalin kicks in, you should compensate.But part of you is not gonna believe thetraining, because this kill is personal.Take a deep breath.You only need one shot,make it count.In euros, as requested.The dollar isn\\'t what it once was.The cost of the war.I\\'m afraid that the corruption in thiscurrent government, can no longer be tolerated.Presidente?And mine?Very tough for you to sign over my land.My first official act.And this, if you would.What is this?As of this moment, my organization ownsmore than 60% of Bolivia\\'s water supply.For this contract statesthat, your new government,will use us as utilities provider.This is double what we are paying now.Oh, well, then don\\'t sign it.But, you should know somethingabout me and the people I work with.We deal with the left or theright. Dictators or liberators.If the current president had been moreagreeable, I wouldn\\'t be talking to you.If you decide not to sign,you\\'ll wake up with your ballsin your mouth, and your willingreplacement standing over you.If you doubt that, then shoot me, takethat money, and have a good night\\'s sleep.You and I had a mutual friend!Sounds like you just lost another one!Not this way, not thisway! I can\\'t, I can\\'t!Make your shot.Take a deep breath.Make it count.Come on!Wait here.You promised that you\\'d-Let you go?I answered your questions.I told you what you wantedto know about Quantum.Yes, you did.And your friends would know that,so they\\'re probably looking for you.But the good news is...you\\'re in the middle of the desert.Here,I bet you make it 20 miles,before you consider drinking that.Goodbye, Mr. Greene.Thank you.It\\'s my pleasure.Are you alright?Fine.But I keep thinking,he\\'s dead, and now what?Well, the dam we sawwill have to come down.And there\\'ll be others too. Someonewho worked for Greene might be of help.Not a bad idea.Do you think I\\'ll be able to sleep now?I don\\'t think the deadcare about vengeance.I wish... I could set you free.But your prison is in there.Fine, anything for an easy life.Sit down.Sit down!It\\'s okay, baby.You\\'re Canadian?You work in Canadian Intelligence?It\\'s alright, I know you do.And knowing this man,I\\'d guess you have access tosome very sensitive material,which you\\'re gonna be forced to give up.His life will be threatened, andbecause you love him, you won\\'t hesitate.It\\'s a beautiful necklace.Did he give it to you?I have one just like it.He gave it to a friend of mine.Someone very close to me.Your name is?- Corine.Corine.Corine, I suggest you leavenow, you contact your peopleand you tell them to checktheir seals, they have a leak.Do it now, please.This man and I havesome unfinished business.Thank you.Please,make it quick.Is he still alive?He is.I\\'m surprised.Did you find what you were looking for?Yes.- Good.I assume you have no regrets.- I don\\'t.What about you?Of course not. Itwould be unprofessional.They found Greene dead in the middleof the Bolivian desert, of all places.Two bullets in the back of his skull.They found motor oil in his stomach.Does that mean anything to you?Wish I could help.You\\'ll be glad to know, I straightenedthings out with the Americans.Your friend Leiter has been promoted.He\\'ll replace Beam.Well then, the rightpeople kept their jobs.Something like that.Congratulations, you were right.About what?About Vesper.Ma\\'am.Bond.I need you back.I never left.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=james-bond-007-quantum-of-solace',\n",

He`s clean.Pulse 72.Blood pressure 120 over 80.Indications of neurotoxins, histamine,serotonin, enzyme inhibitors.Scorpion venom.Also traces of a venom antiserum.They`d sting him,then administer the antidote.Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.Liver not too good.It`s definitely him, then.Morning.Welcome back.Such hospitality.You don`t seem too pleased to see me.If I`d had my way,you`d still be in North Korea.Your freedom came at too high a price.Zao.He tried to blow up a summitbetween South Korea and China.Took out three Chinese agentsbefore he was caught.And now he`s free.I never asked to be traded.- I`d rather die in prison than let him loose.- You had your cyanide.Threw it away years ago.What the hell is this about?The top US agent in the North KoreanHigh Command was executed last week.The Americans intercepted a signalfrom your prison naming him.- And they think it`s me?- You were the only inmate.They concluded you crackedand were haemorrhaging information.We had to get you out.And what do you think?With drugs, you wouldn`t knowwhat you did or didn`t say.I know the rules.And number one is no deals.Get caught and you`re given up.The mission was compromised.Moon got a call exposing me.He had a partner in the West.Even his father knew about it.- Whether that`s true or not, it`s irrelevant.- No, it isn`t.The same person who set me up thenhas just set me up again to get Zao out.So I`m going after him.The only place you`re goingis our evaluation centre in the Falklands.- Double-O status rescinded.- Along with my freedom?For as long as I deem necessary, yes.You`re no use to anyone now.- He`s gone into cardiac arrest.- Crash trolley. Notify his superiors. Now!He`s flatlining on the ECG.Get me some atropine. We`re losing him!Stand by. Clear.I`m checkin` out.Thanks for the kiss of life.Security breach on level three.All personnel defensive, code red.Apprehend and detain with force.Security breach on level three.All personnel defensive, code red.Apprehend and detain with force.Security breach on level three.All personnel defensive, code red.My usual suite, please.Do you have a credit card?Or even any luggage, sir?Mr Bond, so good to see you.It`s been a long time.Mr Chang.Open the Presidential Suite.Could you send up my tailorand some food?The lobster`s good,with quails` eggs and sliced seaweed.- And if there`s any left, a `61 Bollinger.- Of course.Do it quickly.Been busy, have we, Mr Bond?Just surviving, Mr Chang.Just surviving.I am Peaceful Fountains of Desire.The masseuse.I come with compliments of the manager.I`m sure you do. Come in.On the bed, please. Face down.Yes, of course.I`m not that kind of masseuse.I`m not that kind of customer.You think I haven`t always knownyou`re Chinese Intelligence, Chang?- Hong Kong`s our turf now, Bond.- Don`t worry. I`m not here to take it back.Put your hands down.What the hell do you want?Just to help you settle a score.Zao killed three of your men.You get me into North Korea,I`ll take care of him for you.What`s in it for you?Chance to get even.Zao has information I need.- I`ll have to ask Beijing.- Do it.Now get out. Unless youreally want to give me a massage.Ah, Mr Bond.A little ``thank you`` from us.- Cuba?- It seems Mr Zao`s lost himself in Havana.If you find him, say goodbye from us.With pleasure.- S?- I`m here to pick up Delectados.Delectados? We haven`tmade Delectados in 30 years.I`m from Universal Exports.Check with your boss.Follow me.Your passport, seor.I`d come to think the Delectadoswould never be smoked.They are particularly hazardousfor one`s health, Mr...Bond.Mr Bond.- D`you know why?- It`s the addition of the Volado tobacco.Slow-burning.It never goes out.- Just like a sleeper.- Sorry for the rude awakening.I love my country, Mr Bond.I`d never ask you to betray your people.I`m after a North Korean.- A tourist?- A terrorist.One man`s terroristis another man`s freedom fighter.Zao has no interestin other people`s freedom.I still have some friends in high places.Favours called in.Some dollars spread about.We find your friend is here,on an island in Los Organos.There is a strange clinicrun by Dr. Alvarez Alvarez.He leads the field in gene therapy.Increasing the life expectancyof our beloved leaders.And, of course, the richest Westerners.We may have lost our freedomin the revolution, but...we have a health system second to none.You don`t seem to have donebadly out of the revolution.We all have our ways of getting by.You`d be surprised how manygovernment officials come to mefor reminders of the decadent times.Ah, yeah, well.- Mind if I borrow these?- Please.My sources tell me this Zao is dangerous.I wish I could give you more help.I could use a fast car.Mojito, por favor.Mr Krug, your admittance papersfor the Alvarez Clinic tomorrow.About bloody time, Fidel.Now round up some more girlsand take them to room 42.Unless you want to beknown as Fidel Castrato.Magnificent view.It is, isn`t it?Too bad it`s lost on everybody else.Mojito?You should try it.Giacinta Johnson.My friends call me Jinx.My friends call me James Bond.Jinx, you say.Born on Friday the 13th.Do you believe in bad luck?Let`s just saymy relationships don`t seem to last.I know the feeling.Predators usually appear at sunset.- And why is that?- It`s when their prey comes out to drink.Too strong for you?I could learn to like it, if I had the time.How much time have you got?- Until dawn. What about you?- Oh, I`m just here for the birds.Ornithologist.Ornithologist, huh?Wow. Now there`s a mouthful.So you`re gonna be busy tonightwith the owls then, huh?No owls in Los Organos.Nothing to see till the morning.Not out there, anyway.So what do predators do...when the sun goes down?They feast...like there`s no tomorrow.Are you always this frisky?I`ve been missing the touchof a good woman.Who says I`m good?What the hell do you want?I don`t need a wheelchair.No?You do now.- Buenos das!- Hola!Seor.- OK.- Gracias.Buenos das!So you are to haveDNA replacement therapy.Let me explain the two phases.First, we kill off your bone marrow,wipe the DNA slate clean.Phase two: introduction of new DNAharvested from healthy donors -orphans, runaways,people that won`t be missed.I like to think of myself as an artist.And this is when I create.Thank you.It is a painful process, I`m afraid.But... all great art is.I`ll certainly enjoy working on you.Of course, you know,most artists are only truly appreciatedafter they`re dead.My father was a sergeant.We lived in Hampshire.I have fond memories of the countryside.Oh, good.Got your attention.Who`s bankrollingyour makeover, Zao? Hm?Same person whoset me up in North Korea?James? What`s goin` on?Jinx, you`ve gotta get out of here now!Move! Move!Vamos! Vamos!Vamos!Move it! Move it! Let`s go!See, my friend, the chemical compositionshows this is from Sierra Leone.- Conflict diamonds.- Yeah.There`s some kind of marking here.- ``GG.``- Let me see.Oh, yes.From the Graves Corporation in Iceland.That`s his laser signature.A man called Gustav Graves discovereddiamonds there a year or so ago.Yet they`re identical to conflict diamonds.What an amazing coincidence.How can he escape from a British warshipin Hong Kong right under your nose?- Interesting station, Moneypenny?- All I got was a storm warning.You were supposed to throw awaythe key, not leave the door wide open.Are you implying I had a handin his escape, Mr Falco?Well, Bond got away real fast, didn`t he?It is what he`s trained to do.Your boy`s been busy in his training. Heshowed up in Cuba and torches a clinic.Listen, you put your house in order,or we`re gonna do it for you.Your drink, sir.Lucky I asked for it shaken.- When`s he coming?- I don`t know.- Looks like your man won`t make it.- Actually, he`s right on time.- Wonderful day to become a knight.- Will you use your title, Mr Graves?I`m proud of my adopted nation,but I`d never stand on ceremony.After that entrance,you can`t be surprised to be called- a self-publicising, adrenaline junkie.- I prefer the term ``adventurer``.There are rumours about the Icarusspace programme. What`s the secret?It`s not a secret, it`s a surprise.You`ll soon be enlightened.You seem to work 24-seven.Is it true you don`t need sleep?You only get one shot at life.Why waste it on sleep?Are you trying out for the British Olympicfencing team? You`ve trained furiously.I never get furious. As they say in fencing,``What`s the point?``Thank you very much. We don`t wantto keep Her Majesty waiting any longer.- Mr Graves?- Mr Graves?Hit.That`s a hit.Verity?James Bond.Your lesson.I see you handle your weapon well.I have been known to keep my tip up.Do you mind? I think I`ve come undone.Why not?Hit. Positions.Play.Feast your eyes on the club`s finest blade.- Gustav Graves?- His publicist, Miranda Frost.Et l!My protge.Gorgeous, isn`t she?She took the gold at Sydney.- By default, if I remember.- Default?The one who beat her OD`d on steroids.Miranda deserved that gold.Now she`s teaching Graveshow to win one.He only plays for cash.He`s won so much,nobody else wants to fight him.You wanna meet him?Absolutely.Lead on.- Gustav.- Verity.- And Mr...?- Bond.James Bond.Have we met before?Oh, I think I`d remember.Of course you would. My mistake.- Are you a gambling man, Mr Bond?- If the stakes are right.L1 ,000 a point too much for you?Care to place a bet, Verity?No, thanks.I don`t like cockfights.Shall we?Excuse me.Best of three hits?Positions.Ready. Play.En garde.Hit. Positions.Play.Et l!Hit.- D`you want to continue?- D`you want to up the wager?How much can you afford?Let`s play for this.I picked it up in Cuba.I believe it`s one of yours.My, my.They do get around.But, then, diamonds are for everyone.Brilliant specimen. Completely flawless.And chemically identicalto African conflict diamonds.Then you`re about to losesomething very precious.Positions.Ready. Play.En garde.Oh, dear.You want to continue?Of course I want to bloody continue!But since we`re upping the wager,let`s up the weapons, shall we?Yeah.Let`s do this the old-fashioned way.First blood drawn from the torso.Steady on!That is enough!It`s just a little sport, Miranda.It seems you beat me, Mr Bond.Settle downstairs, shall we?Miranda.You`re a rare challenge, Mr Bond.I`m putting on a scientific demonstrationin Iceland at the weekend. Icarus?Join us. Miranda, make the arrangements.Once I`ve smoothedthings over with the club.What would I do without you?Can I expect the pleasure of youin Iceland?You`ll never have that pleasure, Mr Bond.Excuse me, Commander Bond.Someone left this for you.Place needed redecorating anyway.I heard of this place.Never thought I`d find myself here.Some things are best kept underground.An abandoned stationfor abandoned agents.- Your calling card.- So what have you got on Graves?You burn me.- And now you want my help.- What did you expect, an apology?Oh, I know you`ll dowhatever it takes to get the job done.- Just like you.- The difference is I won`t compromise.Well, I don`t have the luxuryof seeing things as black and white.- While you were gone the world changed.- Not for me.You`re suspicious of Graves,or I wouldn`t be here right now.- So, what do you have?- Nothing beyond the official biography.Orphan working in an Argentiniandiamond mine learns engineering.Makes a huge find in Icelandand gives half of it to charity.From nothing to everythingin no time at all.- And his demonstration this weekend?- Probably just another publicity stunt.Now, tell me what you knowabout this Cuban clinic.Gene therapy. New identitiescourtesy of DNA transplants.So-called ``beauty parlour``.We`d heard rumours of such a place.I didn`t think it really existed.It doesn`t any more.Zao got away.But he left these behind.All from Gustav Graves`s mine.I think it`s a front for launderingAfrican conflict diamonds.We need to tread carefully.Graves is politically connected.- Lucky I`m on the outside, then.- It seems you`ve become useful again.Then maybe it`s timeyou let me get on with my job.Forgive my mentioning it, 007,but a perfect marksman isn`t reallysupposed to shoot his own boss.Check the replay.You`ll find he`s deadand she`s only got a flesh wound.There`s always an excuse,isn`t there, Double-O Zero?Give me the old firing range any day,Quartermaster.Yes, but it`s called the future,so get used to it.So, this is where they keepthe old relics then, eh?I`ll have you know this is where our mostcutting-edge technology is developed.- Point taken.- Must you touch everything?Does this still work?- Now, look...- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?I`m trying to get to it.Weapon, please.One pane unbreakable glass,one standard-issue ring finger.Twist so, et voil.Ultra high-frequency,single-digit, sonic agitator unit.You`re cleverer than you look.Better than looking cleverer than you are.Follow me, please.- Now, a new watch. Your 20th, I believe.- How time flies.Yes, well, 007, why don`t you establisha record by actually returning this one?Your new transportation.You`ve been down here too long.- The ultimate in British engineering.- You must be joking.As I learnt from my predecessor, Bond,I never joke about my work.Aston Martin call it the Vanquish.We call it the Vanish.- Oh, very good.- Adaptive camouflage.Tiny cameras on all sidesproject the image they seeonto a light-emitting polymer skinon the opposite side.To the casual eye,it`s as good as invisible.Plus the usual refinements:ejector seat, torpedoes,target-seeking shotgunsto shoot down mobile objects.Acquaint yourself with the manual. Shouldbe able to shoot through it in two hours.Just took a few seconds, Q.Wish I could make you vanish.Come in.Before you leaveon your mission for Iceland,tell me what you know of James Bond.He`s a double-O.And a wild one, as I discovered today.He`ll light fuses on any explosive situationand be a danger to himself and others.Kill first, ask questions later.He`s a blunt instrument whose primarymethod is to provoke and confront.A man nobody can get close to.A womaniser.Well, you`re going to be seeinga lot more of him in Iceland.With great respect,a man like him could blow my cover.Miss Frost, you volunteered for this, butin three months you`ve turned up nothing.Graves seems to be clean.Well, Bond thinks differently, so I`m goingto let him do what you so ably described -mix things up a little with Mr Graves.And with you there,things won`t be able to get out of hand.In your three years in Cryptology, you`vekept business and pleasure separate.You haven`t fraternisedwith any of your fellow agents,despite several advances.I think it would be foolish to get involvedwith someone within the community.Especially James Bond.I`m Mr Kil.Well, there`s a name to die for.That`s a new personal best, boss.Thruster two cut out again.Get it fixed, will you?Glad you could make it, Mr Bond.How did you like my run?You looked on the edge of losing control.It`s only by being on the edge that weknow who we really are. Under the skin.Take your Donald Campbell -- Campbell died on his return run.- Yeah, but he died chasing a dream.- Isn`t that the way to go?- I`d rather not go at all.- You don`t chase dreams, you live them.- One of the virtues of never sleeping.I have to live my dreams. Besides,plenty of time to sleep when you`re dead.Mr Bond.- Ah, Miss Frost.- I`ll show you your room.A palace of ice.You must feel right at home.This place was builtfor tonight`s demonstration.The human element necessitatesa precise balance of heat and cold.Built on a lake?I hope Graves got things right.- What`s that property I noticed next door?- The diamond mine.And Gustav`s quarters.Thank you.This is you.Wonderful.Would you like to show me more?Vodka martini.Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.Mojito?James.Here for the penguins this time,or for the view again?Now I`m only interestedin endangered species.- Oh, well, does that include me?- Depends on what you`re up to this time.So I left you in an explosive situation.You`re a big boy who can handle himself.- No wonder your relationships don`t last.- I`m a girl who hates to get tied down.You look terrible.You aren`t looking too good yourself.You are still feeling the side effects?The insomnia is permanent for me.An hour on the Dream Machinekeeps me sane.- What happened to you?- Bond.He knows nothing. I`ve been this closeto him and he still didn`t know who I was.- You saw my father after your exchange?- Yes.General Moon still mourns your death.My death.Mr Bond.- And Miss...?- Swift. Space and Technology magazine.Really? I take it Mr Bond`s beenexplaining his big-bang theory.Oh, yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.I see.Well, the demonstration`s about to beginin five minutes. So shall we?Shall we?Not Jinx any more?Oh, I`ll always be a jinx to you.As you know, I try to give the planetsomething in return for what it`s given me.Those little shards of heavenknown as diamonds.Now, diamonds aren`t just expensivestones. They are the stuff of dreams.And the means to make dreams real.Imagine being able to bring light andwarmth to the darkest parts of the world.Imagine being able to grow cropsthe year round, bringing an end to hunger.Imagine a second sun,shining like a diamond in the sky.Let there be light.I give you Icarus!Icarus is unique. Its miraculoussilver skin will inhale the sun`s lightand breathe it gentlyupon the earth`s surface.You have no idea how much Icarusis about to change your world.And now let us brighten this nightwith our inner radiance.- Vlad, show me the modifications.- Yeah.Here is the self-defence mechanismyou asked me to build in.Armed.- And very dangerous.- Oh, very.M warned me this would happen.Ah. That`s why you tried so hardnot to be interested in me.Oh, God, you`re even worsethan your file says.They don`t look too convinced.Come on. Put your back into it, eh?I know all about you, 007.Sex for dinner, death for breakfast.It won`t work with me.- No?- No.- You`re getting good at this.- Oh, stop it. Are we still being watched?- Oh, they left ages ago.- Oh, God, you`re impossible.Come on, let`s get out of here.You better stay here tonight.Keep up the charade of being lovers.All right.I admire your restraint. You were herea full two hours before anything blew up.The way you`re going,you`ll get us both killed.James, tell me what really happenedin North Korea.I was betrayed. That was all.Occupational hazard.This is crazy. You`re a double-O.It`s only a number.James.Be careful.Go back to your room.I`ll come back for you.Why do you want to kill me?I thought it was the humane thing to do.Who sent you?Your mama. And she told me to tell youshe`s really disappointed in you.I`ll let you in on a little secret.This mine is fake.But the lasers...are real.She won`t talk.Let`s make it permanent.I`ll use the laser.Don`t leave a mess.- Jinx.- James! James! No, no, turn it off! Off!Off!James, I could use a little help here!Switch if off!Or I`m gonna be half the girl I used to be!So, the girl who hatesto be tied down, huh?- Are you gonna get me off this thing?- What are you? CIA?NSA. Hello? We`re on the same side.- Doesn`t mean we`re after the same thing.- Sure it does.World peace, unconditional love, andyour little friend with the expensive acne.- Zao?- Yeah, Zao.He`s back there with someweird psychedelic light mask.Probably brought it from the Cuban clinic.He couldn`t have brought it.It was already here.It belongs to another Korean.His boss.- Kil can give us a hand to get out of here.- I got a better idea.- I`m going to get backup.- Wait.Go to Miranda first. She`s MI6.Warn her to get out.And what are you gonna do?Unfinished business.So you live to die another day...Colonel.At last. I was beginningto think you`d never guess.Was it painful?- The gene therapy?- You couldn`t possibly imagine.Oh, good. I`m glad to hear that.Oh, but there have been compensations.Like watching youflail around in your ignorance.Granting you life day by dayjust to see if you`d get wise. It`s been fun.Well, the fun is aboutto come to a dead end.We only met briefly, you and I.But you left a lasting impression.When your intervention forced meto present the world with a new face,I chose to modelthe disgusting Gustav Graves on you.Oh, just in the details.That unjustifiable swagger.Your crass quips - a defence mechanismconcealing such inadequacy.My defence mechanism is right here.So... Miss Frost isn`t all she seems.Looks can be deceptive.Yes.By the way, did you find outwho betrayed you in North Korea?Only a matter of time.You never thought of lookinginside your own organisation?She was right under your nose.It was so good of youto bring your gun to bed with us.Yes. Occupational hazard.You see, I have a gift.An instinct for sensingpeople`s weaknesses.Yours is women. Hers and mineis winning whatever the cost.So when I arranged for that fataloverdose for the true victor at Sydney,I won myself my very own MI6 agent,using everything at my disposal -her brains, her talent,even her sex.The coldest weapon of all.Hello?Miranda?- There will be others after me, you know.- You mean your American friend Jinx.Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.An ice palace can besuch a treacherous place.Hand over the toys.Oh, yeah.You know, I`ve missedyour sparkling personality.How`s that for a punch line?Kill him.I enjoyed last night, James.But it really is death for breakfast.Kill him quietly.Kill him! Now!- He got away.- No matter.The pleasure of the kill is in the chase.Bring me the generals.Gentlemen,I promised you a demonstration.Now you will see the true power of Icarus.The Western spy runs, but he cannot hide.Icarus will lock onto the heat signatureand concentrate the sun`s power.Hey, boss, he beat your time.Time to draw the line.Global warming is a terrible thing.Yeah, nice moves. Just like Bond.He was pretty vigorous last night as well.He did you?I didn`t know he was that desperate.He won`t come back for you. He just diedrunning, trying to save his own skin.Yeah.That`s pretty good tailoring.I hope it doesn`t shrink when it gets wet.Soon we will be victorious.We`ve got one hour to wrap this up.Let`s move.Come on, Jinx. Where are you?All units report. Now!Warning. Adaptive camouflage failure.Time to give the American her bath.Adaptive camouflage restored.Vlad, does the word ``ergonomics``mean anything to you? Man? Machine?This is still a suitcase.Finish it, will you?Come on. It`s warm in here. Come on.The cold kept you alive, huh?Must have kept you alive. Come on.That`s it.What took you so long?Agent Johnson.- James.- Charles.OK. Bring us up to speed on this.Another division`s been mobilisednorth of the DMZ.- That`s 80,000 troops and counting.- And another million in reserve.Moon`s father won`t let it turn into a war.Moon`s under arrest.Hardliners staged a coup last night.The fact remains you deliberatelymisled me by implicating Bond.- If you`d told us of your agent in Cuba...- She`d be dead, betrayed by your mole.We wouldn`t have had a moleif you`d told us Miss Frost and Moonwere on the Harvardfencing team together.Knowing who to trustis everything in this business.Well, well. James Bond.- Just in time for the fireworks.- Let`s get down to business.We`re at DEFCON 2.And if the North goes South,they`re gonna go south big time.You don`t just stroll throughthe world`s biggest minefield.You need some kind of an edge. Icarus.We`re taking care of thatwith an ASAT launch in one hour.- Where`s Graves?- In the middle of a North Korean air base.Right where we can`t touch him.You can`t... but I can.Look, we`re here in case things escalate,not to make sure that they do.No incursions into the North.The president gave me a direct order.And when did that ever stop you?You make your own decision.I`m sending in 007.You think I`d leave thisin the hands of the British?You go with him.Approaching drop zone!OK, let`s go!- They`ve entered North Korean airspace.- Relax, Robinson.If our radar can`t see those switchblades,the North Koreans sure as hell can`t.Hey, boss, they launched against Icarus.Leave it on automatic.I hope nobody here is superstitious. Thatis one big mirror we`re about to break.My God.Mobilise the South Korean troops.And get me the president, now!Still no news of Bond?Vehicles.Some big shots.It`s him.- 300 metres.- Windage: one and a half.We`ve gotta get on that plane.You. Have my father brought down.Father.I regret our meetinghad to be like this.You can`t tell it`s me?I don`t know you.You`ve always found it difficultto accept me.That made my exile easier to bear,but I never forgot what you taught me.``In war the victorious strategistonly seeks battle.....after the victory has been won.``You see, Father,I remember my Art of War.And this is what guarantees that victory.My son...What have you done to yourself?Come, Father.Watch the rising of your son.The second that hits the 38th parallel,we`ll hit them with everything we got.That may not be enough.Do you see, Father?Icarus is clearing the minefield,creating a highway for our troops.If the Americans don`t run,Icarus will destroy them.Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed.And the West will shake with fear.- America will send nuclear warheads.- Icarus will swat them from the sky.You will destroy us.You would kill your own son?The son I knew died long ago.Father, you disappoint me.Caution. Caution.Manual. Manual.Up! Up!Come on.OK, guys.OK.I got it.My, my. You get around.Let`s see your gun.Uh-uh. Left hand.That`s it.That`s it. Now drop it.Looks like your friends have bailed.Put it on autopilot.Come on.That`s it. Good girl.Drowning you didn`t seem to work. I`llhave to try something more to the point.I can read your every move.Read this.Bitch!Oh, look! Parachutes for the both of us.Whoops. Not any more.You see, Mr Bond,you can`t kill my dreams.But my dreams can kill you.Time to face destiny.Time to face gravity.I think I broke her heart.Looks like we`re going down together.Not yet.- Get the back open!- OK!Come on!- Come on. Come on.- I told you I was a jinx.I should have warned you.My relationships don`t last either.- At least we`re gonna die rich.- Huh?Come on. Come on, come on.Come on. Come on.Now...you said something aboutgoing down together?James.Moneypenny.Oh, James.Moneypenny?I was... just testing it out.It`s rather hard, isn`t it?Yes. Very.Wait. Don`t pull it out.I`m not finished with it yet.See? It`s a perfect fit.- Leave it in.- Well, it`s gotta come out sooner or later.No, leave it in, please.A few more minutes.We really have to get these back.Still the good guys, huh?I`m still not quite sure...how good you are.I am so good.Especially when you`re bad.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=die-another-day',\n",

I rather liked Baines.We shared the same boot maker.Coffee,sir?I take it these killings are connected?That\\'s preciselywhat you\\'re going to find out.Baines was working on a smallCaribbean island called San Monique.Dawes was in New York,keeping an eye on its prime minister,one Dr Kananga.Hamilton was on loan to the Americansin New Orleans.Is that all it does?By the way, congratulations.The ltalians were most impressedby the way you handled the Rome affair.Thank you, sir.Sugar?Thanks.The authoritieswere more than helpful.There\\'s one small complaint.They seem to be missingone of their agents.A Miss... Caruso.You wouldn\\'t happen to knowwhere she is?Miss Moneypenny.- Morning, Moneypenny.- Good morning, sir.- It\\'s only the hour that\\'s indecent.- Really?I\\'ve got your ticket to New York.Q has repaired your wristwatch.- And some background on San Monique.- Thank you, Moneypenny.I\\'m sure the overburdened Britishtaxpayer will be fascinated to knowwill how the Special Ordnance Sectiondisburses its funds.In future, Commander, may I suggesta perfectly adequate watchmakerjust down the street.Good God!Pulling out this button turns the watchinto a hyper-intensified magnetic field,powerful enough to deflectthe path of a bullet- at long range - or so Q claims.- I feel tempted to test that theory now.If you don\\'t mind, Commander, my spoon.Sorry, sir.Thank you.Dr Kananga is at present in New York.The CIA have been informed.They are helping with surveillance.Your flight arrives at 1 1 .30am.Now, where did I leave my coat?Allow me.Thank you.Come along, Miss Moneypenny.- Morning, Bond.- Sir.Miss Moneypenny.Thank you.Goodbye, James.Or should I say... ciao, bello?Such a delicate touch.Sheer magnetism, darling.A man comes.He travels quickly.He has purpose.He comes over water.He travels with others.He will oppose.He brings violence and destruction.Hello.- Mr Leiter for you, sir.- Thank you.Hello, Felix. How are you?Traffic permitting,I should be with you in halfan hour.Then you can buy methe best lunch in New York.Hi, James. Your friend Kanangahas just left the UN.He\\'s probably headed backto his embassy.No, don\\'t worry. The place is eyeballed,wired for sound - the works.Right. I\\'ll see you in a half-hour.Easy, Charlie.Let\\'s get there in one piece.Charlie?Right, stand by.Here comes Kananga\\'s limousine.Out he getswith the usual goon squadand the girl.Time: 1 1 .46.What is that?!Felix?

Nelson David George.It would seem, Dr Kananga,that the conference has notIived up to your expectations.We can only hope thatthis is a temporary setback.However, I do havesome observations to make.Take a letter, please.To Secretary-General,Pan-lsland Unity Conference.Sir...I wish to point out...that...too manyof our island neighbourshave once again let themselves be...bullied by United States industry.The story is an old one,the record a clear one.Since my historic statement ofprincipleswas delivered and acted uponsome six months ago,our economic outlookhas improved dramatically.By exercising our policy of friendshipto all with favouritism towards none,new respect for the entire areahas been injected.And even though some ofmy...James? That car is registeredto a shop at 33 East 65th Street.That\\'s only a block away from here.Right.

D\\'you hear?Is he armed?You can\\'t be too careful in New York City.Funny how the least little thingamuses him.Fascinating.That\\'s you, quite obviously.An amazing resemblance.Am I in there as well?Pick a card.Turn it over.You have found yourself.I\\'m telling you,go out to LA and clean it upor I\\'m coming out thereand clean you up. And I mean that!Is this the stupid motherthat tailed you uptown?There seems to be some mistake.My name...Names is for tombstones, baby.Y\\'all take this honky outand waste him - now!- \"Waste him\"? ls that a good thing?- The reading is over.Nothing about my future?Us?Now, promise you\\'ll stay right there.I shan\\'t be long.Thank you.Keep your hands up, honky.What\\'s he think this is?Blow his friggin\\' head off.Drop it!Now.Harold Strutter, CIA.

Every one.You were nailed the minute you left 74.Only one man can pull togetherthat much black muscle in this town.Calls himself Mr Big.You name the business.They say he has a black concession.What would a foreign prime ministerlike Kanangawant with an American gangster?Question is, what would Mr Bigwant with a two-bit island diplomat?Mr Big?

Thank you.- Here you are.- Thank you.Mrs Bond, I presume?I\\'m Rosie Carver.I guess I have a little explaining to do.Yes. Either you ordear Uncle Felix.Custom 38, Smith & Wesson.Corrugated three-inch stock,no serial number, standard CIA issue.The question is: why point it at me?The man who delivered your champagneis not a hotel waiter.I was just trying to be careful.As for Felix Leiter, you\\'re right.I\\'ve worked for CIA down herefor some time now.He cabled me you were comingand asked if I would help out if I could.Perhaps you\\'d better startby getting your head together.- There\\'s a mirror in the bathroom.- Yes.You\\'re only my second mission,you know.My first was Baines.The agent who was killed.It\\'s a relief to know I\\'m next in linefor the same kind of aid.- There\\'s a...- A snake! I should have told you.You should never go in therewithout a mongoose.I should have nevergotten into any of this!I\\'m going to be completely useless to you.I\\'m sure we\\'ll be ableto lick you into shape.It\\'s... getting late, Mrs Bond.Tomorrow will be a very busy day.You see, Kananga isprotecting something down here.Something which Bainesobviously discovered.You\\'re going to show me the spotwhere Baines\\' body was found.That, I\\'m afraid,only leaves us tonight to...catch up on old times.Felix told me there\\'d bemoments like this.What did good old Felix suggest?If all else failed,cyanide pills.I settled for two bedrooms.Good night, Mr Bond.Mrs Bond.It\\'s just a hat, darling,belonging to a small-headed manwho lost a fight with a chicken.It\\'s a warning. Get it outta here!Oh, please!Please don\\'t leave me alone tonight.James, please promise me!All right, darling,if you insist... I promise.Thank you.Rosie!Breakfast\\'s up!Rosie!- Are you ready yet?- What?I have to see about organising a car.I\\'ll see you in the lobby.Over here, sir!Guarantee big fish. Catch big fish, sir!Hey, baby! Over here!Bring your man over here!Just $20! Have a date!You got warm lady?We got cold beer over here, man.You wanna catch a big fish, sir?It\\'s only 2 over here.Good morning.Come on, Rosie.This one seems eager enough.Excuse me!Where can I change?Me... clothes off... where?Stop right there.Turn around slowly.Keep your hands up!As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent.But the compensationsspeak for themselves.Rosie Carver, meet the manwho shares my hairbrush.Quarrel Junior.I\\'m really sorry. I could have shot you.You might have even killed meif you\\'d taken off the safety catch.Never mind, darling.You just let us know when we getto the spot where Baines was killed.It\\'s up in the hills,just after we clear the next cove.Hey, Quarrel!Who the hell lives up there?That\\'s the house of the Kananga woman.She\\'s supposed to havethe power of the obeah.No one on the islanddare go up there except him.He comes again.There will be violence.He approaches even now.By land or water?Water.He has arrived.Good.Rosie\\'s been more efficientthan I anticipated.I know wherewe could rustle up a car.Beautiful, brave, and now resourceful.Rosie, you seem to be staginga remarkable comeback.Tell me about the future.Is it death?I said, is it death?It is death.They\\'re coming.Rosie knows what to do.Now, I want no bodies this time. No trace.It\\'s down there.But... I thought you saidBaines was killed up in the hills, darling.Up in the hills, down there.Why don\\'t we have a bite of lunchand discuss it?There\\'s an excellent pt in the hamper.I\\'m in no hurry.Are you?No.James!You don\\'t knowwhat finding you has meant to me.I can imagine.And you\\'ve no ideawhat finding this has meant to me.You do know what the Queen of Cupsmeans in an upside-down position?A deceitful, perverse woman.A liar, a cheat.And I\\'d like some answers now.Please...You don\\'t understand, sir.They\\'ll kill me if I do.And I\\'ll kill you if you don\\'t.But you couldn\\'t. You wouldn\\'t.Not after what we\\'ve just done.I certainly wouldn\\'thave killed you before.It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.It\\'s wearing a little thin now.It\\'s not an act. It\\'s...Make your choice.Rosie!You will explain what went wrong.I see the intervention of a woman.The girl was about to confess.We had to kill her.The trap was set.Tee Hee was waiting.And you saw death.It must have been the girl\\'s death.If you do not ask specific questions,I cannot be responsible for yourmisinterpretation of the answers.These growing signs of impertinencebegin to disturb me, Solitaire.As they did with your mother before you.She had the power and lost it.Became useless to me.You will not make the same mistake,Solitaire.Where is Bond now?Where is Bond now?!I cannot seewhen you are this way with me.Things become unclear.Let us hope these momentary lapsesdo not become a habit.Your power exists to serve me.And it is mine to control.If and when the time comes I decide youare to lose it, I myself will take it away.Solitaire, go to sleep. You have made meangry with you, and I have no wish to be.Tee Hee...Put down those cards!It is a blasphemy!They tell nothingto those who cannot see.But they do. That\\'s a... a bit of luck.Good luck, for both of us.The cards say we will be lovers.You are mistaken.It\\'s impossible. Forbidden for me.Now you must go.But you do believe,...I mean really believe in the cards?They have never lied to me.Then they won\\'t now.Pick one.You knew the answer before it was given.Strangely enough, somehow,...so did l.So it\\'s finally happened.Just as it did to my mother...and her mother before her.Of course it did.You\\'re visual proof of that, aren\\'t you?Come on, cheer up, darling.There has to be a first time for everyone.Now tell me,where\\'s Kananga?I cannot see.- Oh, yes, the cards. I\\'ll get them.- No!There\\'s no need to be frightened.You\\'ll soon be rid of him, I promise.I promise.I just need aIittle bit of information, that\\'s all.The power...I\\'ve lost it.The High Priestess is wifeto the Prince no longer of this world.The spiritual bridge to the secret church.It was my fate.By compelling me to earthly love,the cards themselveshave taken away my powers.Darling, I\\'ve...a small confession to make.Now, try not to be too upset.The deck was slightly stackedin my favour.It makes no difference.The physical violation cannot be undone.When he finds out I\\'ve lost my power,...he\\'ll kill me.Oh, now, come on.He\\'ll have to find you first.Lovers\\' lesson number one:we have no secrets.For example, I have a boat waiting.You can be on it.All I have to know before we leave is...what goes on back there in voodoo land.Darling, three men and a girlhave been killed in the last four days.Not counting the timesthey\\'ve tried to stop mefrom discoveringwhat Kananga\\'s protecting.Now, do you want to beon that boat or not?I simply read the cards for him.I have never been there,and he\\'s never taken me there.I\\'ve never dared to go.But I\\'ve looked in the cards.I\\'ve seen great riches there.They\\'ll kill you.Us, darling.They will kill us.Lovers\\' lesson number two: togetherness.Till death do us part, or thereabouts.Is there time before we leavefor lesson number three?Absolutely.There\\'s no sense in going off half-cocked.- This way.- How can you be so sure?These scarecrows are to scarepeople away. You\\'re not scared, are you?Lesson number four:follow the scarecrows.- Good morning, boss.- Morning.It\\'s sure gonna be a beautiful day.Yes, sir, a beautiful day!They\\'re heading for the hill.They\\'re here.If he finds it, kill him.Quick!We\\'ve lost him. He has the girl.They\\'re somewhere under the nets.At any cost - any - Bond must die.Unit 2-5. We have picked them up.Base to 2-5. Arrest Bond.But I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.Message received and understood.Over and out.Base to all units.I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.Get out of the way!Sweet mother of pearl!All change! End of the line!Get down below, quickly!Here, I\\'ll do that. You get her started.It appears... a bus.James!He\\'ll be looking for me now.I know he\\'ll never stop.Come on, darling.It\\'s all over.Voodoo land was just poppy fields.A simple matter of heroin smuggling.I\\'ll have a word with a man named Felix,turn the case over to him,and you and I will be off.By the way, where would you like to go?Anywhere where we can findone of these.How quickly can we make itto New Orleans?Santa Mina, four hours away...You could catch a flightand be there in the morning.Get in touch with Felix. Tell him to meetme there tomorrow. Royal Orleans Hotel.Tampa is closer.Hamilton was killed in New Orleans,so there has to be a connection.And this is a valuable pieceof merchandise we\\'re carrying.Which, with any luck, they\\'ll want back.Royal Orleans Hotel, please.Are you sure this is the wayto New Orleans?I don\\'t know, but this surebeats the hell out of Harlem, don\\'t it?Well, hello, Jim!What\\'s happenin\\', baby?Just ease back now, Jim. Relax!Mr Big wants to see you.You made a mistakeback on that island, Bond.You took something that didn\\'t belongto you, from a friend of Mr Big\\'s.That type of mistakeis tough to bounce back from.- But I\\'ve only just arrived.- Today is your lucky day, Jim!You\\'re going skydiving!There\\'s a helluva view of the lakefrom 10,000 feet.My only regret is I won\\'t be there to see it.Let\\'s go!- Good morning. You\\'re...- Mrs Bell.You\\'re not my instructor.Where\\'s Mr Bleeker?Indisposed. I\\'ll be giving the lesson.What\\'s on for today?Let\\'s just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?You\\'re over-revving.- Leroy, slow down, for Pete\\'s sake!- Do what the man say!I can\\'t... I can\\'t find the brake!Close those doors!Holy shit!OK, Don. Don\\'t worry,I\\'ll take care of it. Right.Talk to you later.I\\'ve got to go and give a lesson.Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?Yes, Mr Bleeker.Yes, sir. I know you just can\\'tglue the wings back on.Now, Mr Bleeker, I\\'m surethere\\'s no reason for name-calling.That\\'s fine. Don\\'t forget the double vents.I appreciate she\\'s one of your best pupils.That\\'s a little frantic.I\\'ll keep the other three.Any such suggestionshould be put in writing to Washington.- How is Mrs Bell?- Intensive care, but she\\'ll pull through.Yes, sir.No one\\'s questioning your patriotism.I\\'m sure you\\'re a veteran, sir.Felix, find out if there\\'sa Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.We\\'re way ahead of you. It\\'s onDocker Street. Strutter\\'s watching it now.Hell of a send-off.This way.- Where\\'s Strutter?- He\\'s gotta be inside somewhere.Two, gentlemen?I got a nice booth over here,just against the wall.Do you think you could find somethinga little closer to the stage?- What\\'s wrong with a booth?- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.- Bourbon. No ice, please.- Two Sazeracs.Where\\'s your sense of adventure?This is New Orleans. Relax!- One of you Felix Leiter?- Yeah, right here.- Call for you. A guy called Strutter.- Thanks.For a minute, I thought Harrywas laying down on a job.What happened to my...- What happened to my friend?- What happened? Listen.Thanks for droppin\\' in, baby.Yeah, you\\'re one tough pig to nail down.You\\'ve been picking at melike some kind of maggot.First, you go up to Harlemand kill one of the brothers.And that disturbed me.And then you go and stealthis valuable young ladyfrom my good friend, Dr Kananga.Now, old Kananga, he believesin all that card crap.I mean, he\\'s mad.Well, possession beingnine points of the law,I would say Kanangais your problem now.Thank you.In fact, if I were you,I\\'d... watch my step from now on.Yeah, well, you just let me handleour business with the man.I got my own plans for you, baby.But firstthere\\'s one little questionthat he wants answers for.Then you\\'d better ship me backto the island and let him ask in person.I\\'m not in the habitof giving answers to lackeys.You damn lucky you got an ear leftto hear the question with.Which is... did you mess with that?That\\'s between Solitaire and myself...and Kananga. I\\'ll tell him when I see him.You won\\'t see sunlightunless you answer!I\\'d no idea you were so frightened of him.Did you touch her?!When I see Kananga.Right.Quite revealing.Kananga: poppy growerin thousands of acresof well-camouflaged fields,protected by the voodoo threatof Baron Samedi.Then there\\'s Mr Big,distributor and wholesaler througha chain of Fillet Of Soul restaurants.Wholesale?Sell heroin, for money?!My apologies. I\\'m sureyou simply give it away.Excellent, Mr Bond.That\\'s precisely what I intend to do.Two tons of it, to be exact.When entering intoa fiercely competitive field,one finds it advisableto give away free samples.Man or woman, black or white.I don\\'t discriminate.Two tons of heroin with a street valuewell over a billion dollarsnationally distributed free?That should make a certain group offamilies rather angry, wouldn\\'t you say?Angry?Why, my dear Mr Bond,it\\'ll positively drive themout of their minds.- And subsequently out of the business.- Quite ingenious.A sort of junkies\\' welfare system.Merely until the number of addictsin the country has doubled, shall we say?Then I will market that acreageyou blundered into the other day.That heroin will be very expensive indeed,leaving myself and the phone companythe only two going monopoliesin this nation for years to come.And here I thought it was Solitairewho did the fortune-telling.Let\\'s hope for both your sakesshe still can.The question still stands, Mr Bond.Asked by the gentleman concerned.Did you touch her?Well, it\\'s not the sort of question...a gentleman answers.Well, having set the example,I don\\'t expect Miss Solitaireto be any less the lady.By the way,that\\'s a particularly handsome watchyou\\'re wearing, Mr Bond.- May I see it, please?- You\\'ll forgive me if I don\\'t get up.Butterhook!Tee Hee.On the first wrong answerfrom Miss Solitaire,you will snip the little fingerof Mr Bond\\'s right hand.Starting with the second wrong answer,you will proceedto the more... vital areas.Solitaire,my dear,I want you to listen to me very carefully.On the back of Mr Bond\\'s watchthe registration number: 3-2-6-Do I speak the truth?You speak the truth.Well,...if nothing else,at least I\\'ve laid your fears to rest.My compliments on a splendid operation.There is one thing, however, the...Whisper.Take him to the farm.When do we start back?Soon, Solitaire.Soon.Solitaire, why?I treated you well. You lacked for nothing.I don\\'t understand what you...Mr Bond\\'s watch, my dear.I gave you every break possible.You had a 50-50 chance.You weren\\'t even close.I had no choice.Please believe me... The cards!When the time came, I myselfwould have given you love.You knew that.You knew that!There\\'s only one proper wayto deal with this.And one proper time.The tonnage order is nearly complete.We move it out tonight.And I mean tonight!Mr Bond.How much do you knowabout crocodiles, Bond?I\\'ve... always triedto keep them at arm\\'s length myself.Cute little nippers, ain\\'t they?I don\\'t suppose those potentialovernight bags are orphans.Oh, no! We havesome moms and dads as well.In fact, quite a few thousand.This is the part I like best: feeding time.I suspect, the highlight of the tour.Some of these babieslive to be 200 years old.Look over there.That\\'s an alligator.You can always tell by its round nose.There\\'s old Albert.He\\'s a croc.Got careless with him some time back,and he took my whole arm off.Well done, Albert!They\\'ll eat anything. Even each other.Then again, sometime they can goa whole year without eating.I was rather counting on that.There are two waysto disable a crocodile, you know.I... don\\'t suppose you\\'d careto share that information with me?One way is to jam a pencilinto the depression hole behind his eyes.And the other?The other\\'s twice as simple.You just put your hand in his mouthand pull his teeth out.Fire!Evans, get him!Adam, in the car!

So just answer his question.Well, in theory, if you could alterthe timing chip......you could slowlysend a ship off course.Like putting a magnetnear a compass.Yeah, exactly.- Then check this out.- Oh, yeah.Those two circles should belining up on top of each other.Somebody\\'s tamperedwith your encoder.If we knew the last time and positionthe Devonshire thought she was......could you figure outexactly where she sank?Sure.- Wade?- Yeah?I have a small favor to ask.The high-altitude,low-opening jump, the HALO jump......is where we get the most fatalities,so listen up.You free-fall for 5 miles and use youroxygen, or you\\'ll die of asphyxiation.Sounds like my first marriage.Next, after the free-fall......pop the chute at 200 feet,below the Chinese radar.You\\'ll be travelingat over 200 miles an hour.This snaps your head backlike a cantaloupe.Don\\'t crack your skull openon the tanks.I\\'ll keep that in mind.One last thing: When you hit the water,don\\'t forget to cut away your chute.Ninety percent of peoplekilled in HALO jumps......got tangled up in their chutesand drowned. Got it?Seems like a lotjust to save the world.I\\'ve got no choice.I have to prove that shipwas deliberately sent off course.- One minute!- Is the pickup set?You bet. After your mission,turn on your beacon.The extraction teamwill pick you up after dark.Buddha bless!- I just noticed something.- Yeah?This is where the shipthought it was.This is where it really is.But see that island?- Yeah.- That means where he\\'s jumping......between the Britishand Chinese fleets...Technically they\\'re notin Chinese territorial waters.- They belong to Vietnam.- Vietnam?Does he have anyU.S. government markings on him?The parachute,the wet suit, the fins.If the Vietnamese catch him,they\\'re gonna go crazy.He didn\\'t even say goodbye.Still interested in hostile takeovers?It\\'s the opportunities for travelthat I like best about banking.Get them out of the water.If I didn\\'t know better, I\\'d say youwere following me around, Mr. Bond.You\\'ll have to admit, though......we seem to have developeda certain attachment to each other.Hopefully not for long.Another Carver building.If I didn\\'t know better, I\\'d sayhe\\'d developed an edifice complex.General Chang?Friend of yours?Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.Welcome to Saigon.It\\'s always nice to see you, Elliot.I hadn\\'t intended openingthis center until tomorrow......but as you\\'re here you can help mewrite the inaugural story:Your obituaries.I hope you extendedthe same courtesy to Paris.Actually, Mr. Bond, you\\'re the onewho wrote my late wife\\'s obituary......when you asked her to betray me.Still, let\\'s see.\"British secret service agentJames Bond......and his collaborator Wai Lin......of the Chinese People\\'sExternal Security Force......were found......dead this morning......in Vietnam.Lacks punch, don\\'t you think?It\\'s old news, Elliot.We\\'ve been working togetherfor months.Both our governments know what youand General Chang are up to.I don\\'t think so.You may have seen the generalin the hallway just now......but perhaps,with all your jetting around......you\\'ve not had chance to perusetoday\\'s headlines.I rather like the last one.It isn\\'t even mine.I never believe what I readin the press anyway.Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.You see, we\\'re both men of action,but your era and Miss Lin\\'s is passing.Words are the new weapons,satellites the new artillery.And you become the newsupreme allied commander?Exactly!Caesar had his legions,Napoleon had his armies......I have my divisions.TV, news, magazines.And by midnight I\\'ll have reachedand influenced more people......than anyone in the historyof this planet, save God Himself.And the best he ever managedwas the Sermon on the Mount.You really are quite insane.The distancebetween insanity and genius......is measured only by success.Excuse me.- General Chang is waiting.- lf you\\'ll forgive me...Your appearance here has forced meto move up my timetable slightly.I\\'ll leave you in the capable handsof Mr. Stamper and his toys.Perhaps you\\'d like to see them.- Sir. The helicopter.- Thanks, Gupta.Mr. Stamper is a protgof the late Dr. Kaufman......who was schooling him inthe ancient art of chakra torture.He was like a father to me.Really? Interesting role model.According to Eastern philosophy,the body has seven chakra points.Energy centers,like the heart or genitals.The purpose of these implementsis to probe those organs......inflicting the maximum amountof pain......whilst keeping the victim alivefor as long as possible.Dr. Kaufman\\'s recordwas 52 hours.I\\'m hoping to break it.I would\\'ve thought watchingyour TV shows was torture enough.Save this one till last.When you remove Mr. Bond\\'s heart......there should just be enough timefor him to watch it stop beating.Excuse me.Go! Go! Go! Go!We can use the banner.Hope it holds.- Get after them!- Ready? Go!Next time I\\'ll take the elevator.Push! Push!- Get a car!- No, no!- Yes, a car!- A bike is quicker.The keys.Someone always forgets them.What are you doing?I\\'m driving. Get off.Get on the back.I\\'m slipping.Stop fidgeting back there.What are you...?Give me that.Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!- Turn right.- No, left.Who\\'s driving? Come on!Clutch!Left! Left!How many back there?I can\\'t see. Hold on.What are you...? What?- Don\\'t get any ideas.- I\\'d never dream of it.One. No, two.- Go for the barrels.- What?Very good.Hold on!Let\\'s take the highway.- Helicopter!- All right, keep your shirt on.- Get on the back of the bike.- Are you trying to protect me?No. I need to balance the bike.Get on the back.- You ready?- Yeah.Go!Pop the clutch.- It\\'s behind us.- Move!Get out of the way!You see the chopper?I can\\'t see. Hold on.What are you...?Trapped.Never.Would you pass the soap?Over there.You were pretty goodwith that hook.It comes from growing upin a rough neighborhood.You were pretty goodon the bike.Well, that comes fromnot growing up at all.Here. Allow me.Don\\'t get any ideas, Mr. Bond.Just off the cuff,I thought we might link up.Work hand in hand?Stick closer to each other.Maybe we go afterGeneral Chang together.Your turn.Thanks for washing my hair.I work alone.Lucky for you I stopped by.I could\\'ve taken care of him.But you didn\\'t.Give me the earring.Copy of a Makarov 59.Standard issue, Chinese army.Looks like General Changwants you dead.You still thinkyou can do this alone?It depends whether your missionis peace or revenge.This is about stopping a war.Last year we foundstealth material was missing......from one ofGeneral Chang\\'s bases.I followed a leadto Carver\\'s headquarters in Hamburg.Stealth material?We thought he was buildinga stealth plane.No. Stealth boat.That\\'s the only way they couldget close to the Devonshire,,,...so they could drill insidethe missile room.Remember? They stolea cruise missile from that ship.He said he was moving the timetableforward to midnight.Yes, of course he did.Under cover of darknesshe\\'ll position the stealth boat......near the British fleet......fire the missile into China.- And we will retaliate.- And Carver will provide the pictures.- I have to warn Beijing.- No.Let\\'s warn both our governments,get them talking.It\\'ll give us time to find the boat.Stand up.It\\'s just like home.You get the equipment,I\\'ll send the messages.On second thought, you type.First we have to find the boat.Of all the harbors and inletscontrolled by General Chang......22 are inhighly populated areas.That leaves 14where he could hide a stealth boat.You can see it during the day.It\\'s invisible to radar,but not the human eye.Very novel.He\\'d have to hide itsomeplace where......he could sail to the Devonshireand back in one night.This looks familiar.- We\\'ve made some improvements.- Have you, indeed?Okay. Four hours outand four hours back.Assume the boat is travelingat a speed of 30 knots.I\\'ve always been a fanof Chinese technology.According to this......there are four placeswhere he could harbor the boat.Up on your left.Run a cross-check on those areasfor anything suspicious.Ah, the new Walther.I asked Q to get me one of these.I\\'ve got it. Look.Four missing boats.Three unexplained drownings.That has to be it.Ha Long Bay.He knows the island.He says that it\\'s dangerous forboats to be around there at sunset......but for 5000 American dollars......he\\'ll take us.- Good.Maybe he\\'ll take a check.It\\'s mostly dull routine,of course......but every now and then you get tosail on a beautiful evening like this......and sometimes work with a decadentagent of a corrupt Western power.And they say Communistsdon\\'t know how to have fun.I hate to disappoint you......but I don\\'t even havea little red book.If anything happens to me......the fuses for the minesare in here.We\\'re gonna finish this together.And if I may say so,you found the right......decadent, corrupt Western agent......as a partner.- See the stealth?- No.It\\'s getting lateand this is the last cove in the bay.Yeah, that\\'s it.Set the timers for 10 minutes.That\\'ll give us time to get out ofhere before the ship explodes.Even if it doesn\\'t sink,it\\'ll show up on radar.- Our fleets will finish the job.- lf they got our message.- Okay, you, up and over.- Okay.We\\'re in positionbetween the fleets,Fire one missileat the flagship of each fleet.The Chinese will think the Britishare rattling the saber......the British will think the Chineseare being belligerent......and the media will providecool, objective coverage.Let the mayhem begin.Missile lock-on.Send a signal to the Admiralty:\"Task group under missile attack.\"Sir, AWACS reports two wavesof land-based MiG 21 s inbound.The first group should beon our screens in two minutes.How long before the MiGs are withinfiring range of the British fleet?Twelve minutes.What the hell do I pay you for?If she\\'s there, Bond is there.Stamper, find them.Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!If she blinks, kill her.You come with me.Stamper to Bridge, Bond is dead,Delicious.Make sure you clear all the mines,and bring the girl up to me.Are you sure you want her up here?It\\'s my business, Mr. Gupta.I like an audience.Ah, Miss Lin.Your countrymen are beingso cooperative......so predictably eagerto save face.My government knows you\\'reout here. They\\'re looking for you.Not according to our radar......where it seems your MiGs areabout to attack the British fleet......in how many minutes?Nine minutes to firing range.And even if they werelooking for me......we\\'re on a stealth boat.They can\\'t see me, or you......or even your friend......the late Commander Bond......who is at this moment on his wayto the bottom of the South China Sea.He\\'s my new anchorman.Pathetic.What on earth\\'s going on?A message from 007......just confirmed bymy opposite number in China.\"Tell the fleet to search for a shipthat\\'s almost invisible to radar.\"The Chinese aren\\'t the enemy.Carver\\'s been playingboth sides for fools.Admiral, sir,urgent message from the Admiralty.Look at this.Anything on radar that looks small?Lifeboat, periscope, anything?- No, sir.- Stealth boat, sir? They\\'ve gone mad.What you\\'re about to witness, MissLin, is not so much a missile attack......but the launchof a new world order.In five minutes, after your countrymenhave attacked the British fleet...I shall retaliatefor dear old England......by sending this missileinto Beijing......where General Chang has justcalled an emergency meeting......of the Chinese high command.Unfortunately......General Changwill be delayed in traffic......arriving just after the missilehas killed your leaders......and too late to stop the air forcefrom sinking the entire British fleet.But he\\'ll be just in time to take overthe government, negotiate a truce......and emerge as a world leader......with the Nobel Peace Prize.- And what do you get?- Me?Oh, nothing.Just exclusive broadcasting rightsin China for the next hundred years.Ready to rock and ruin.If you\\'ll excuse me, my dear,I have a deadline to meet.Prepare for the missile launch.Mr. Gupta.Hello, Elliot.Interesting plan.But I think I havesomething that belongs to you,So much for German efficiency.Mr. Stamper.- Don\\'t shoot him yet.- Hold your fire.Welcome to my world crisis,Mr. Bond.Even trade, Elliot.Gupta for Wai Lin.You can\\'t fire the missilewithout him.And it seems you can\\'t resistany woman in my possession.What are you waiting for?Shoot him!I told you we\\'re going tofinish this together.How romantic.Do you realizehow absurd your position is?No more absurd thanstarting a war for ratings.Great men have always manipulatedthe media to save the world.Look at William Randolph Hearst,who told his photographers:\"You provide the pictures,I\\'ll provide the war.\"I\\'ve just taken it one step further.Sorry about that.I tuned out therefor a moment, Elliot.Touch.Mr. Gupta......is the missile ready to fire?Press the magic button,Beijing disappears.Then it seemsyou\\'ve outlived your contract.You see, Mr. Bond,I have a backup plan.So do I.He\\'s breached the hull.They\\'ll see us on radar.Sir, we have a small,intermittent contact on the surface.Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.It\\'s a very weak signal, but I\\'d swearit wasn\\'t there a second ago, sir.Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on theChinese for any reason whatsoever.Send the messageto the Chinese fleet commander:\"Have sighted unknown ship...\"Get those fires out!Get down thereand protect the missile.Oh, and Mr. Stamper,would you please kill those bastards?Nice work.They\\'re speeding up.- We have to stop the boat.- Can you take care of the engine room?- Of course.- Good. Do it and get off the ship.I\\'m going to stop the missile.Signal fromthe Chinese fleet commander.\"To Royal Navy Task Group:We also have the unknown shipon our screens.We will not fireunless it turns towards China.Until then, she\\'s yours.Good hunting.\"Now, captain, whateverthe hell that thing is, sink it.Right, sir.

Because if I want sarcasm,Mr. Tanner, I'll talk to my children.- Good evening, 007.- Good evening, M.The Prime Minister'swaiting for an update.Proceed with your briefing,Mr. Tanner.Thank you.After the distress signal,your helicopter took off...and the Russians scrambledthese three MIGs here to intercept it.What do you think the Russiansare using the base for?Well, at one point we suspectedSevernaya might be the ground station...for a secret space-based weapons programcalled GoldenEye, but...Our statistical analysissaw they had...neither the financenor technology to implement it.Numbers were nevermy strong suit.Are these pictures live?Unlike the American government, weprefer not to get our bad news from CNN.Negative so far.Everything seems normal.What the bloody hell was that?Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!Boris!Boris!Thanks.Our satellite is knocked out.So are two of the Americans.We have anothercoming into range...now.Good God.Two of the MIGs are down.And it looks likethe third went into the dish.What do you think?No lights.Not one single electric light onin a 30-mile radius.E.M.P.?- That explains the MIGs and satellites.- And the blackout.Electromagnetic Pulse:a first-strike satellite weapondeveloped by the...The Americans and Sovietsduring the Cold War.I've read the brief.Discovered after Hiroshima.Set off a nuclear devicein the upper atmosphere.Creates a pulse...a radiation surge that destroyseverything with an electronic circuit.The idea being to knock outthe enemy's communications...before he, she, or theycould retaliate.So, GoldenEye exists.Yes.- Could this be an accident?- No.The helicopter.If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye,it was the perfect getaway vehicle.Setting off the blast was the ideal wayto wipe out any trace of the crime.The Janus group?It may have been involvedwith the helicopter.I know the Russianfailsafe systems.You don't just walk inand ask for the keys to the bomb.You need the access codes.It had to be an insider.And at least one personprobably knows who it is.Very well, sir.Thank you. Good night.The Prime Minister'stalked to Moscow.They're saying it was an accidentduring a routine training exercise.Governments change.The lies stay the same.What else do we know aboutthe Janus syndicate?Topflight arms dealers,headquartered in St. Petersburg.The first outfit to restockthe Iraqis during the Gulf War.The head man's unreliably described.No photographs.The woman, Onatopp...is our only confirmed contact.- Would you care for a drink?- Thank you.- Your predecessor kept cognac in the...- I prefer bourbon.- Ice?- Yes.We've pulled the files onanyone who might have had access...or authority at Severnaya.The top name on the list isan old friend of yours, I understand.Ourumov.They made him a General.He sees himself asthe next Iron Man of Russia.So our political analysts rule him out.He doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.Are these the same analystswho said that GoldenEye couldn't exist?Who said the helicopterposed no immediate threat...and wasn't worth following?You don't like me, Bond.You don't like my methods.You think I'm an accountant...a 'bean counter, ' more interestedin my numbers than your instincts.- The thought had occurred to me.- Good.Because I think you're a sexist,misogynist dinosaur.A relic of the Cold War...whose boyish charms,though wasted on me, obviously appeal...to that young womanI sent out to evaluate you.- Point taken.- Not quite, 007.If you think for one moment I don't havethe balls to send a man out to die...your instincts are dead wrong.I've no compunction aboutsending you to your death.But I won't do it on a whim, even withyour cavalier attitude towards life.I want you to find GoldenEye.Find who took it, what they planto do with it, and stop it.And if you should come across Ourumov,guilty or not...I don't want you running offon some kind of vendetta.Avenging Alec Trevelyanwill not bring him back.- You didn't get him killed.- Neither did you.Don't make it personal.Never.Bond.Come back alive.Good morning, General Ourumov.Defense Minister Mishkin,gentlemen.Please deliver your report.As this Council is aware,a secret weapon system code-namedGoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya.As head of Space Division...I personally undertookthe investigation.I have concluded this crimewas committed by Siberian separatists...seeking to createpolitical unrest.Regrettably,the peaceful work...and much-needed hard currencyearnings of Severnaya...have been set backby several years.Therefore,I tender my resignation.It seems the Council does notwant your head, Arkady Grigorovich.Merely your Ioyal assurance thatthere are no other GoldenEye satellites.I can give you that assurance,Defense Minister.And what of the two missingSevernaya technicians?I was aware only of the one,Boris Grishenko.There was a girl alsowhose body was not among the dead.Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova,a level-two programmer.I will investigate immediately,Defense Minister.It would seem presumptuous,General...to blame this incidenton Siberian separatists...before the whereaboutsof your own people are determined.Do you agree?Yes, Defense Minister.Thank you forbringing it to my attention.That will be all.Morning, Q.Sorry about the leg. Skiing?Hunting!Right. Now pay attention, 007.First, your new car, BMW.Agile, five forward gears,all-points radar...self-destruct system...and naturally,all the usual refinements.Now, this I'mparticularly proud of.Behind the headlights,Stinger missiles.Excellent. Just the thing for unwindingafter a rough day at the office.Need I remind you, 007...that you have a licence to kill...not to break the traffic laws.- I wouldn't think of it.- Good.Right. Let's get onto more practical matters.A typical leather belt.Male, size 34, buckle notch.- Have you finished?- Yes.Good.

He finds you.Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.The best thing I can do is point youin the direction of his competition.- Who is the competition?- An ex-KGB guy.A tough mother. Got a limp onhis right leg. Name's Zukovsky.- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?- Yeah.

None that fly.Who's counting?These are not just criminals,Valentin, they're traitors.They used the chopperto steal a nuclear weapon.Killed a lot ofinnocent Russians doing it.- What do you expect from a Cossack?- Who?This Janus, I've never met the man,but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.Group that worked for the Nazisagainst the Russians, Second World War.You know your history, Mr. Bond.At the end of the war...the Lienz Cossacks surrenderedto the British in Austria...believing they'd join your governmentand wage war against the communists.But, the British betrayed them...sent them promptly back to Stalinwho promptly had them all shot...women, children, families.Not exactly our finest hour.Still, ruthless people.They got what they deserved.I want you to set me up with Janus.Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.You're going to meet me tonightat the Grand Hotel Europe.And then, you and I are evenand he owes me one?Precisely.You don't need the gun,Commander.That depends on your definitionof 'safe sex.

Yes!Yes!No, no, no.No more foreplay.Take me to Janus.- This is it?- Yes.Well, I must say,I've had a lovely evening. You?Well, once again,the pleasure was all yours.You'll understandif I don't call.I won't lose sleep over it.Sweet dreams.Hello, James.- Alec?- Back from the dead.No longer just an anonymous staron the memorial wall at Ml6.What's the matter, James?No glib remark?No pithy comeback?Why?Hilarious question,particularly from you.Did you ever ask why?Why we toppled all those dictators,undermined all those regimes?Only to come home: 'Well done, good job.But sorry, old boy.Everything you risked your lifeand limb for has changed. '- It was the job we were chosen for.- Of course you'd say that.James Bond,Her Majesty's Ioyal terrier...defender of theso-called 'faith. 'Oh, please, James, put it away.It's insulting to think I haven'tanticipated your every move.Yes.- I trusted you, Alec.- Trust?What a quaint idea.How did the Ml6 screening missthat your parents were Lienz Cossacks?Once again, your faith is misplaced.They knew.We're both orphans, James.But where your parents had the luxuryof dying in a climbing accident...mine survived the British betrayaland Stalin's execution squads.But my father couldn't let himself,or my mother, live with the shame of it.Ml6 figured I wastoo young to remember.And in one of life'slittle ironies...the son went to work forthe government whose betrayal...caused the fatherto kill himself and his wife.Hence, Janus.The two-faced Roman godcome to life.It wasn't God who gave me this face,it was you...setting the timers for three minutesinstead of six.Am I supposedto feel sorry for you?No. You're supposedto die for me.Oh, by the way...I did think of asking youto join my little scheme...but somehow I knew...never to his friend.Closing time, James.Last call.For England, James.Wake up!Mister!Wake up, please!- Wake up!- I'm here.- I'm here!- Hurry!Hurry up!

It's a lost art.Your sense of humor doesn't slay me,Commander. I'm sorry.- Where is the GoldenEye?- I assumed you had it.I have an English spy, a Severnayaprogrammer and the helicopter they took.That's what some traitor in yourgovernment wanted it to look like.- Who was behind the attack on Severnaya?- Who had the authorization codes?Russia may have changed, but thepenalty for terrorism is still death!- And what's the penalty for treason?- Stop it, both of you! Stop it!You're like boys with toys.It was Ourumov.General Ourumov set off the weapon.I saw him do it.Are you certain it was Ourumov?Yes. He killed everyoneand stole the GoldenEye.And why would he do that?There is another satellite.Another GoldenEye?Thank you, Miss Simonova.You were saying something aboutthe lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?Defense Minister, I must protest!This is my investigation.You are out of order.From what I am hearing,it is you who's out of order!- I have seen this gun before.- Put it down.- In the hand of our enemy.- Put it down, General!Do you even know whothe enemy is, Dimitri?- Do you?- Guard!Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...murdered by a British agent,James Bond.Himself shot whiletrying to escape. Guards!Come on!They're in the archives!Down!Spread out!Cover the other side!Trust me.Go now!Faster!Damn it!Down the alley!Use the bumper!That's what it's for!What was that?Go left!Get out!Either you've brought methe perfect gift, General Ourumov...or you've made mea very unhappy man.Mishkin got to thembefore I could.Bond is alive?He escaped.Good for Bond.Bad for you.Take a seat, my dear.You know, James and Ishared everything.Absolutely everything.To the victor go the spoils.You'll like it where we're going.You may even learn to like me.Stay with her.Bond.Only Bond.He's going to derail us.Full speed!Full speed! Ram him!Why can't you just bea good boy and die?You first.You... second.Up!Situation analysis: hopeless.You have no backup,no escape route.And I have the onlybargaining chip.Where is she?Oh, yes.Your fatal weakness.Ourumov, bring her in.Lovely girl.Tastes like...like strawberries.- I wouldn't know.- I would.So, back where we started, James.Your friend or the mission.Drop the gun.I'll let her live.Ourumov, what has thisCossack promised you?You knew, didn't you?He's a Lienz Cossack.- It's in the past.- He'll betray you!- Just like everyone else.- Is this true?What's true is that in 48 hoursyou and I will have more money than God.And Mr. Bond here will havea small memorial service...with only Moneypenny and a fewtearful restaurateurs in attendance.So, what's the choice, James?Two targets.Time enough for one shot.The girl, or the mission?Kill her.She means nothing to me.See you in hell, James.One-inch armor plating.I'm fine,thank you very much!- Boris, yes!- What are you doing?Boris is on-line,backing up his files.If I can spike him, I might be ableto find out where they're going.But don't stand there!Get us out of here!Yes, sir.Good luck with the floor, James.I set the timers for six minutes...the same six minutes you gave me.It was the leastI could do for a friend.- What does that mean?- We've got three minutes.What else do you call your butt?- What?- It's Boris' password.He plays word games: 'What I sit on,but I don't take it with me. '- Chair.- Like I said.Thirty seconds.He's not in Russia, Germany,Paris, London, Madrid.Twenty-five seconds.New York, Toronto, Chicago,San Francisco.Twenty seconds!Mexico City, Rio, Miami.- Come on!- Wait!He's in Cuba, Havana. No.Now!Do you destroy every vehicleyou get into?Standard operating procedure.'Boys with toys. 'Maybe I should take care ofthe transportation for our trip to Cuba.Our trip?Do you know howto disarm the weapon?I suppose that depends on what kind ofweapon you're talking about disarming.So, tell me.Are there any otherstandard operating procedures...I should be aware of, Commander?Thousands.But I only pay them...lip service.My whole life, I dreamed aboutcoming to the Caribbean.It's so beautiful.Not another human being in sight.What is it with youand moving vehicles?Yo, Jimbo!Brought a little gift fromold what's-his-name, uh, T, Z...?- Q.- Yeah.- What are you doing here, Wade?- Banyan trees.I am not here.The CIA has no knowledge, noinvolvement, absolutely nothing to do...with your insertion into Cuba,if you catch my drift.Yes, I do, perfectly.Borrowed the plane froma friend of mine in the DEA.Now, the Coast Guardand the FAA are both in the loop.You're cleared on our radarfor 0600 hours.Here's the latest Sat-Intfrom Langley.- Stay below 600 feet.- 500 feet.- Who's that?- Natalya Siminova.Natalya Simonova.Russian Minister of Transportation.Did you check her out?- Head to toe.- Right.So, you're looking for a dishthe size of a football field, huh?Doesn't exist. You can't light a cigarin Cuba without us seeing it.I know it's there.It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like yoursecret transmitters in New Zealand.I've never been to New Zealand.How'd she know about that?What if I need backup?Get on the radio.I'll send in the Marines.Anyway, hang a leftat the end of the runway.- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.- Yo, Wade.Just one thing: Don't pushany of the buttons on that car.- I was going to go bombing around in it.- Exactly.Yo, James, I got faith.But be careful. He knows you're coming.He was your friend, Trevelyan?And now he's your enemyand you will kill him.It is that simple?In a word, yes.Unless he kills you first.- Natalya...- You think I'm impressed?All of you with your guns,your killing, your death. For what?So you can be a hero?- All the heroes I know are dead.- Natalya, listen to me.How can you act like this?How can you be so cold?It's what keeps me alive.No.It's what keeps you alone.James?Yes?On the train...when you told him to kill meand I meant nothing to you...did you mean it?Yes.Basic rule:always call their bluff.No.Turn ten degrees south,bearing one-eight-four.Yes, sir.Nothing.There is nothing here.Let's make another pass.Maybe Wade was right.There is no dish.Natalya.This time, Mr. Bond,the pleasure will be all mine.Wait for your turn.She always did enjoya good squeeze.Is the satellite in range?- Six minutes.- Prepare the dish.No! It's too early.I am not ready.Do it!No wonder we couldn't see it.Come on.The world's greatest cash card.It had better not be rejected.- Mischa is on-line.- Sir.Kill him!The man just won't take a hint.- Target coordinates?- The target is London.He's getting readyto signal the satellite.- How do you stop it?- The transmitter above the antenna...Antenna in position.On my count.Three... two... one.God save the Queen.The mainframe computer.Don't move.James!What an unpleasant surprise.- We aim to please.- Where's the girl?Find her!So, how is old Q?Up to his usual tricks?The watch.A new model.Still press here, do I?Interesting setup, Alec.You break into the Bank of Englandvia computer...and then transferthe money electronically...just seconds beforeyou set off the GoldenEye...which erases any recordof the transactions.- Ingenious.- Thank you, James.But it still boils downto petty theft.In the end,you're just a bank robber.Nothing morethan a common thief.You always did havea small mind, James.It's not justerasing bank records.It's everything on every computerin Greater London:tax records, the stock market,credit ratings, land registries...criminal records.In 16 minutes and 43 sec...No, 42 seconds... the United Kingdomwill reenter the Stone Age.A worldwide financial meltdown.And all so mad little Alec can settlea score with the world 50 years on.Oh, please, James.Spare me the Freud.I might as well ask you if all the vodkamartinis ever silence the screams...of all the men you've killed.Or if you find forgiveness in the armsof all those willing women...for all the dead onesyou failed to protect.England is about to learnthe cost of betrayal...inflation-adjusted for 1945.- Welcome to the party, my dear.- Natalya!Don't ever do that again!This is not one ofyour games, Boris.Real people will die!You pathetic little worm.She was in the mainframe.Check the computer.She's a moron.A second-level programmer.She works onthe guidance system.She doesn't even have accessto the firing codes.Retrorockets firing!What the hell's happening?We will have reentry in...- It will burn up over the Atlantic.- Deal with it!She changed the access codes!Well, then she can fix it.Go ahead, shoot him.He means nothing to me.I can do it!- I can break her codes.- Then get on with it!Tell him, now!Give me the codes, Natalya!Give them to me!- Can Boris break your codes?- Possibly.Possibly?We have to destroythe transmitter.By the way,I'm fine, thank you very much.Do you know howto use one of these?Yes.Good.Stay out of sight.- How long?- Two minutes.

Slow down.Welcome.Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond.It is a great pleasureto meet you at last.And how do you likeour country so far?I am a trifle disappointed at the easewith which I could pull you in.The one thing my honorable mothertold me long ago......was never to get into a carwith a strange girl.But you, I\\'m afraid,will get into anything with any girl.I must say, you have a lot of energyfor a dead man, Mr. Bond.You are James Bond, aren\\'t you?I am so very pleased to meet you.I really am.Permit me to introduce myself.My name is Tanaka.Please call me Tiger.If you\\'re Tanaka,how do you feel about me?I love you.I\\'m glad we got that out of the way.I\\'d like you to examine theseas soon as possible.They\\'re from Osato\\'s safe.This is an order for naval stores.- What is lox?- It\\'s American smoked salmon.But it\\'s also the technical namefor liquid oxygen......which makes rocket fuel.- Very interesting. We must go.The journey out will bemore dignified than the journey in.That wouldn\\'t be difficult.- I\\'d like that negative enlarged.- Okay.My private train.I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.In my position,it would be most unwise.Very convenient.I imagine your Mr. M in Londonhas a similar arrangement.M? Oh, yes. But of course.Then the girl in the white sports caris one of us.Aki? Yes.Very competent.Do you like Japanese saki,or would you prefer a vodka martini?Oh, no. I like saki.Especially when it\\'s servedat the correct temperature......98.4 degrees Fahrenheit,like this is.For a European,you are exceptionally cultivated.- We\\'ll see the photograph you found.- Good.It\\'s just a ship and a strip of land.Could be anywhere.My men found a microdoton the paper.Enlarge.It says, \"Photograph taken......by female American touristfrom coastal vessel.The woman has been liquidatedas a routine precaution.\"- Can we see the photograph again?- Of course.So they killed an innocent touristfor taking this?Can you make it bigger?Ning-Po.Check motor vessel Ning-Po,full details.All recent movementsand present whereabouts.- What\\'s that on the left?- Focus on the left.- Diving girls.- Can you identify that coastline?Given time, yes.- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?- Mr. Osato.Can you arrange an appointmentwith him tomorrow?Of course. But tonight,consider my house yours......including all of my possessions,naturally.My friend, now you takeyour first civilized bath.Really?

This way, please.Thank you.Please come in, Mr. Fisher.Mr. Osato is expecting you.Thank you.You are three and a half minutes early.Please be seated.- How do you do, Mr. Fisher?- How do you do?Miss Brandt,my confidential secretary.- Hello.- Hello.May we offer youa glass of champagne?No, thank you.

You know that.- Do all their people carry guns?- When they\\'re abroad, yes.And why were you snoopingaround the docks?I like ships,and I used to be a sailor.You are a liar.- Do you know what this is?- I\\'d rather not.Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.They use it to slice off skin.I hope you won\\'t force me to use it.Well, what\\'s a nice girl like youdoing in a place like this?I have a confession to make.What?Actually, I\\'m a spy.I know that.I suppose you know thatindustrial secrets are big business.I\\'ve stolen Osato\\'s new processfor making monosodium glutamate.And...Well, it\\'s worth $300,000.So?I\\'ll split it with you if youget me out of here and back to Tokyo.That\\'s a nice offer.How about it?- I\\'m afraid not.- Why?Osato would kill me.We could fly to Europe tomorrow,you and I.The things I do for England.You\\'re going to need some very closeprotection tonight in Tokyo......because that\\'s whenthey\\'ll try and get at you.You\\'ll need the best man we\\'ve got.And who do you suggest?Well, me.I\\'m afraid I have anotherappointment tonight, Mr. Fisher.I\\'m awfully sorry to leave you,but I have to get off.Chasing girls will be the end of you.I have told you that before.He didn\\'t chase her.He did it so I could get away.He wouldn\\'t touch that horrible girl.You wouldn\\'t, would you?Oh, heaven forbid. Any progress?Yes. We have identifiedthe coastline in the photograph.It is an island called Matsu......and lies on the direct routebetween Kobe and Shanghai.We shadowed the Ning-Poin a helicopter.- Did it stop at the island?- I think so.It was a very dark night.Impossible to see her all the time.But we know she stoppedsomewhere. Look at these.That one we took last night.And that one early this morning.- Notice the waterline.- You\\'re right.Fully laden here, and empty here.I want to take a fast lookat the island now.- Has Little Nellie arrived?- Yes, and her father.Welcome to Japan, Dad.Is my little girl hot and ready?I\\'ve had a long and tiring journey,probably to no purpose.I\\'m in no moodfor your juvenile quips.I have my curiosity.What is Little Nellie?She\\'s a wonderful girl.Very small. Quite fast.Can do anything. Just your type.A toy helicopter?No, it\\'s certainly not a toy.You\\'ll see.We\\'ve madeone or two improvements.- I\\'ll give you the drill.- This can only be for children.Don\\'t use it.Take my helicopter instead.Right.

We\\'ll keep listening.Hello, Base One.- There\\'s nothing here but volcanoes.- Understood.Carry on.- Hello, Base One.- Listening.Little Nellie got a hot reception.Four big shots madeimproper advances towards her.But she defended her honorwith great success.- Heading for home.- Do not come home.Russian space shot imminent.Proceed vector 4-6 degreesand await instructions.- Understood- Roger and out.Clear the area.Prepare for reception.Radar blackout is now complete.Moscow radio is already sayingthat we did it.The president\\'s calleda press conference for 2 p.m.He\\'ll deny our involvement.- But can we prove it?- Of course we can\\'t.The world won\\'t believe the Russiansdestroyed their own spacecraft.They\\'ll use the excuseto shoot down our next Jupiter.Houston to Washington.We followed him for one orbit,now he\\'s gone off the screen.- That means he\\'s coming down.- Yeah, but where?Someplace in Russia. It has to be.The British theory about Japanis nonsense.- Forget Japan.- I agree.We rephotographedevery square inch.Ventilator fans to full power.Open all air ducts.Area safe to enter.All crews to stations.All air ducts to normal.Air ducts open.- Close crater.- Closing crater.Fire guards to station.Ventilator fans to normal.Open shutters.Reception complete.Withdraw captive spaceship.Guards to stations.- Remove the prisoners.- Remove the prisoners.I shall be in my apartment.I may send for you later.I must congratulate you, gentlemen,upon your superb equipment.We congratulate youon how you handle it.Our clients are satisfiedwith the progress so far?- My government is quite satisfied.- Good.Hans.You will see that my piranha fishget very hungry.They can strip a manto the bone in 30 seconds.I have decided to askfor a little money in advance.I want the sum of a hundredmillion dollars in gold bullion......deposited in our accountin Buenos Aires.Our agreement states quite clearlythat no money should be paid......until war has broken out betweenRussia and the United States.- This is extortion.- Extortion is my business.Think it over, gentlemen. I\\'m busy.Osato and Number 11, report now.An unknown Englishmanwas in your office the other day.Correct, Number One.- Do you know what gun this is?- Walther PPK.Only one person we knowuses this sort of gun.James Bond.- But Bond is dead.- It was in all the newspapers.Rubbish. Bond is alive.Unless you killed him, Mr. Osato.Don\\'t tell me you let him go.I gave Number 11 the strictest ordersto eliminate him.- And did she?- She failed.You should have killed him yourself.You had plenty of opportunity.This organizationdoes not tolerate failure.- I know, but...- Go.Well?Kill Bond, now!Yes, Number One. Yes.- Hello.- Bad news from outer space.Yes, I heard it. Now the Russiansare accusing the Americans.Next time it will be war.- We\\'ll have to get to those volcanoes.- I agree.We\\'ll also need a companyof first-rate men.Do you have any commandos here?I have much, much better.Ninjas. Top secret, Bond-san.This is my ninja training school.- Ninjas?- The art of concealment and surprise.This must developvery fast reflex actions.And spiritual strength.Now we will see some modern ninjas.My plan is this:I make a base on the Ama Island.One hundred of my ninjaswill slide in unseen.They will be workers and fishermen.- What about me?- Later.For the moment,these will interest you.

My parents are dead.Sit down, please.Oysters.Is this the only room there is?Yes. That is your bed.I shall sleep over there.We\\'re supposed to be married.Think again, please.You gave false name to priest.Yes, but we must keep upappearances. It\\'s our honeymoon.No honeymoon.

Who are you?...pharmacy siteshas providedan excellent new sales platform.We have adapted many of them intoclearinghouses for unapproved drugs.In addition to which,the latest figures showthat we presently control70% of antimalarial vaccines,34% of H.I.V.,and 40% of all oncological drugsacross Sub-Saharan Africa.But we face challengesfrom the WHOin their campaign against ourcounterfeit pharmaceuticals.We have now identified thekey individuals to target.We expect the samesuccess as we hadagainst the Councilon Human Trafficking.Since the board\\'s resignation.....we have placed 160,000 migrated femalesinto the leisure sector.The impending completion ofthe Global Surveillance initiative......will mean our capabilityis second to none......and now is the momentfor aggressive expansion.The news is only good...Don\\'t let me interrupt you.The news is only good...Our increased surveillance capability......means governmentintelligence agencies......are easily counteracted.We are winning.Thank you, Doctor.Now, on to the matter at hand.After the success of ourattacks in Hamburg and Tunisia,the aborted attackin Mexico Cityand the death of our valued colleague,Marco Sciarra,leaves one of his dutiesoutstanding.Signor Guerra,The Pale King must be terminated.Will you makethe journey to Altaussee?Of course.My loyalty to this organization is total.I will protect it with my last breath.There will be no more......amateurs.No more shows of weakness.Does anyone challenge SignorGuerra for this position?Welcome.State your credentials forsucceeding Signor Sciarra.It\\'s funny.All that excitement in MexicoCity rang a distant bell.And now,suddenly, this evening,it makes perfect sense.Welcome, James.It\\'s been a long time.But, finally, here we are.What took you so long?Cuckoo.Ciao, Mickey Mouse.Oh, you\\'ve got to be kidding me.No.Moneypenny.Bond?Listen, Moneypenny.Hamburg, Tunisia,Mexico City, they\\'re all linked.It\\'s one organizationcoordinating multiple attacks.So, she was right.Of course, she was.- I ran that check.- Who is it?Oh, my boss had hiscredit card stolen.It\\'s nothing.Why don\\'t you go back to sleep.Don\\'t be long.- Who was that?- No one.No, it wasn\\'t.It\\'s just a friend.At this time of night?It\\'s called life, James.You should try it sometime.The Pale King. It looks likeyou\\'ve had dealings with him before.Quantum.Of course.Mr. White!That\\'s him.Last unconfirmed sighting,Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.Hold that thought.You still there?Yeah.Run another name, will you?Okay. Go.A man calledFranz Oberhauser. He\\'s...And check his filesbefore and after his death.After his death?What are you talking about?Please, just do it.Okay, Q, give me something.That\\'s more like it.Here goes nothing.Good evening.Do not let them tell youwe need less surveillance.We need more. Much more.I say again, the Nine Eyescommittee would have full accessto the combined intelligencestreams of all member states.More data, more analysis,less likelihood ofa terrorist attack.Ladies and gentlemen,it\\'s time for the securityservices of the world to unite.Alone, we are weak.Together, we\\'re a global power.An unelected one.Thank you.Thank you.We will now voteon the resolution.Ladies and gentlemen,please cast your vote.The vote is eightto one in favor.However, as you know,we cannot proceedunless by unanimous vote.The Nine Eyes motionis therefore not passed.Democracy.Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.This evening\\'s session is adjourned.Yes, sir.Please, tell me 007is in London.Oh, yes.Um, I\\'ll just takea look now, sir.Because if he isn\\'t,you\\'re in deep shit.You\\'ve got precisely 10 seconds.I have him, sir.He appears to be in Chelsea.Well, I want eyes on himwhen I get back, understood?I completely understand,sir.Do me a favor.Make it quick.Upstairs, Mr. White.I always knew death wouldwear a familiar face,but not yours.To what do I owethis pleasure, Mr. Bond?I was at a meeting recentlyand your name came up.I\\'m flattered London isstill talking about me.It wasn\\'t MI6.It was Rome.Your team, not mine.Ah.Last month,I found thallium in my cell phone.It\\'s done its job.I have a few weeks. Maybe less.So, here we are, Mr. Bond,two dead menenjoying the evening.What did you do?I disobeyed him.I followed himas far as I could.He changed.Oh, I see.You grew a conscience.Our game is our game.But this?Women, children...Well, the thallium would suggestthat he doesn\\'t like youvery much anymore.And clearlythe feeling is mutual.So why don\\'t you tell mehow to find him again?Oh, come on.Tell me where he is.He\\'s everywhere.Everywhere!He\\'s sitting at your desk,he\\'s kissing your lover,he\\'s eating supper with your family!You\\'re protecting someone.Your wife.She left long ago.Your son?Your daughter.You won\\'t find her.She\\'s clever.She\\'s smarter than me.She knows how to hide.I can protect her ifyou tell me where he is.I can keep her alive.Yeah.You have my word.Your word?The word of an assassin!That\\'s my word.L\\'Amricain.You save her,she can lead you to L\\'Amricain.She knows L\\'Amricain.Try the Hoffler Klinik.You\\'re a kite dancing in a hurricane,Mr. Bond.So long.I can\\'t deny I\\'m impressed yougot H.M.G. to cough up for all this.Good God, the government couldn\\'tafford this kind of facility.No, it was benefactors mostly,from the private sector.When it goes online,this building will bethe most sophisticateddata gathering systemin history.The world\\'s digital ghost,available 24/7.George Orwell\\'s worst nightmare.I\\'m glad you like it.My commiserationson losing the Nine Eyes vote.Must have been a blow.Not really.Only a matter of timebefore the South Africanssee the light.And you know what they say,Rome wasn\\'t built in a day.Day and a half maybe.Look, Max,I know surveillance is a fact of life.It\\'s how you use theinformation that concerns me,and who is using it.This is what we need to doto keep the people safe.Double-0 programis prehistoric.Come on, M. You can\\'t really tellme that one man in the fieldcan compete with all of this,running around out therewith his license to kill.Have you ever hadto kill a man, Max?Have you?To pull that trigger,you have to be sure.Yes, you investigate,analyze, assess, target.And then you haveto look him in the eye.And you make the call.And all the drones, bugs,cameras, transcripts,all the surveillancein the worldcan\\'t tell you what to do next.A license to killis also a license not to kill.I didn\\'t want tohave to do this,but it looks like you stillcan\\'t control your agents.Bond? I ran that check.Looks like you\\'ve had dealingswith him before. Quantum.Of course. Mr. White!Last unconfirmed sighting,Altaussee in Austria.Run another name, will you?So maybe there\\'ssomething to be saidfor total surveillanceafter all.You watch MI6 agents?We watch everyone.Please, take a seat.I\\'ll be with youin just a moment.Please excuse me,Mr. Bond.My name isDr. Madeleine Swann.Our job today is toanalyze your needs,both psychological and physical.Hmm, sounds prettystraightforward.I hope you don\\'t mind.The view can be distracting.I hadn\\'t noticed.I see you filled outmost of the paperwork.Just a few questions to completeyour evaluation, if I may.Do you exercise?When I have to.Do you consider your employmentto be psychologically stressful?Sometimes.How much alcohol do you consume?Too much.Some broader questions.As a child, would you say youwere close to your parents?My parents diedwhen I was young.Really? How old?Old enough to remember.How, if I may ask?It was a climbing accident.So who brought you up?Someone else.Humor me.How does one train at Oxford andthe Sorbonne become a consultant,spend two years withMdecins Sans Frontiresand end up here?Forgive me,but anyone might thinkyou were hiding from something.You\\'re paying a lot of money to be here,Mr. Bond.Who\\'s asking the questions,you or me?Of course. Carry on.I see you left thisfinal question blank.What is your occupation?Well, that\\'s not the sort ofthing that looks good on a form.And why is that?I kill people.Small world?Where is he?Your father\\'s dead.Two days ago.How do you know?Because I was there.Did you kill him?I didn\\'t have to.He did it himself.And you came all the wayjust to tell me this?That my father\\'s dead?I came to tell you that your lifeis in danger and I need your help.Why?I made a deal with him to protect you.You\\'re lying.Why would he trust you?Because he knew that Ineeded something in return.And what was that?To find L\\'Amricain.This interview is over.Dr. Swann...You have 10 minutes to leave the building.Then I\\'m calling security.Thank you,Dr. Swann.Can I get you something, sir?Vodka martini.Shaken, not stirred.I\\'m sorry,we don\\'t serve alcohol.I\\'m really startingto love this place.He\\'ll have the prolyticdigestive enzyme shake.Certainly.If you\\'ve come for the car,I parked itat the bottom of the Tiber.Well, not to worry, 007.It was only a 3,000,000 prototype.Why are you here, Q?Oh, I just fancied a break,to be honest.I\\'ve been a tad stressedat work recently.What with C\\'s peoplecrawling all over usand the fact that M wants myballs for Christmas decorations.Get to the point.The point, 007,is that Franz Oberhauseris dead.Dead and buried.And unless you come backwith me right now,my career and Moneypenny\\'swill go the same way.Do you understand?All hell is breaking loose out there and...I saw him.You thought you saw him.We\\'ve been through the records.He died in an avalanchewith his father 20 years ago.Yes. I know that.But I saw him.He\\'s not someoneI\\'ll ever forget.So you have a lead?I have a name.L\\'Amricain.Well, that narrows it down.Look, I\\'m sorry, 007,but time\\'s up.My whole careeris on the line here.Either you come back in and dothis through proper channels,or I go directly to M.Do one more thing for me.Then you\\'re out.Find out what you can from this.I really, reallyhate you right now.Thank you, Q.Monsieur?Now? Please?Where are you staying?The Pevsner. Room 12.One hour.Here you are, sir.One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.Do me a favor, will you?Throw that down the toilet.Cut out the middleman.No! Stay.What do you want?What are you doing?Can\\'t any of you speak?Come on!Argh, don\\'t touch me!Hey!You need to take a breath and calm down.You\\'re in shock.Get away from me!Just get away!Did it cross your mindthat you led them to me?I haven\\'t got time for this.You need to tell me everythingyou know about L\\'Amricain.Go to hell!I gave your father my word!And why should I trust you?Because my father did?Because right now,Dr. Swann,I\\'m your best chanceof staying alive.Dr. Swann, Q.Q, Dr. Swann.Hello.Enchanted.Bond, we needto talk. Alone.She knows.But, Bond...She knows.What have you got?I owe you an apology, 007.You are onto something.Oberhauser is still alive.The ring proves it.And it seems they wereall part of one organization.Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,your friend Mr. Silva.And do you knowwho links them all?Him.Exactly.This organization,do you know what it\\'s called?- No.- Spectre.Its name is Spectre.How does she know that?Because my fatherwas part of it.Then I think thatyou ought to see this.You\\'re looking at picturesfrom South Africa right nowof what appears to bea huge explosion.Q, go back to London.M\\'s gonna need your help.And keep tracking me.I will.And, Bond, you haveto find L\\'Amricain.He\\'s our only linkto Oberhauser.It\\'s not a person.It\\'s a place.Thank you.This is where they spenttheir wedding night.They came back every year.Then they brought mewith them, too.He kept coming back,even after the divorce.Well, then I\\'m sorry.What for?Ah-ha!What is it?It\\'s your inheritance.Want some?No, thank you.You don\\'t knowwhat you\\'re missing.This can\\'t be it.Well, here\\'s to your father.I promised myself I would neverbe hurt by that man again.I cut off all contact.I didn\\'t want anything to dowith him or his sick life.And then, with his dying breathhe sends me you.Ironic, no?You shouldn\\'t be so hard on him.The man I just met shouldhave been dead weeks ago.The only reason his heartwas still beating was you.I\\'ll mourn my fatherin my own time, Mr. Bond.And, now, I\\'m going to bed.Oh.Don\\'t think for one moment thisis where I fall into your arms,seeking solacefor my dead daddy.You sit there.Keep watch.That\\'s what you\\'re good at.Come anywhere near meand I\\'ll kill you.I don\\'t doubt it.Look.

Thanks.All the very best.What\\'s going on?The meeting was brought forward.Did you not get the message?No, we didn\\'t.Shortest meeting I can remember.South Africans on board,I take it?Yeah, well, who can blame them?Nine Eyes is nowofficially sanctioned.The new system goes livein less than 72 hours.It\\'s a major step forward.Global intelligence cooperationchanges everything.As you said before.Look.They\\'ve asked meto head the new committee.Yes? And?And I should tell you I\\'vespoken with the Home Secretary.And in light of the newinformation I\\'ve given him,he\\'s decided to close down the double-0program with immediate effect.You don\\'t knowwhat you\\'re doing.It\\'s not personal.It\\'s the future.And...You\\'re not.You\\'re a cocky little bastard,aren\\'t you?I\\'ll take that as a compliment.I wouldn\\'t.This isn\\'t over yet.Would you press this for me?Thank you. Yes, sir.Pick it up.I hate guns.I promised him I\\'d protect you.The first thing to do is to teachyou how to protect yourself.What if I shoot you by mistake?Wouldn\\'t be the first time.Pick it up.I said, I hate guns.SIG 226.Front sight.Rear sight.

But if you look at the satelliteblowup, you can clearly see this.We can\\'t help him.But, sir, we knowwhere he\\'s heading.C is watching everything we do.We\\'re only handing themmore information.Sir, we can\\'t just desert Bond.We have to.We only make him weaker.But, sir,we know exactly where he is.Yes, I know, but if we can track him,so can others.Delete allthe Smart Blood files.Everything.He\\'s on his own.You shouldn\\'t stare.Well, you shouldn\\'tlook like that.May I get you an apritif?I\\'m not sure.It gets me into trouble.Makes me do crazy things.Well, we can\\'t have that.So, I\\'ll havea vodka martini, dirty.Make that two.I have a question.Well, what\\'s that?Why, given everyother possible option,does a man choose thelife of a paid assassin?Well, it was thator the priesthood.I\\'m serious.Is this really what you want?Living in the shadows?Hunting? Being hunted?Always looking behind you?Always alone?But I\\'m not alone.Answer the question.I\\'m not sure I everhad a choice.Anyway, I don\\'t stopto think about it.What would happen if you did?Stop?Yes.I don\\'t know.Your drinks, sir.Could you leavethem there, please.You know, I think you\\'re wrong.I am?We always have a choice.I\\'ll drink to that.Shit.What do we do now?This might be a long wait.Are you having second thoughts?Too late now.What\\'s that?That is a 1948 Rolls-RoyceSilver Wraith.Please.I\\'m scared, James.Good afternoon,Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.I want you to know just how excitedwe all are to finally meet you.Well,it\\'s a pleasure to be here.Your host invitesyou both to rest,relax, and join himfor drinks at 4:00.- Tell our host we won\\'t be late.- Wonderful.Before we show you to your rooms,just one more thing.Oh.You be careful with that.It\\'s loaded.Thank you.This is a very special place.He has requestedyou enter it alone.Of course.Champagne?Maybe later.Certainly.I thinkwe\\'re meant to be impressed.Touch it.You can touch it if you want.Do you know what it is?It\\'s a meteorite.Yes, exactly.The Kartenhoff.The oldest in human possession.The very meteoritewhich made this crater.Think about it.So many years up there,alone, silent,building momentum until it choseto make its mark on Earth.A huge, unstoppable force.Except it did stop, didn\\'t it?Right here.I can\\'t tell you how much I\\'vebeen looking forward to this.All of us here, together.A reunion.I\\'m so glad you came,too, dear Madeleine.You were just a girlwhen I saw you first.I came to your home onceto see your father.I don\\'t remember that.But I do.Shall we?What is this place?Information.Information is all,is it not?For example,you must know by now that thedouble-0 program is officially dead.Which leads me tospeculate exactly why you came.So, James, why did you come?I came here to kill you.And I thought youcame here to die.Well, it\\'s alla matter of perspective.Speaking of perspective.Is this live?Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.What an uncanny coincidence.The French have a saying,\"It\\'s the fate of glass to break.\"Well, maybe it\\'s the fateof spies to just disappear.But with any luck,we leave something behind.In the meantime,I\\'m sure C will keep you all busy.Thank you all.That\\'s touching,don\\'t you think?Well, James,it looks like you\\'re all alone.Not much more than a voyeur,are you?Too scared to join in.I don\\'t thinkyou quite understand.Oh, I think I do.You set cities on fire andwatch innocent people burn,so you can convincegovernments to joinan intelligence networkyou\\'ve paid for.Not that complicated.I\\'m guessing our little friend,C, he\\'s one of your disciples.You could say that.And what does he get out of it?Nothing.He\\'s a visionary, like me.Visionaries.Psychiatric wardsare full of them.Whereas you couldn\\'t seewhat\\'s right in front of you.You came across me so manytimes and yet you never saw me.Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.All dead.Yeah, that\\'s right.A nice pattern developed.You interfered in my world,I destroyed yours.Or did you thinkit was coincidencethat all the women inyour life ended up dead?Vesper Lynd, for example.She was the big one.Has he told you about her?And then, of course,your beloved M.Gone forever.Me.It was all me, James.It\\'s always been me.The author of all your pain.You\\'re a brave woman, my dear.Now I understand whymy father lost his mind.He didn\\'t lose his mind,he was just weak.But at least he understoodwhat he was up against.You see,they failed to comprehend the crucial fact,that a terrible event canlead to something wonderful.Since you mention your father,I\\'ll show you.She\\'s clever.She\\'s smarter than me.She knows how to hide.I can protect her if youtell me where he is.I can keep her alive.Yeah.You have my word.No, no, no. Turn this off.Your word?The word of an assassin!Turn this off.This is important.I said turn it off!I want you tounderstand something.That\\'s my word.Madeleine?Look at me.Don\\'t look at him,Madeleine. Look at me.L\\'Amricain.You save her,she can lead you to L\\'Amricain.She knows L\\'Amricain.Try the Hoffler Klinik.You\\'re a kite dancing in a hurricane,Mr. Bond.So long.The things thatbring people together.Out of horror, beauty.Torture is easy,on a superficial level.A man can watch himselfbeing disemboweledand derive great horrorfrom the experience,but it\\'s stillgoing on at a distance.It isn\\'t takingplace where he is.As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,a man lives inside his head.That\\'s wherethe seat of his soul is.Now, James and I wereboth present recentlywhen a man wasdeprived of his eyes.And the mostastonishing thing happened.Didn\\'t you notice?He wasn\\'t there anymore.He\\'d gone even thoughhe was still alive.So in this brief momentbetween life and death,there was nobodyinside his skull.Most odd.So, James.I\\'m going to penetrateto where you are.To the inside of your head.Now, the first probewill play with your sight,your hearingand your balance,just with the subtlestof manipulations.Well, get on with it then.Nothing can be as painfulas listening to you talk.All right.Let\\'s begin.Why are you doing this?You probably knowthat James herelost his parentswhen he was young.But did you knowthat it was my fatherwho helped him throughthis difficult time?Over the course of two wintershe taught him to ski,and climb, and hunt.He soothed the wounds of thepoor little blue-eyed orphan.Asked me to treathim as a brother.My little brother.They formed quite an attachment.So,you killed him.Yes, I did.You know what happenswhen a cuckoohatches insideanother bird\\'s nest?Yes.It forces the other eggs out.Yes.Well, this cuckoo made me realizemy father\\'s life had to end.In a way, he\\'s responsiblefor the path I took.- So, thank you.- Cuckoo.Do you know any otherbirdcalls, Franz?Hello, pussy.Franz Oberhauser died20 years ago, James.In an avalanche,alongside his father.The man you are talking to now,the man inside your head,is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.Catchy name.My mother\\'s bloodline.If the needle finds the correctspot in the fusiform gyrus,you\\'ll recognize no one.Of course,the faces of your womenare interchangeable,aren\\'t they, James?You won\\'t know who she is.Just another passing faceon your way to the grave.He dies not knowing who you are.The daughter of an assassin.The only one who couldhave understood him.Shame.I love you.Do those blue eyesstill recognize you?I\\'d recognize you anywhere.The watch.One minute.One minute.Did he say something?Tempus fugit.- What?- Tempus fugit.I can\\'t hear you, James.I said,doesn\\'t time fly?In there!Let\\'s go home.It\\'s not over yet.I\\'ve never evenheard of Hildebrand.That is the generalidea with safe houses.Exactly how safe is this, sir?We\\'re about to find out.It\\'s safe.Better wait here.I\\'m M.Madeleine Swann.Pleased to meet you.So, what do youhave for me, 007?The recently deceased head of Spectre,Ernst Stavro Blofeld,and his chief of intelligence,your new best friend, C.About to take control of his veryown global surveillance systemthat he built righthere under our noses.Then we\\'d better move.The system goes online at midnight.If that happens,Spectre will have control of everything.So, you and I willhave a quiet word with Cwhile Q hacks into the systemand stops it going online.It won\\'t be easy.He\\'ll find a way.He always does.It\\'s good to have you back, 007.Sir.James, I can\\'t.I\\'ll come back for youwhen it\\'s all over.No, I can\\'t.No, you can\\'tstay here, or you...I can\\'t go back to this life.And I\\'m not going to ask you to change.This is who you are.You\\'re saying good-bye.Yes.Take care.You\\'re a good man, James.Are you in yet, Q?A few layers of impenetrablesecurity still to go,but I thinkI\\'m getting somewhere.They\\'ve seen us! Reverse!Go!Get him in the building!Move. Move!Go back and find M, now!We need them both.Not a good feelingbeing watched, is it?Don\\'t tell me you\\'reresponsible for this.No, but my Quartermaster is.And he\\'s extremely talented.Well, bravo.But in case you hadn\\'t realized it,you two are out of a job.So you\\'re trespassing.I\\'m afraid you\\'ve got thewrong end of the stick, Max.We\\'re going to stop thissystem going online.And then I\\'m goingto bring you in.On what grounds exactly?Poor taste in friends.Take a look at the world.Chaos.Because people like you,paper-pushersand politicians,are too spineless to dowhat needs to be done.So I made an alliance to putthe power where it should be.And now you want to throw it awayfor the sake of \"democracy.\"Whatever the hell that is.How predictably moronic.But then isn\\'t thatwhat M stands for?\"Moron.\"And now we knowwhat C stands for.\"Careless.\"Come on.No, no, no!You\\'re a hard manto kill, Blofeld.Ouch.I do hope thatdoesn\\'t hurt too much.My wounds will heal.What about yours?Look around you,James. Look.This is what\\'sleft of your world.Everything you ever stood for,everything you believed in, a ruin.Why are we here?Did you miss me?No.But I know someone who does.Where is she?That\\'s for you to find out.In three minutes,this building will be demolished.I can get out easily.Now, you have a choice.Die trying to save her orsave yourself andlive with the pain.You\\'re bluffing.Am I?I\\'ve really put you through it,haven\\'t I?That\\'s brothers for you.They always knowwhich buttons to press.Madeleine!Come on.Come on.Yes!Let\\'s go.After you.Why can\\'t you just face it, M?You don\\'t matter anymore.Maybe I don\\'t.But something has to.Dead.- Any word on Bond?- No.But I can hazard a guess.Madeleine!Madeleine!Do you trust me?Do I have a choice?Not anymore.Come on!Good-bye, James Bond.Brace, brace, brace!Sir, this is a terrorist alert.Mallory, double-0 section.Stand them down.Echo team, hold fire.Stand down.Finish it.Finish it.Out of bullets.And besides,I\\'ve got something better to do.Under the SpecialMeasures Act of 2001,I am detaining you on behalfof Her Majesty\\'s Government.Bond?What are you doing here?Good morning, Q.I thought you\\'d gone.I have.There\\'s just one thing I need.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=spectre',\n",

Get him into his pajamas.Sir, identity, please.Thank you, sir.This is a normal training sortie,and you'll be accompanied...by a NATO representative,Commandant Derval...Major Derval of NATO.It's a routine flight.You'll be flying a Vulcan...at an altitude of 45,000 feet...armed with two atomic bombs,M.O.S. Type.Fuses as usualin the white security box.Oh, those damned aeroplanes!They're enough to drive you mad.Unless, of course,it's that mink glove of yours.I'll shut out the noise.James, where are you going?Nowhere. I thoughtI'd take a little exercise.You must be joking.Come on.Quiet!Can I help you?County Police here.Hello?- What's going on?- I don't know.Could it be the front doorbell?- It most certainly could not.- Hello.Haven't you had enough exercisefor one evening?It's funny you should say that.Point of return...Switch from manual to auto.It's set on automatic. Commandant...would you care to change placeswith the copilot?- Better view up here.- I'd be delighted.This is Southern Radar.You are now underpositive radar control.This is avoiding action.Request you report your position.Take this, will you?What's the flap, Dawson?O-B-N-R, sir. NATO training flight.Air traffic flashed us.They lost it on radar. We haven'tbeen able to pick it up anywhere.Was she losing altitudewhen she went off the screen?Rapidly.We can't scan below 300 feet.- She may have gone down.- Was she in trouble?Not according to the last report,which came from about here.- She is armed, isn't she?- Two atomic weapons, M.O.S. Type.Get everything you can into the area.A thorough search.Notify the Admiralty at once.Top priority. Absolute security.- Ask them to contact Washington.- Very good, sir.Is there anything else in sight?No. All clear.Switch onthe underwater landing lights.Open the underwater hatch.- Stand by to winch in the submarine.- Man the winches!- Give these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.- Right, sir.Get the submarine up quickly andthe bombs loaded in the containers.Kutze, are you pleasedwith your new toys?Some new safety device.A secret control.What can they have that the greatLadislav Kutze cannot handle?Life was much simplerin my Warsaw laboratory.Your share will amount tohow many Nobel Prizes?Pull forward!More. Hold it!Paris, sir.Number One on the scrambler.Number Two speaking.Phase two completed.Number Two has done well,unlike Count Lippe...whose choice of Angelo might havejeopardized the success of our project.Send a message to the Execution Branch.You will write,or telephone at the least.Day by day. I'm truly sorryI have to dash off like this.There's been a bitof a flap at the office.- What kind of work do you do?- I travel...sort of a licensed troubleshooter.Mr. Angelo. Heart attack last night.I'm not surprised.- Keep in touch.- Anytime, James. Anyplace.Another time, another place.- You are late!- Yes.Some people on the roadreally burn you up these days.In the conference room.Something pretty big.Every Double-0 man in Europe has beenrushed in, and the Home Secretary too.His wife's probably lost her dog.Well, now that we're all here...The Prime Ministerhas asked the Home Secretary...to come and represent him here today.The Home Secretary.Gentlemen, the tapethat you are about to hear...was received at 10 Downing Streetthis morning.My dear Prime Minister.Two atomic bombs...numbers 4-5-6 and 4-5-7...which were aboard NATO flight 7-5-9...are now in the possession of Spectre.Unless within the next seven daysyour government...pays to usin a manner to be designated by us...we shall destroya major city in England...or the United States of America.Please signal your acceptanceof our terms by arranging...for Big Ben to strike seven times...at 6:00 p. m. Tomorrow.The Prime Minister and the President...have talked togetherover the hot line and have agreed...that unless the bombs are recovered,payment will have to be made.To avoid general panic...complete secrecy will be maintainedand no press announcements.The Prime Minister has askedthat your department...take charge of the operation.Thank you. Sir John.This circle representsthe full flying range of the Vulcan.Extensive search has failed to locateany evidence of either a crash...or landing, and worldwide reportshave proved negative...on all airfields large enoughto handle the Vulcan.- That's all we have, sir.- Thank you, Sir John.I'll leave you to carry on.We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.Thank you, sir.You may now open the foldersin front of you.Code name: Thunderball.As you can see,we've very little to go on.All the members of the crew...had top security clearance.You'll find their photographsand service records in your files.You'll be working with NATO, C.I. A...and all allied intelligence units.That's all...until you discuss yourindividual assignments with me.I've assigned youto station C, Canada.Group Captain Pritchard herewill be your Air Force liaison.Sir, I respectfully suggest thatyou change my assignment to Nassau.Is there any other reason besidesyour enthusiasm of water sports?Perhaps this, sir.- Well?- There was a photograph of that man...in this dossier you gave us.His name is Derval.I saw him last night at Shrublands,but he was dead.Oh, no, sir. Not possible.He was seen...boarding the Vulcanand took off last night.If 007 says he saw Dervallast night and he was dead...that's enough for meto initiate inquiries.Yes, of course.- Who is this girl?- Derval's sister.- Do you know where she is now?- Nassau.Do you think she's worth going after?I wouldn't put it quite that way.We've only got four days.Don't spend your time sitting around.No, sir, I won't.Good luck.Thank you, sir.Smashing figure.I don't suppose...that has anything to dowith your request?Was there ever a manmore misunderstood?You can't pull the wool over my eyes.You may be able to con the old man,but I know better. I could...So do I, Miss Moneypenny.And I'll thank you not to refer to meas the old man.I think I had a hat when I came in.How else will you recognize her?Couldn't miss.She has two moles on the left thigh.- Thank you, Mr...- James Bond.I arrived soon after you went down.- I've been admiring your form.- Have you?Your name's James Bondand you've been admiring my form.Most girls just paddle around.- You swim like a man.- So do you.I've had quite a bit of practice.- Do you come here often?- Whenever I'm bored.Practically every day.What else do you do, and where?- You don't waste time, do you?- No.- For effort.- Thank you.I'll wear it so you know me next time.I was right. Couldn't miss.- I'm not with you.- You soon will be.Paula!- Give me a hand, will you?- Get in.Tell London I've made contactwith the girl.Well, it's not what I'd call contact.I'll pass it throughyou've seen the girl.- Keep trying.- It won't start!Ahoy there! Our motor's conked out.You wouldn't be going anywherenear Coral Harbor, would you?I wasn't, but I could.I have a very important appointment.I'd appreciate a lift.Come aboard then!You don't mind takingthe service boat, do you?Not at all.Hurry up!- Perhaps lunch by the pool.- How about your urgent appointment?How long have you been out here?About three weeks.Don't you ever stop asking questions?All right. Change of tack.Have some of my conch chowder.You've been readingthe wrong books, Mr. Bond.- About conch chowder?- Being an aphrodisiac.It just so happens thatI like conch chowder.Friend of yours?- Works for my guardian.- Your guardian has you watched?- He likes to know where I am.- I don't blame him.- Will you excuse me?- You're not going so soon?I'm afraid so.My guardian's yacht.Oh, really?- He'll be expecting me.- May I come with you?- I'd love to meet your guardian.- Oh, no.- Will I see you again?- It's a small island.- Perhaps we can have dinner together.- No.- My dear, uncooperative Domino.- How do you know that?How do you knowmy friends call me Domino?It's on the bracelet on your ankle.What sharp little eyes you've got.Wait till you get to my teeth.Bye then.See you tomorrow on the beach.- 500 pounds, please.- Certainly, monsieur.Thanks.Sorry.- There.- Thank you.Two hundred.Eight.Someone has to lose.Yes, I thought I sawa spectre at your shoulder.What do you mean?The spectre of defeat.Your luck was due to change.We'll soon find out.Any objection to raise the limit?- Too big for me.- Count me out too.Perhaps you would liketo take the shoe.My friend won't mind, Mr...- Bond.- Oh, yes. Mr. Bond.- One of my associates spoke about you.- Nothing bad, I hope.It's your spectre against mine.You wish to put the evil eye on me?We have a way to deal with thatwhere I come from.You may hex me.Let's see what it does for the cards.- No.- Seven.Six.Eight.Nine.You seem to be unbeatable, Mr. Bond.For the moment.This sort of thing can't last.Emilio, you promisedto buy me a drink.Soon, my dear.I want to get my money back first.May I be allowedto buy the lady a drink?- I would appreciate that.- Then I must pass the shoe.He's going to be impossibleif his luck doesn't change.Somehow, I don't think it will tonight.Beluga caviar, Dom Perignon, '55.- Monsieur.- Thank you.I understand you're Mr. Largo's niece.Sounds better than... What would you say?Mistress? Kept woman?I wouldn't say that.Where did you meet him?In Capri. I was therewith my brother, Francois.Strange. I found Emilio attractive...then.- Does he live aboard the yacht?- No. He has a house on the island.Must we talk about him?I'd much rather dance.So would I.- Where is your brother now?- In England.He's a Commandantwith the NATO forces there.He's a wonderful person.The trouble isI never meet anyone like him.- Only men like Largo and myself.- You are not like Largo.No?Why do you say that?The way you hold me.There.- How long are you staying in Nassau?- We're going the day after tomorrow.As I said,we haven't got much time.Emilio wants to leave.Are you sleeping aboard tonight?I hoped you'd not be so obvious.Well, when one has so little time,one sort of has to be obvious.- You know where you can find me.- Mr. Bond.Your niece is an excellent dancer.Let me prove I'm as good a loseras you are a winner.Come to lunch on Sunday.The Palmyra. It's my house.Sunday at noon, then.My dear.- Good night.- Good night.You must tell me what Mr. Bondhad to say, word for word.He talked about you a little.What was he saying just then?I didn't quite hear.He asked were wesleeping aboard tonight.Interesting.- My key. It's 304, please.- Thank you. 304.- I'm sorry, no mail.- Thank you.Well, hello, 00...That's a fine wayto treat the C.I.A.Sorry about that, Felix,but you were about to say 007.Here.Have you killed him?You know me better than that.Here you go, Smiler.Have you seen everythingyou came to see?Go back to your friends and report.Tell them, the little fish I throw backinto the sea. Give it to him.You're going to shoot me in the back.The gun, I mean.Get out!- Who was he?- Like I said, a small fish...working for a Mr. Largo.He's got a yachtwe should take a look at later.- Quist to see Mr. Largo.- Open up.Yes? It's Quist.Gently, my friend.- What did you find?- Nothing.- You saw Bond?- Yes, I saw him.What happened?You let him get the better of you.Hey, there,did you finally make contact?You're late. Felix Leiter,this is Pinder, our man here.- How do you do?- This way, gentlemen.- Who's the girl?- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.He has no plansto visit the United States.Now here's a special announcement...from the Overseas Serviceof the B.B.C.Big Ben actually did strikeseven times at 6:00 this evening.This was causedby a mechanical failure...which last occurred duringa violent electrical storm in 1898.And here once againare the headlines.Obviously stalling for time.- Oh, no!- Ah, 007.- What a wonderful surprise.- For me too.I must say, I find this businessof equipping you in the field...on the run, as it were...highly irregular.Here we have a Geiger counter.Useful and unobtrusive.The sweep handtakes the radioactivity count.- It's waterproof, of course.- But of course.Now, here's something I want youto use with special care.- With special care.- Everything you give me...Is treated with equal contempt.Yes, I know.But that's an underwater camera.It takes eight pictures...in rapid successionby pressing that button there.- Is that clever?- If you can take pictures...in the dark with an infrared film, yes.Try to be a little less thanyour usual frivolous self, 007.Here's a miniature Very pistol...which fires a bright red flare,a distress signal.You should keep it on youday and night.I resent that remark.Look, do you mind?Now, in the event of a re-breathernot being available...you can use this devicefor short periods only, of course.Say, about four minutes.- Clever.- You'll only use it as a last resort.It closesto a convenient pocket size.Assuming one has a convenient pocket.Now pay attention.A recently developed...harmless radioactive device.Harmless.It sends out a homing signalto a special receiver.- What am I supposed to do with this?- Obviously, you...swallow it.Now?Let's hope she'll still be lyingin the same place tonight.We'll use this catamaranas a rendezvous place for later.Good idea.Take her in.A container will be droppedoff the coast of Burma...in the Megui Archipelago...latitude 20 degrees north,longitude 60 degrees east...at 20 hundred hoursGreenwich mean time on May 27.It will hold blue-whiteflawless diamonds between...three and eight carats.Total value to be not less thanpresent market price.After we haverecovered the container...and verified its contents...you will be notified onradio frequency 16.23 megacycles...where the atomic bombsmay be recovered.Kenniston, you'd better get onto De Beers at once.Yes, sir.Well, gentlemen,unless those bombs are found...I'm very much afraidwe'll have to pay their price.- Sir?- Oh, yes.Signal from 007 in Nassau.One or two thingsthat might interest us.The Disco Volante is still in theharbor, lying off the casino channel.The catamaran is there too,so we can use it for cover.That's fine. You can drop mein the water behind her.- Any further news from London?- No.Zero hour is still- That's just 55 hours from now.- Yes. Shall we go?- Okay, this will do here.- We'll meet back at Pinder's.Good luck.Turn the underwater lights on.TV, closed-circuit!Hand grenades.Ready.Down there.There!Hey, there's something there!Look! Must have hit himwith the propeller.Let's get back and tell Largo.- Can I have a lift?- Sure.Thank you.You just about saved my life.My outboard capsized,so I had to swim ashore.How far do you go?You better fasten your safety belt.What's your name?James Bond.Fiona Volpe.- Do you fly here often?- Do I make you nervous?No, it's just thatI have no desire...to be capsized twice in one night.At least you won'thave to swim ashore.Have you been here before, Mr. Bond?No, I haven't.But this is the road to Nassau?Yes, eventually.- Well, this is as far as I go.- Me too. This is my hotel.- What a coincidence.- Yes, so convenient.You look pale.I hope I didn't frighten you.You see, I've alwaysbeen a nervous passenger.Some men just don't like to be driven.No, some men just don't liketo be taken for a ride.Look at this.An underwater hatch.Yeah. So that's howthey could leave and get back.Yes, and nobody saw them.Obviously the whole operation...was carried out underwater.That's where we'll have to lookfor the plane. Come on.I'll bring the printsto the hotel when they're dry.Don't forget the Air Force searchedthe area 250 miles out of Nassau.It must be beyond that radius.That's if the Disco Volantewas out that night.Sure she was, but harbor controlsaid for only six hours.She couldn't cover 500 milesin that time, no.About 90 miles is her limit forsix hours, and that's out and back.I reckon we've got to go further out.We'll need more gas for that.All right.Let's get back to Nassau.- We haven't got much time.- You're right, we haven't.Pull!Of course they are watching us.What else have they to do?- You would like Bond dead?- I can think of no better arrangement.Because he tries to make loveto your woman?Because he is Bond, and as an enemyof Spectre, he should be killed.Mark!If Bond had died last nightas a result of your hastiness...his government would have knownfor certain that the bombs are here.When the time is right,he will be killed. Pull!I shall kill him.A separate pool.For sharks, no less. Move in.Hold on that line.That's Largo's place, all right.My next port of call.- Mr. Largo?- Yes, sir.Thank you.- Can I help?- Why, Mr. Bond.- Of course you can.- That looks particularly inviting.- Welcome to Palmyra.- It's a pleasure.I just hope I'm notinterrupting anything.- What do you mean?- I thought you had another visitor.That gun, it looksmore fitting for a woman.You know much about guns?No. I know a little about women.Mr. Jenni, Mr. Vargas.Mr. Vargas, Mr. Jenni.- Which is which?- I thought you might have met...Mr. Vargas the other night.- Yes, I believe I did.- Drink, sir?- Rum Collins?- Yes.Just about that hour, isn't it?For you? Of course!Vargas does not drink,does not smoke...does not make love.What do you do, Vargas?Every man has his passion.Mine is fishing.What is yours, Mr. Bond?Well, I'm not what you'd calla passionate man.I think it's time I went to change.You must let me show you around.- I'd love that.- I thought you might.Pull!- What could be easier?- Perhaps you would call one for me?- Of course. Pull!- It seems terribly difficult.No, it isn't, is it?I collect big game fishfor various marine institutions.Magnificent creatures!Charming.The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.The most savage, the most dangerous.They know when it's timefor them to be fed.- That boat, is she yours?- Yes. I'm very proud of her.What does she do, about 15 knots?Better than that. Near 20.- Perhaps you'd like to see over her?- Yes, I would very much.- Lunch is ready.- Thank you, my darling.Come along, Mr. Bond.The conch chowder smells delicious.Domino, I was just thinking.As I'll be busy this evening,perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough...to take you to the Jankanoo,our local Mardi Gras.You'll be my guest tonight.- That's very kind of you.- It will be my pleasure.Our Mr. Bond must havea very high opinion of himself.Opinion?Yes. He has a date with me too.Excuse me.- Let me go!- Over here.Don't let her make so much noise.Use the chloroform.Largo did promisehe'd come, didn't he?He'll be here. Don't worry.I think that man is waving at you.Come down here.Quick!Excuse me for a second.- James, Paula's gone!- What do you mean, gone?She just checked out of the hotel.You look after Domino. Watch her.- Do you think she was onto something?- I don't know, but I gotta find out.- You watch out for her.- Right.All right. Thank you.The governor's not very happy,but you'll have...a power cut as requestedall over the island.I don't give a damnabout the rest of the island.- I want the lights out in Palmyra.- You'll have it.What do you mean, she won't talk?Don't worry, she will.What's wrong?- Is it a power failure?- Yes, all over the island.Switch overto the emergency generator.Largo told you to be careful.I didn't kill her.She must have taken some poison.A capsule in the mouth.What do you think, cyanide?She's dead.Ricardo, someone's got him!Search that way!And you, the shark pool!- What happened?- I don't know.Leave him! This way!Stop it!You fools! He's gotyou all shooting at each other!Over here!No! I've got a better idea.Lift the tunnel hatchand let them eat.Yes, sir.Sorry, old chap.Better luck next time.Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.I'll get back to him as soon as I can.- Anything else?- Tell him Paula's dead.Aren't you in the wrong room?Not from where I'm standing.Since you're here, would you mindgiving me something to put on?Anyway, I'm very glad to see you again.I'm glad to see you again.I had the feelingyou've been avoiding me.I had no idea thatwe were next-door neighbors.They just moved me downthis afternoon.It's extraordinary, isn't it?Almost as if...As if it was intended.Yes, it is extraordinary.Shouldn't you get outof those wet clothes?You'll catch your death of cold.Look, you knowwe're going to be too late.- Too late for what?- The Jankanoo.I promised my friendsI'd meet them there.Perhaps you know them, the Largos.Questions. All I get is questions.But the music is gonnago on all night anyhow.Enough to drive you wild.Do you like wild things?Wild. You should belocked up in a cage.This bed feels like a cage.All these bars.Do you think I'll be safe?You made a shocking mess out ofmy hair, you sadistic brute.Will you zip me up, please?No wonder you canget dressed so quickly.On the way, we can have a little talk.You may find it interesting. Come on.I'm coming.I hate to thinkI'm gonna miss anything.And now we can go somewherefor an interesting talk.Friends of yours, no doubt. Come in.You dress quickly too.I didn't see that gun in the mirror.Not that it matters, but thatwas under the pillow all the time.When did you find out?You're wearing the same ringas Largo.- It's a ring I like to wear.- Then it has its dangers.Vanity, Mr. Bond.- It's something you know so much about.- My dear girl.Don't flatter yourself. What I didthis evening was for King and Country.You don't think it gave meany pleasure, do you?But of course.I forgot your ego.James Bond, who only hasto make love to a woman...and she starts to hearheavenly choirs singing.She repents and immediately returnsto the side of right and virtue.But not this one.What a blow it must have been,you having a failure.Well, you can't win them all.We'll take him out the front way.Go and get the car.Careful, Mr. Bond.Now what?Get through to Palmyra and tell themwe've been held up by the Jankanoo.- Like to have a drink, man?- Get him away!- Don't you try anything now.- Get out of here!- It's real firewater.- Get out of here!After him! Get him!You haven't seen anything?Look!Follow him. You that side, you there.Stay with us.- Thank you, I'd love to.- Love to what?- You're mad. Do you know that?- Yes. Isn't everyone?May I cut in?You should have told meyour wife was here.Do you come here often?It's no good trying to escape.I don't want to escape.Strange as it may seem,I've grown accustomed to your face.Why don't you come with us quietly?You don't seem to understand.You see, I enjoy my dancing.Do you mind if my friendsits this one out? She's just dead.You'll leave here at 0600 hoursand land at Aden to refuel.You will then proceedto the Megui Archipelago...to make your drop precisely at...20 degrees north,The diamonds will bein a special container.I hate to give in like this.Paying the blood money,letting them beat us.- Have you an alternative suggestion?- I'm afraid I haven't.Your man, 007,I thought he was on to something.- I thought so too, sir.- False alarm?- I'm afraid so.- He obviously has...a highly developed sense of,shall we say, drama?If 007 thoughthe was on to something...It's a great pity he didn't make surebefore he started to shout the odds.Well, we have exactlyThen I suppose we shall have to pay upand look as happy as we can. Shan't we?Well, that's it, James.We've looked about everywhere.We've got to find that plane.You won't find it down there.That's the Golden Grotto.- Golden Grotto?- Yeah. All you'll find...down there are sharks.Take her down. I want a closer look.- At what?- Never mind! Take her down, quick!Set her down.I think we've found it.There's something camouflageddown there. I'll take a look.Shoot one of those sharks.It'll keep the others occupied.I don't know how long the otherswill take before they finish him off...- but they'll be back.- I'll keep an eye on them.Good.- She's down there, all right.- Are the bombs on board?- No.- Great. What's our next move?We'll check on the Disco Volante.If the bombs aren't aboard her now,they soon will be.Who are you going to ask, Largo?No, I don't think we'll have to.I hope we didn't frighten the fish.Ow! Sea egg spines.They're poisonous!Here, give me your arm.Sit down.Now turn over.This is going to hurt a bit.It's the first time I'vetasted women. They're rather good.You're the only manto ever make me cry.Except perhaps Francois,my brother, when we were children.Domino, I have to tell you something.I'm sorry, James. I didn't meanto embarrass you, speaking of love.- I must hurt you again.- You're going away?So sorry, my dear, but it's all over.No, it's about your brother.What about him?He's dead.What happened?It's a long story,and it involves your friend Largo.I need your help.Of course.That's why you made love to me.Look, I can't explainwhat this is all about.- But you must trust me.- Because you want me to help you?Largo had your brother murdered,or it was on his orders.Hundreds of thousands of peoplewill die very soon...if you don't help me.That much we do know,but there's something we don't...The bombs, when they're being loadedaboard the Disco Volante.- How could I know that?- That you'll have to find out.It won't be easy.It could be very dangerous.What can he do to mehe hasn't already done?Then you'll do it?- Yes.- Good.This is a Geiger counter.You press this lever.If it starts clicking,it means the bombs are aboard.- What do I do then?- Go straight up on deck.As the Disco Volante is being watched,you'll be spotted.Vargas, behind you.Really?He must have followed us.I think he got the point.It should have been Largo.Largo? When did he expect you back?Very soon now. He said not to be late.He was most insistent.You better go straight back. I'll takecare of Vargas and everything here.Understand I'm doing this formy brother, for what he did to him.But promise you will kill Largofor me, whatever happens.- We haven't much time.- All right.Oh, something I remembered.It may not be important.- Tell me. Everything's important.- There's a small bridge over the canal.Largo never allows strangersto go near it.By the canal there's a flight of steps.- Where do they lead to?- Down into the sea...on the far side of Palmyra.Perhaps it is important after all.Put on your equipment.Did we get a message saying the girlwent on board the Disco?Yes, sir. Signal received at...- If she is on board, where is 007 now?- That's the question.Stand by. Five seconds.Watch my signal.- Prepare to get underway.- Aye, aye, sir.Captain, weigh anchor.Get underway immediately.Once we pick up the merchandise,head for our target area, Miami.The Disco Volante's leaving, sir.- I told you to stay in your cabin.- It's stuffy in there.- I want a breath of air.- My dear, did you not hear me?- Where did you get that?- I bought it this morning.- Let me see.- No. Why should I?Mr. Bond gave you this little toy,I imagine, and Vargas is dead.No, my dear.There is no escape for you.Like your friend,you've been a little too clever.And now you are caught!You have given memuch pleasure, Domino.But in return, unless you tell mehow much Bond knows...I'll be forced to cause you great pain.This for heat, these for cold.Applied scientifically and slowly.Very, very slowly.- What do you want?- We're activating the bombs.- You said you wanted to be told.- Oh, yes.A private little matter betweenthe young woman and myself.Go!Do not live in hope, my dear.There is no one to rescue you.Now go on!It's a good thingthe homing capsule he swallowed...is still working.Straight ahead.Go right.That's him!Hold it!Up.Get your radio manon to Orlando Beach.Warn them the target is Miami.Also, the bomb is transferredfrom the Disco Volante...onto a wreck off Fowley Point.Right. Hang on to that.And the kitchen sink.On you, everything looks good.Take this.Good luck.- Weigh anchor!- Aye, aye, sir.- Make smoke.- Making smoke now.- Stand by for conversion.- Standing by.Jettison cocoon.Cocoon's away.Keep firing! They're closing!Fire more, more!Wait a minute.We've still got one bomb aboard.He's gone mad!Please talk to them for me.Tell them that I only did whatI had to do, what I was told to do.- Where is he?- The bomb cannot be exploded now.I threw the arming deviceinto the sea.- Do you understand?- Yes.Get him!- I'm glad I killed him.- You're glad?- Who's he?- I don't know, but he helped me.- Look out! The rocks!- The reef!He's jammed the controls!Come on!- Come on, now, jump!- I never learned to swim!Never too late to learn.Get down!Up.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=thunderball-james-bond-007\",\n",
       " \"So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.Particularly on such short notice.lf you can't trust a Swiss banker,what's the world come to?Bon!And now that we're all comfortable......why don't you sit down?It was not easy......but I have retrieved the money.No doubt Sir Robert will bepleased to see it again.At the current rate of exchange,minus the fees and certain......unforeseeable expenses.Voila, the receipt.Would you like to check my figures?I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.It's all there.I didn't come for the money.The report Sir Robert bought was stolen......from an MI6 agent who was killed for it.I want to know who killed him.-Terrible tragedy.-I just want a name.I am merely the middleman.I'm trying to do the honorable thing......returning the money to its rightful owner.We know how difficultthat can be for a Swiss banker.I am offering you the opportunityto walk out with the money.And I'm giving you the opportunityto walk out with your life.Looking at our present situation......as a banker, I'd have to say......that the numbers are not on your side.Perhaps you failed to take into account......my hidden assets.You've had a small reversal of fortune.-Give me the name.-I can't tell you.Let's count to three.You can do that, can't you?One.Two.All right.But you'll have to protect me--James.Have you brought mea souvenir from your trip?Chocolates?An engagement ring?I thought you'd enjoy one of these.How romantic.I know exactly where to put that.Oh, Moneypenny.The story of our relationship:close, but no cigar.I hate to tear you away from affairs of state.Would you mind coming in?Right away, M.Sir Robert King, James Bond.The man who retrieved my money.Thank you. Excellent work.Be careful, M.I might steal him from you.Construction's not exactly my specialty.Quite the opposite, in fact.Best to the family.Old friend?We read law at Oxford together.I always knew he'd conquer the world.Care for a drink?Yes, thank you.He's a man of great integrity.Who buys stolen reportsfor 3 million pounds.Thank you.Any leads on the sniper?Not one.Professional job.She must be working for someone.-Is this the stolen report?-Yes. Classified.From the Russian Atomic Energy Department.What would King want this for?He was led to believethe document was a secret report......identifying the terroristswho'd attacked his new oil pipeline.Interesting.It doesn't explain why someonewould want me out of their office alive.King! The money.Moneypenny, stop King.Move! Move, move!Get out of the way!Stop!Move!Get out of the way! Move!Stop, stop!It isn't finished!Let go!-What do you think you're--?-Let go!Listen to me!You can't get away.We can make a deal.Tell me who's behind this......who you work for.Don't do it!Don't blow us up!I can protect you.Do you understand?I can protect you.Not from him!Hello, my dear.Who is that young woman?King's daughter.Elektra.Thank you.The money was dipped in urea.A highly compacted fertilizer bomb.Having handled the money,the water on 007's hands......when he touched the ice,started a chemical reaction.In one note, the anti-counterfeiting stripwas replaced with magnesium......which acted as a detonator.And King's lapel pin......was switched for a copy......which contained a radio transmitterto trigger the blast.In other words,he set off the bomb that killed him.We know it was someone close to King......and our only leadcommitted suicide on that balloon.But given the size of King's organization......it could be anyone, anywhere. M.This will not stand.We won't be terrorized by cowardswho'd murder an innocent man......and use us as the tool.We'll find those who committed this atrocity.We'll follow them to the farthestends of the earth, if needs be.And we will bring them to justice.Tanner!M says you're off the active-duty listuntil you're cleared by medical.Dislocated collarbone.If any more tendons snap,I'm afraid you'll be out of action for weeks.Molly......I need a clean bill of health.You have to clear me for duty.-That wouldn't really be---Ethical?Practical.Smart.Well, let's just......skirt the issue, shall we?You'd have to promise to call me......this time.Whatever the doctor orders.I suppose if you stayed in constant contact--Of course.If you showed sufficient stamina...-...cut out all kinds of---Strenuous activity?I suppose we all have topay the piper sometime, right, Q?Oh, pipe down, 007.Was it something I said?No. Something you destroyed.My fishing boat.For my retirement......away from you.Now, I want to introduce youto the young fellow......I'm grooming to follow me.Helps to open the door.And you might be...?This is 007.If you're Q, does that make him R?Yes, the legendary 007 wit.Or at least half of it.Now, I dare say, 007,that you've met......your match with this machine.New model? Improved specs?I thought you wereon the inactive roster. Some injury?We'll see about that.As I was saying, the very latestin interception countermeasures.Titanium armor,a multitasking heads-up display......and six beverage cup holders.All in all, rather stocked.''Fully loaded,'' I think is the term.-I think---You're not here to think.You're here to do what I tell you.Now, go put on the coat......and demonstrate it for 007.But of course.Now watch closely, please, 007.The right arm goes in the right sleeve, thus......and the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.Note closely, please:pockets, poppers and zipper.Take the lower part of the zipper......and insert it into--Pull the tag.You said--He seems well-suited for the job.You're not retiring anytime soon......are you?Now, pay attention, 007.I've always tried to teach you two things:First, never let them see you bleed.And the second?Always have an escape plan.Good evening.The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.The Cyprus authorities sayshe has escaped......after shooting deadtwo of her captors and is--He shouted.Shouted all the time.Level one clearance required.Level one clearance required.Yes, 007?Tell me aboutthe kidnapping of Elektra King.I wasn't awareyou had an assignment on this case.I brought the money in that killed King.-Don't make this personal.-I'm not. Are you?You're the only one who could seal her file.Will you excuse us?I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.What happened?After Elektra King was kidnapped......her father tried to deal with it on his own......with no success.So he came to me.As you are aware,we do not negotiate with terrorists.And against every instinct in my heart......every emotion as a mother......I told him not to pay the ransom.I thought we had time on our side.You used the girl as bait.The money in King's briefcasewas the same amount......as the ransom demand for his daughter.It's a message.Your terrorist is back.Victor Zokas.A.k.a....Renard.The anarchist.He was operating in Moscow in 1996.Pyongyang, North Korea before that.And he's been spotted......in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq,Iran, Beirut and Cambodia.All the romantic vacation spots.His only goal is chaos.After Robert came to me,I sent 009 to kill Renard.Before he completed the mission......Elektra escaped.A week later, our man caught up with him.He put a bullet in his head.That bullet's still there.How did he survive?The doctor who saved Renardcouldn't get the bullet out......so Renard killed him.It's moving through the medulla oblongata,killing off his senses.Touch, smell.He feels no pain.He can push himself harder,longer than any normal man.The bullet will kill him......but he'll grow stronger every dayuntil the day he dies.Robert is dead.MI6 is humiliated.He's had his revenge.Not quite.Renard had three enemies in that kidnapping.And there's still one he hasn't touched.Elektra.I see the good doctor has cleared you.Notes you have exceptional stamina.I'm sure she was touched by his dedication......to the job in hand.She's taken over the constructionof her father's oil pipeline.Find who switched that pin.If your instincts are right,Renard will be back......and Elektra will be the next target.The worm on the hook again.She doesn't need to knowthe same man may be after her.Don't frighten her.A shadow operation?Remember......shadows stay in front or behind.Never on top.You, go back. Leave.This area is closed.I'm here to see Elektra King.James Bond, Universal Exports.And I'm Davidov, chief of security.We're having problems with the villagers.I've told Miss Kingto stay at the office in Baku.Oh, hell.-Miss King, I told you to---I know what you told me.Send the pipe around.It's going to take weeks and cost millions.-Your father approved this route.-Then my father was wrong. Do it.-Davidov---I'll talk to her.I saw you at my father's funeral.I'm sorry.M told me she was sending someone.Mr...?Bond.James Bond.Did you know my father?I met him once, briefly.You seem to have inheritedhis touch for diplomacy.Saving the church?And avoiding the bloodshed.discovered the oil here.When the Soviet Union was formed......the Communists spent the next 70 years......plundering our countryside for it.I saw their mess on the drive in.The new pipeline will guarantee our future.But it would be a crimeto destroy what little is left of our past.But you didn't come hereto talk about oil, did you?Tell me......have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?M sent me because your life might be in danger.Please, I want to show you something.I'm trying to buildan 800-mile pipeline through Turkey......past the terrorists in Iraq......Iran and Syria.Up here......the Russians have three competing pipelines......and they'll do anything to stop me.My father was murdered,the villagers are rioting......and you have come all this way......to tell me that I ''might'' be in danger?We suspect there is an insider.My father's pin.No, a duplicate.With a transmitter insidethat set off the bomb.My family has relied on MI6 twice, Mr. Bond.I won't make that mistake a third time.I'm going to finish building this pipeline......and I don't need your help.If you'll excuse me,I have to check the survey lines.I've always wantedto check the survey lines.You don't take no for an answer.I hope you know how to ski, then.I came prepared for a cold reception.Can't land.Wind's too strong.Hold her steady.You ski very well, Mr. Bond.Seems you enjoy being chased.Happens all the time.Less often than you might think.So this is where they meet......the two ends of the pipeline.Your father's legacy.My family's legacy......to the world.-Expecting visitors?-No.This isn't a social call.Head for the gully.I'll lead them into the trees.Go, go!See you back at the lodge.-It's all right.-We're buried alive!I can't stay here!You're not going to.I can't breathe! I can't breathe!Look at me. Elektra, look at me!Look at my eyes.Look at my eyes.Look at my eyes!You're all right.Everything's all right.Trust me.She's fine.Some bumps and bruises,but otherwise fine.She wants to see you.Not you, Davidov. Him.Are you all right?I need to ask you something.And I want you to tell me the truth.Who is it?Who's trying to kill me?I told you, I don't know.But I'm gonna find him.Not good enough.After the kidnapping, I was afraid.I was afraid to go outside.I was afraid to be alone.I was afraid to be in a crowd.I was afraid to do anything at all.Until I realized......I can't hide in the shadows.I can't let fear run my life.I won't.After I find him......you won't have to.Don't go.Stay with me.Please?I can't do that.I thought it was your job to protect me.You'll be safe here.I don't want to be safe.I'll be back soon.And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.Impossible.Vodka martini.Shaken, not stirred.Tell him James Bond is here.Now.I don't think you heard me.Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted to see you.After you.After you.I insist.And a little for you.Bond! James Bond!Meet Nina.And Verushka.Lose the girls, Valentin.We need to talk.Why am I suddenly worried thatI'm not carrying enough insurance?Chill out, James.Fine, ladies.Go on. Beat it. Scram.Bull, give them an inch.And make sure they lose it in this casino.I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.I see you put your moneywhere your mouth is.Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.So what would you like to talk about?I'm not sure I can really help you.I'm a legitimate businessman now.Would you care for some caviar?My own brand: Zukovsky's Finest.Look at this.Russian Special Services.Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.Where did you find this?I took it off a Parahawk which triedto kill Elektra King this morning.Renard is behind this.I think you and I had better have a drink.And then after Afghanistan,the KGB decided......Renard was a liability and just cut him loose.Now he works freelance.But for whom?There are four competing pipelines.I'm willing to bethalf the customers in this casino would be......very happy to see the King pipeline disappear.-What's funny?-Nothing. It appears......Miss King does not share your concern.What are you doing here?The same thing you are.Looking for the people who tried to kill me.Let me take you home. Now.No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.Miss King, how very nice to see you.We've kept your father's chair free.Free? Nothing comes free from you.Your father had a credit line with us.One million U.S.I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.So what's it to be?Blackjack, your father's favorite?Let's keep it simple.One card.High draw.A million dollars.Wait.Bury the top three cards.You're determined to protect me.From yourself. You don't have to do this.There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.Queen of hearts.It appears you've been beaten......by the ace of clubs.No hard feelings, my dear.Come again soon.Shall we?This is a game I can't afford to play.I know.-What happened to Davidov?-I gave him the night off.Welcome to the Devil's Breath.For thousands of years,Hindu pilgrims journeyed to this holy place......to witness the wonder ofthe natural flames that never die......and to test their devotion......to God......by holding the scalding rocks in their hands......as they said their prayers.Tell me, Davidov......what happened this afternoon?You promised me your best men.Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.Yes, but Bond--Bond was unarmed.And you, Arkov?Is everything ready for tomorrow?I have the authorization and passes in the car.I have arranged for a plane tonight, but....But what?We should scrub the rest of the mission.The Parahawks were meant to be returned.People will ask questions, even of me.All because of his incompetence.I see.I see you're right.He should be punished.Davidov, hold this for me.It was wrong of meto expect so much of you.Kill him.He failed his test of devotion.You can take his place.Take his I.D.And do be on time.Poor shoulder.It looks painful.It needs constant attention.I knew....I knew when I first saw you.I knew it would be like this.Enough ice for one day.How did you survive?I seduced the guards.Used my body.It gave me control.And the rest,I got a gun and started shooting.And what about you?What do you do to survive?I take pleasure......in great beauty.Let's go. It's getting late.What happened to Davidov?I was told to expect him.He was buried with work.Let's go. Get your stuff.Okay, come on.Let's get out of here.You're late.Did you bring it?The grease.Of course.Excellent.Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.But make sure you wear the I.D.I'm gonna go get some air.Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.I'm a great admirer of your research.It's not often we seesomeone of your stature here.I go where the work takes me.By the way,you have the transport documents?I pulled the plutoniumout of the one inside.You can detonate the triggers now.Look, our IDA physicist.Don't bother. Not interested in men.Take my word for it.This year we decommissionedfour test sites. Not even a glimmer.Are you here for a reason?Or are you just hoping for a glimmer?And you are...?Mikhail Arkov.Russian Atomic Energy Department.Miss...?Doctor......Jones. Christmas Jones.And don't make any jokes.I've heard them all.I don't know any doctor jokes.This is okay.Take the elevator down the hole.Your friends are already down there.Don't I get some protection?No, Dr. Arkov.Down there it's weapons-grade plutonium.Reasonably safe.Up here we have leaking hydrogen bombsthat your lab built......which I've spent the last six months cleaning up.So if you need any protection at all,it's from me.Your friends are waiting for you.Doctor.Aren't you forgetting?Of course. Thank you.By the way....Expecting Davidov?He caught a bullet instead of the plane.Get off.Keep your mouth shut.You can't kill me. I'm already dead.Not dead enough for me.Show a little gratitude.I did spare your life at the banker's office.That's right.I couldn't kill you.You were working for me.You delivered the money, killed King.Now you brought me the plane.What's your plan for the bomb?You first.Or could it be you don't have a plan?That bomb will never leave this room.Neither will you.How sad to be threatened by a man......who can't grasp what he's involved in.Revenge is not hard to fathomfor a man who believes in nothing.And what do you believe in?Preservation of capital?Go ahead, shoot me.I welcome it.My men will hear the shot and kill you.And the firefight will bring downhalf the army from above.But when a certain phone callisn't made in 20 minutes......Elektra dies.You're bluffing.She's beautiful, isn't she?You should have had her before......when she was innocent.How does it feel......to know I broke her in for you?I usually hate killing an unarmed man.Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.A man tires of being executed.But in your case, I feel nothing......just like you.But then again, there's no point livingif you can't feel alive.-Drop the gun!-Keep away, colonel.He's an impostor.Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.This is your impostor.Along with the men outside on the plane.They'll steal the bomb.I said drop it!On your knees!Well done.He would've killed us all.Did you speak to him?Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.I suppose you were the onewho allowed him down.You had me......but I knew you couldn't......shoulder the responsibility.Without any interruptions, let's proceed.Too many new faces are here,including yours.The bomb doesn't moveuntil I am satisfied.All of you, to the surface, now.Come on! Go!Move!They're sealing us in.Who are you?I work for the British government.Stay calm.No hard feelings, Mr. Bond......but we're even.Soon......you'll feel nothing at all.Seal the door! Close it!Come on!Keep going! Move! Hang on!You're a British spy.Do you have a name?The name's Bond.James Bond.Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!They won't get very far.Every warhead has a locator card.We can track the signal.You mean one of these?Do we have the range of Renard's plane?Anywhere in this circle: Russia......Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan--Sorry to interrupt.Elektra is calling from Baku.It's on the video line.Put her on the wall screen.I'm sorry.I would never call you except......James has disappeared.He left my villa in the middle of the night......and my head of security has been found......near a local airstrip, murdered.I'll send someone out.M, could you come?I can't help thinking......I'm next.Get me out there.Just get me out there.Gabor?Surprised?What's wrong with you?Are you crazy?Maybe.Maybe I should ask you.After all......''There's no point in livingif you can't feel alive.''Isn't that right, Elektra?Isn't that your motto?What do you mean?Or did you steal itfrom your old friend Renard?He and I had a chat.Knew all about us. Knew about my shoulder.Knew exactly where to hurt me.Renard's the man who's trying to kill me?Drop the act.It's over.I don't know what you mean.Oh, I think you do.It's called Stockholm syndrome.Common in kidnappings.Young, impressionable victim.Sheltered.Sexually inexperienced.A powerful kidnapper skilledin torture, manipulation.Something snaps in the victim's mind.The captive falls in love with her captor.How dare you?How dare you?That animal. That monster?He disgusts me.You disgust me.So he knew where to hurt you,is that it?You had a sling on your arm at the funeral.And I didn't have tosleep with you to find that out.He used your exact words.So you knew.You knew all the timehe was out there, coming for me......and you lied.You used me.You used me as bait.And you made love to me.What?To pass the timeas you waited for him to strike?He's struck again.Ten men are dead at the pipeline.I'm coming with you.You do what you want to do,but I've called M.She's coming to take charge.I want an update.Where do we stand?One of Renard's men tookthe locator card from the bomb......so we can't track it. But....But what?With all due respect......I don't think you should be here.May I remind you thatyou're the reason I'm here, 007.You disobeyed an orderand left that girl alone.Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent as you think.-What are you saying?-Suppose the inside man......the one who switched King's lapel pin......turned out to be an inside woman?She kills her fatherand attacks her own pipeline?-Why? To what end?-I don't know...yet.Look at that.That's not right.What is it?An observation rig.Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.Shut it down.I don't understand.It won't respond.The place is clean. No sign of---The bomb is in the pipeline.-Oh, my God!They brought it through here.That'd explain the attack.Heading for the oil terminal.Where it would do the most damage.Have your men evacuate that terminal.So now do you believe me?This is an emergency situation.So please......clear the room. Do it.He's going for the oil.The one pipeline the West iscounting on to supply our reserves.Do you have an idea?Maybe.How far is the rig from the terminal?How fast is it traveling?It's 106 miles from the terminal,going 70 miles an hour.We have 78 minutes.Is there another rig?There's one parkedin the passageway ahead of it.-Charles, can you get me out there?-Of course.Wait a minute. Are you gonna dowhat I think you're gonna do?-What do I need to defuse a bomb?-Me.There it is.Hatch to the passageway.You keep the speed upso the other rig catches up with us.-I'll wait to hear from you.-Gotcha.You know how to drive this thing?Doesn't exactly take a degreein nuclear physics.They're in the pipeline.They're on the move.Faster!If there's the slightest chance,Bond will succeed.He's the best we have......though I'd never tell him.I hope you're right.Here it comes!It's closing up. Faster!Sit tight.No brakes! The controls are jammed!It's a tactical fission device.Low yield. Hold me steady.You've defused hundreds of these, right?Yeah, but they're usually standing still.Life's full of small challenges.Have a look at this.Someone stripped the screw heads.Someone's tampered with the bomb.Look, half the plutonium's missing.So what are you saying?It couldn't go nuclear?There's still enough explosiveto kill us both if the trigger goes off.-Let it blow.-But I can stop it.Let it blow!Trust me. Leave it.Move down. Move down!Jump! Go on, jump!Jump!Robinson's reporting.The bomb was a dud.But the triggering charge blew outa 50-yard section of the pipe.And Bond?Nothing.I'm so sorry.But I have a gift for you.Something that belonged to my father.He would've wanted you to have it.Perhaps this isn't the time.Please.He often spoke of how compassionately......you advised him on the best courseof action during my kidnapping.It's very valuable, you know.I couldn't let it explodewith the rest of him.I was very upsetwhen the money didn't kill both of you.I didn't think I'd get another chance.Then you dropped the answer right in my lap.Bond.And as you say,he's the best you have.Or should I say, ''had''?Take her to the helicopter.Come on, give me your hand.Jump, jump!Do you wanna explain why you did that?I could've stopped it.You almost killed us.I did kill us.She thinks we're dead,and she thinks she got away with it.Do you wanna put that in Englishfor those of us who don't speak ''spy''?Who's ''she''?Elektra King.Why would she blow up her own pipeline?It makes her look innocent.The explosion covers upthe theft of the plutonium.It looks like a terrorist attack.But why leave this half?So there's enough to spread aroundto cover up what they did take.What will they do with the other half?It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.-You're the scientist, you tell me.-I don't know.But the world's greatest terroristrunning around with 6 kilos......of plutonium can't be good.I have to get it back,or somebody will have my ass.First things first.Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?By the way, before we go any further......I just wanna know....What's the story with you and Elektra?We're strictly platonic. Now.Bond to Robinson. Copy?What's your story?What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?Avoiding those kind of questions,just like you.I read you, 007. Red alert.M is missing with Elektra.Three men down.Await instructions. Out.What do we do now?I may have overlooked one critical element.What? More plutonium?Beluga.Caviar.Brought me something?The power to reshape the world.Go on.It's safe.Touch your destiny.I have brought something for you as well.Your present.Courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.My executioner.Overpraise, I'm afraid.-But my people will finish the job.-Your people?Your people will leave you here to rot......just like you left me.You and my father.-Your father---My father was nothing.His kingdom he stole from my mother.The kingdom I will rightly take back.I hope you're proudof what you did to her.I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.When I took her......she was promise itself.You left her at the mercy of a man like me.You ruined her.For what?To get to me?She's worth 50 of me.For once, I agree with you.And now we also share a common fate.You will die......along with everyone in this city......and the bright, starry,oil-driven future of the West.Since you sent your man to kill me......I've been watching time tick slowly away......marching toward my own death.Now you can have the same pleasure.Watch these hands, M.By noon tomorrow......your time is up.And I guarantee you......I will not miss.So beautiful.So smooth.So warm.How would you know?Why are you like this?Because Bond is dead?It's what you wanted.Of course it's what I wanted.He was....He was a good lover?What do you think?I wouldn't feel anything?I feel nothing.What about this?But surely......you can feel this?Remember......pleasure?Wait here.Always something.First the casino.Now the caviar factory.I am a slave to the free-market economy.Bond is alive.Is nothing in this place straight?Who are you?And how did you get in?I'll call security......and congratulate them.Drink?Can't you say hello like a normal person?Get lost.No, no, no. Down the back.What's your business with Elektra King?I thought you were the onegiving her the business.She drops $1 million in your casino,and you don't even blink an eye.What's she paying you off for?You know, if I were you,a relationship with a man like that......I wouldn't bet on it.$5000 of beluga. Ruined.That's nothing compared towhat a nuclear bomb can do.We had a nuclear bomb stolen this morning.Renard and Elektra Kingare working together.-I didn't know.-Well, what do you know?Q's not gonna like this.Get out!Help!Now......where were we?-A rope, please!-No. The truth.She has M.-I know nothing.-Those blades were meant for you.What does Elektra King want you dead for?It was you who destroyed my factory.Then you drown my Rolls-Royce......and now you're tryingto drown me in my own caviar!Let me out!Too bad we don't have any... champagne.Or sour cream.Occasionally......I get equipment for her.Machinery. Russian stuff.And the payoff in the casino?It was a special job.My nephew is in the navy.He's smuggling some machinery for her.-Where?-Absolutely not!Where?-Where?-Istanbul!You!Where have you been,you gold-encrusted buffoon?Sorry, boss.I must have bumped my head.Get me out of here,I'll show you what a bumped head feels like.Look.We have no roof,but at least we have four good walls.The insurance companyis never going to believe this.This used to be the KGB'sIstanbul safe house. Now it's FSB.Federal Security Bureau.Same old friendly service with a new name.-Did you raise Nikolai?-Nothing.Try scanning the emergency frequencies.Tragedy.In the old days, there were 100 places......where a submarine could surface undetected.Submarine?What class is your nephew running?Victor 3, you call it.Nuclear. He's not loading cargo.They want the sub to use the reactor.That's it.Put weapons-grade plutoniumin that sub's reactor......instant, catastrophic meltdown.Making it all look just like an accident.But why?Because the existing pipelinesfrom the Caspian Sea......go to the north. Here.The oil is put on the tankers,shipped across the Black Sea to Istanbul.The explosion would destroy Istanbul......contaminating the Bosporus for decades.There'd be one way to get the oil out.Down south to the Med.The King pipeline.Elektra's pipeline.We must find Nikolai.Captain Nikolai?Sir.Ready to load your cargo.-We have only a few hours.-You came with skeleton crew?-That's all we can afford.-Of course.Some brandy andrefreshments for your men.Thank you.Good morning.What's the time?It's time for you to die.I've got something.On the emergency frequency.Two six-digit numberscycled every 15 seconds.A GPS signal. Position coordinates.Locator card. M.-Here.-Maiden's Tower.Have you been there?No.Mr. Bullion!Bomb!Come on, come on.After you.I insist.Enjoyed your meal, boys?Take them up and throw them in the sea.The extruder's in here.It'll take me half an hour to set upthe machine to make the plutonium rod.Put them in here.The reactor is secured.Everything is complete as planned.-Is your helicopter ready?-It'll pick me up in half an hour.Then this is the end.This is the beginning.The world will never be the same.The future is yours.Have fun with it.James Bond.If only you'd kept away......we might've met again in a few yearsand become lovers once more.Take her to Renard.Pretty thing.You had her too?I could've given you the world.The world is not enough.Foolish sentiment.Family motto.They were digging near here,and they found some very pretty vases.They also found this chair.I think we ignore the old ways at our peril......don't you?Where's M?Soon she'll be everywhere.All this......because you fell for Renard?Five more turns and your neck will break.I've always had a power over men.When I realized my father wouldn'trescue me from the kidnappers......I knew I had to form another alliance.You......turned Renard.Just like you......only you were even easier.I told him he had to hurt me.He had to make it look real.When he refused......I told him I would do it myself.So you killed your father.He killed me.He killed me the dayhe refused to pay my ransom.Was this all about the oil?It is my oil.Mine......and my family's.It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.I'm going to redraw the map.And when I'm through,the whole world will know my name......my grandfather's name,the glory of my people!No one will believethis meltdown was an accident.They will all believe.You understand?Nobody can resist me.You know what happenswhen a man is strangled?Elektra... it's not too late.Eight million people need not die.You should've killed mewhen you had the chance.But you couldn't. Not me.Not a woman you've loved.You meant nothing to me.One......last......screw.Boss......you're alive.So glad to see you.Me too.I'm looking for a sub.It's big and black,and the driver is a good friend of mine.Bring it to me.What a shame.He's just gone.Zukovsky really hated you.Everything's under control up here.Are you ready?Time to say good night.You can't kill me.Not in cold blood.Bond!Call him off.I won't ask again.Call him off.Call him off!Renard.You wouldn't kill me.You'd miss me.Dive! Bond--I never miss.Where is she?Ah, James!Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?Level at 100 feet.Hold her steady.Level at 100 feet.If we can force them up to the surface......they'll show up on the spy satellite......bring out the navy.Come on. Get up!Over there. Move!Move! Go, go!Get over there!Stay!Up!Get us level! Level!It's all smashed!Christmas?So we're going up then?Slight miscalculation.Hold on!Hold on, hold on.Brace yourself.It's flooding!Get up to the hatch.Damn! Come on!Go, go!He's opened up the reactor!And locked himself in!I have to get up there to him.We have one chance.I'll get out and back inthrough the reactor room escape hatch.When the light goes red,press this button so I can get back in.James, it's too risky.If I don't make it......use this chamber to get out.Close the hatch.Exhale all the way up. Close it.Help!Come on, come on!We're safe from the radiation......if the reactor coolant doesn't burst.If he had gottenthe plutonium rod in the reactor......we could've written off the whole city.Welcome to my nuclear family.Are you really gonnacommit suicide for her?You forget, I'm already dead.Haven't you heard?So is she.You're lying.Liar!Liar!She's waiting for you.The hydrogen gas level's too high.One spark and the reactor'll blow.I have to stop it.Go to the top of the sub.Meet me in the torpedo bay.The reactor is flooded.So it's safe even if this place blows.No, it's simply not the case.No. Before that.Any word?No. Still no contact.Always wantedto have Christmas in Turkey.Was that a Christmas joke?From me?No.Never.So isn't it timeyou unwrap your present?Oh, I think so.Look. What's that?-The card.-He must be nearby.Where?-Where?-It picks up......body heat,so humans come out orange.There.I thought you saidhe was with Dr. Jones?It's getting redder.Must be a premature formof the millennium bug.I was wrong about you.Yeah?How so?I thought Christmas only comes once a year.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=world-is-not-enough-the\",\n",

And now.You don\\'t tell mewhat to do.Did you find the manwho hired Gonzales?I\\'m working on it.He\\'s here, isn\\'t he?That\\'s why you\\'re here.Driver, stop! Go back!- I\\'m staying.- So you can put an arrow in his back?You do that, and we\\'ll never find outwho or what is behind all this.It was my parents they killed,not yours. Let me out. Driver, stop!Melina, look at me.You were lucky once,but they are onto you now.The telegram, the motorcyclesback there. They prove it.- Let me handle this.- You? How are you involved?All I can tell you is it\\'s somethingof vital interest to both our countries.More important than my parents?Your father was part of it.He thought it important enoughto risk his life.Now, Melina, please trust me.Go back to the Triaina and wait.Let me find out what I can here,then I\\'ll come straight to Corfu.- I promise you.- Okay.I\\'ll go back and wait,but not for long.It won\\'t be, I swear.Don\\'t they have showersat the ice rink?How did you get in here?One of the porters is a fan.He\\'ll do anything for me,and I\\'ll do anything for you.Well, I\\'m exceedinglyflattered, Bibi...but you\\'re in training.That\\'s a laugh. Everybody knowsit builds up muscle tone.How about building up a little moremuscle tone by putting on your clothes?Don\\'t you like me?I think you\\'re wonderful, Bibi...but I don\\'t think your Uncle Ariwould approve.Him? He thinksI\\'m still a virgin.Yes, well, you get your clothes on,and I\\'ll buy you an ice cream.Shall we?Don\\'t you ever come up for air?That\\'s why I\\'ll get the gold medal--breath control.Yes, well, you can\\'t lose.And now, Erich Kriegler...Iast year\\'s East European champion.There\\'s Erich Kriegler.The East German champion?Isn\\'t he beautiful?You know something, Bibi?You\\'re fickle.Hey, Erich!Come on, let\\'s go watch him shoot.We\\'ll have a drinkat the finish.Well, Bibi, I\\'m afraidI have to leave you.- No, James, stay with me.- I have an appointment.Will you come and say good-bye to meat the practice rink later?Please, James, we\\'re going backto Greece soon.All right, but if I can\\'t make it...all I can say isdon\\'t grow up any more.- Huh?- The opposite sex won\\'t survive it.Won\\'t take long.- Don\\'t play with any of the switches.- Right.What took you so long?I took the scenic route.Tell me more about your boyfriend,Erich Kriegler.He doesn\\'t smoke, he only eats healthfoods and he won\\'t even talk to girls.James, you\\'re jealous.Of course. What else can you tell meabout my rival for your affections?They say he\\'s a defectorfrom East Germany.It is timefor your rubdown.I could eat you up alive.Farewell, Mr. Bond,but not good-bye.I\\'ll be finished around 6::00.Meet me here.How did you know I was here?I radio telephoned the Triaina,and they told me you were coming ashore.I have to go shopping for the crew.Come with me, we can talk.Why not?Thank you.I think you may need that.My father loved the viewfrom here.- I can see why.- We came here often.- Is Corfu your home?- No.My real home\\'s always beenthe Triaina, the Greek islands...Turkey, North Africa--wherever my father\\'s work took us.Did he leave any notes?They could help us.No, I don\\'t think so.To tell you the truth...I haven\\'t had the courageto go into his study since.Try not to think about it now.I\\'m meeting a man tonightat the casino who may give us a lead.You\\'re perspiring, Bunky.Good evening, Contessa.500000Only half?Where\\'s your courage, Bunky?Courage is no matchfor an unfriendly shoe, Countess.Bravo, Bunky.Lucky night.The odds favor standing pat.If you play the odds.Would you cash these infor me, please?Thank you.

I havechampagne and oysters in the fridge.Why not come in for a bite?I won\\'t need you anymore tonight.- Cheers.- Bottoms up.Whoops!Me nightie\\'s slipping.So is your accent, Countess.- Manchester?- Close.Liverpool.It was an amusing performance...between you and the owner of this.What exactly did Columbo whisper to you?That you\\'re a spy.To find out more about you.And have you?Have I ever.When you\\'re ready to leave,you can take my car.That sounds like a dismissal.I was looking forward to breakfast.Lisl, come back!Get in-- Ooh!Goodbye, Countess.What--- What should I do with you?- You cannot just arrest him.You must find a different way.You may have to kill him.- Does this discourage you?- Huh?Just tell me where he is.I\\'m here, Mr. Bondof the British Secret Service.But I\\'ll tell you...it is Kristatos you want, not me.He told you about himself.He\\'s the onewith the powerful connections.Locque works for him,not for me.I smuggle, yes.I smuggle gold, diamonds...cigarettes, pistachio nuts...but no heroin.Sit down.That I leave to him...when he is not too busyworking for Russia...against my country and yours.My country awarded him the King\\'s Medal.Yes, I know.But other people died for it.During the fighting in Crete,he was a double agent.King\\'s Medal.I would laughif my heart was not so heavy...about my poor Lisl.What does Kristatos gainby setting you up?Well, I know too much about him.He wants me out of the way.By using a British agentto do his dirty work for him...your government mightgive him another medal.- Why should I believe you?- I\\'ll prove it to you tonight.We\\'ll go together to his warehouse...in Albania, okay?If I don\\'t report in by morning...not only my people, but the entire Greekpolice will be down on you...Iike a load of bricks.Don\\'t worry.By tomorrow,we\\'ll be good friends.Let us drink to that.I\\'ll wait till tomorrow.You may need this.I\\'m a good judge of men.Mr. Bond, you havewhat the Greeks call tha\\'ros.Guts.So have you, Mr. Columbo.Cheers.Santos\\' drug store.Watch it.J.I.M. diving equipment...for salvage workat depths of over 300 feet.- Raw opium.- An old smuggler\\'s trick.Kristatos knows them all.Get your men out of here.Now.You left this with Ferrara,I believe.Had no head for heights.Where did the St. Georges sink?We can\\'t be sure for certain.We know it was in this vicinity.Your father wasusing the temple as a front.Kristatos killed your father...so he wouldn\\'t findthe St. Georges before he did.Kristatos.How can I help?Where does your fatherkeep his daily log?Daily log.Father and he were pals for 30 years.He repeats everything.- Give us a kiss.- What\\'s his name?Max.Max.Thank you.Hello.It\\'s all shorthand.He used a special kind.Only I could decipher it.He made several surveys in Neptune.- What\\'s Neptune?- Our two-man submarine.He saw a diving bell here.Diving bell?Oil exploration. Kristatos.Three days later,he sighted a wreck in the same area.And?That was his last entry.The day he was killed.Air would be useless at this depth.We need a mixture of oxygen and helium.I have the necessary equipment.The less people that know,the better.I\\'ll give the crew shore leaveexcept for the mate and two others.Let\\'s go.584 feet.An oxygen-helium mix will give useight minutes. We\\'ll have to work fast.Wouldn\\'t the crew have destroyedthe transmitter?Only if they\\'d had the chanceto set the explosive timer.We have a visitor below.Conserve your gas supply.Speak only when necessary.I hope he was dining alone.You better go back to the sub and wait.No, no. I\\'m staying.That should be the command cabin.Eureka!\"Main destruct timer...under lever right of ATAC housing,dualled...by ring main circuitthrough anti-handling charger.\"The destruct timer\\'s setat one minute.For some reason,the lever wasn\\'t pulled.The transmitterwith a thermite charge.Hold these.\"To bypass trembler switch...cut wires in following procedure.\"Cutters.Screwdriver.That\\'s it.Let\\'s get out of here.James, help!- James, I won\\'t make it.- We both will.Get to the sub.I\\'ll stall him.Try and close the CO2.I\\'m trying.Careful, James.It\\'s 5,000 years old.Thank you, Mr. Bond.You have saved usthe trouble of disarming it.Apostis, take that.Where are my men?You will be joining them.Let the girl go.We\\'ll doublewhatever you\\'re getting.I never go back on a deal.It would be badfor my reputation.I will deliver itand return with the money.The voice of the KGB. Our agreementwas that I designate the meeting place.After they pay,I will give them the transmitter.It must not be let out of your sight.Nor mine. Where are we going?We will take the ATACto St. Cyril\\'s.St. Cyril\\'s.I\\'ll arrange the pickup.Bind that wound.We don\\'t want blood in the water yet.Murderer.You have shot your last bolt,Miss Havelock.Leave their legs free.They\\'ll make appetizing bait.I didn\\'t think itwould end like this.We\\'re not dead yet.Hold tight.Turn around. We go again.Take a deep breath.Again. Hurry.Help!Aw, leave him.Turn. Run them down.Follow me.Ahh. The sharks have them.Make port.Thank you.Hello.- Give us a kiss.- Max, not now.Kristatos is still alive.And probably headedto Moscow or Havana by now.We\\'ll never get him.Or the ATAC.ATAC to St. Cyril\\'s.Forgive me, Father,for I have sinned.That\\'s putting it mildly, 007.Your signal sent Whitehall into shock.So far we have managed to locate...439 St. Cyril\\'s in Greece.Heaven only knows to which oneKristatos took the ATAC.I know a well-informed personto contact about that, Q.St. Cyril\\'s, where we used to hidefrom the Germans.Only Kristatos would make an abandonedmonastery his personal retreat.My friend, I\\'ve been studyingthis place...for just such an occasion.We\\'ll split here, huh?Your best approach is on the right face,away from the building.Then you will have to make towardsthe shed on the left...which houses the basketand the electronic winch.It can be operatedonly from the shed.Good luck.Should have brought more people.- James is counting on surprise.- But we are only five men.And one woman.Eighteen...nineteen...twenty.Fifty more.That\\'s the pits! I\\'m supposed tobe skating in Oslo, in lnnsbruck.Why are we in this creepy place?Our plans are changed. We aregoing to live in Cuba for a few months.- Cuba!- You can skate without distractions.I\\'ll be your audience.What a drag.I want to win the gold medal.We all want that.I know what you want.But you\\'re too old for me.I\\'m splitting.- You have poisoned her against me!- Don\\'t blow your top, Ari.- Leave her alone.- I will deal with you...as I deal with everyone who betrays me.Bibi...you\\'re so young.You must have a sponsor.I\\'ll find another one.Go outside and check the guards.Let me know when the helicopter arrives.One of Kristatos\\' killers.- Aah!- Shut him up.Get the door.Come on, George. Let\\'s go.Hurry, unless you want meto go without you.You know,I will never leave you.Your general is late.Only bad weather would delay him.Cover the windows.Let\\'s go.He\\'s all right. Leave him.He\\'s all right.Back!Okay. Let\\'s go.I\\'ll be with you.Sorry.Cover the door!Where\\'s Kristatos?And keep your voice down.We are leaving him.He mustn\\'t know until we\\'re gone.We\\'ll help you if you help us.Come.Where are the guards?That way.Wait here.Move!- Where\\'s Kristatos?- The other side of the courtyard.You better stay here.What have you done to Brink?- Go back to your room!- You can go to hell!Drop it.- Where\\'s Kristatos?- He\\'s left with the ATAC.You\\'re going to pay for it.You\\'re not as fastas you used to be.No, Melina,that\\'s not the answer.We\\'ll turn him overto the Greek police.Out of my way, James.All right...but be prepared to digthose two graves.That\\'s detente, comrade.You don\\'t have it.I don\\'t have it.It seems as though Bibihas a new sponsor.- How\\'s it going?- I\\'ve patched through...a high security lineto the satellite.We can try Bond now.Good. Are you through to Number 10?Standing by, sir.You know what I\\'d like?I can\\'t imagine.A moonlight swim.007, are you there?Bond, are you there?For your eyes only, darling.- He\\'s there.- Patch in the prime minister.I\\'ll get it, Denis.Hello.Mr. Bond on the line,Prime Minister.Ah, Mr. Bond...I wanted to call you personallyto say how pleased...we all are that your missionwas a success, thank you.Thank you, thank you.Don\\'t thank me, Mr. Bond.Your courage and resourcefulness...are a credit to the nation.Denis and I look forwardto meeting you.Meanwhile, if there is anythingI can do for you--Give us a kiss, give us a kiss.Well, really, Mr. Bond.I think we\\'re havinga little trouble with the line, madam.You idiot.Get on to him.007. 007.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=for-your-eyes-only',\n",

What else do you know about me?Marc Ange Draco. Head of Union Corse,one of Europe\\'s biggest crime syndicates.- The biggest.- Not quite.An organisation known as SPECTREoperates worldwide.However, your legitimate business frontsare more extensive.Construction, electrical supplies,numerous agricultural holdings.Your dossier on meis not entirely complete.I am also Teresa\\'s father.- Tracy?- Yes, Tracy. Tracy.My only child.Her mother was an English girl -romantic -who had come to Corsicato look for bandits.Rather like those women who venturedinto the desert looking for sheikhs.She found me in the mountains.Hiding from the police at the time.I came to love this girl.We married. The result: Teresa.Twelve years later my wife died.I sent Teresa to Switzerland- No, thanks. I prefer my own.- To finish her education.Unfortunately I didn\\'t give her a properhome. She was without supervision.Soshe joined the fast international set.One scandal after another.When I disapproved,cut off her allowance,she committed some greater folly.To spite me.Yet, behind her bravado,something was eating away at her soul.This can happen to men and women.They burn the heart out of themselvesby living too greedily.And suddenly,- all is finished.- Why are you telling me this?Without telling me, she married. An Italiancount who killed himself in a Maseratiwith one of his mistresses.I gave her too much,and it brought her nothing.Now, why did I tell you all this?I have been informed of everythingyou have done for my daughter.- Everything?- Don\\'t worry, don\\'t worry about that.What you did, the way you behaved,might be the beginningof some kind of therapy.She needs help.Your help.I find her fascinating,but she needs a psychiatrist, not me.What she needs is a man to dominate her.To make love to her enoughto make her love him.A man like you.You overestimate me, Draco.She\\'s very attractive,but what you ask is not for me.Mm.Listen to me. On the day you marry her,I\\'ll give you a personal dowryof one million poundsin gold.That\\'s quite an inducement.- But I don\\'t need a million pounds.- Stupido!And I\\'ve a bachelor\\'s taste for freedom.Please, just see her some more.Who knows what will come of it?I\\'m sorry, Draco,but in my profession, I can\\'t...- What?- You have connections not open to me.Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?Blofeld?Some of my menhave recently defected to him.- I don\\'t know where he is.- Can you find out?If I could, I wouldn\\'t tellHer Majesty\\'s Secret Service.But I might tell my future son-in-law.Go on.Next week is my birthday.For that,Teresa always comes back to me.- You understand?- Let\\'s say I\\'ll sleep on the idea.You do that.- James! Where have you been?- Much too far from you, darling.Oh, same old James!Ooh! Only more so.Heartless brute! Letting me pine awaywithout even a postcard.Pine no more.Cocktails at my place,eightish, just the two of us.Oh, I\\'d adore that!If only I could trust myself.Same old Moneypenny.Britain\\'s last line of defence.You\\'d better go in.He\\'s running a very tight ship today.I\\'m relieving youfrom Operation Bedlam, 007.But, sir, Blofeld\\'ssomething of a must with me.You\\'ve had two years to run him down.- Have you lost confidence in me?- I\\'m well aware of your talents, 007.But a licence to kill is useless,unless one can set up the target.- Sir...- I\\'ll find you a more suitable assignment.- Under the circumstances...- That\\'s all!That was a quick conference.- How can a girl keep herself alluring...- Take a memo, please, Moneypenny.Ready, James.Sir, I have the honour to requestif you\\'ll accept my resignationeffective forthwith.- Resignation from what?- Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service.And kindly present itto that monument in there.Underneath de mango treeMe honey and mecome watch for de moon...Sorry, ma\\'am.- 007... James Bond here.- He wants you, James.Request granted.Request granted. Not even with regret.What did you expect? A knighthood?Why don\\'t you read it?Two weeks\\' leave!Well, you didn\\'t reallywant to resign, did you?Moneypenny,what would I do without you?My problem is thatyou never do anything with me.It\\'s a date. The moment I get back.- Where are you off to?- Oh, just some place to laze about.Beachcombing.What would I do without you,Miss Moneypenny? Thank you.Bonjour, Miguel.Teresa!It\\'s so long since we see you!- Yes, very well.- There\\'s Tracy.- Huh?- Tracy.Where is she? Ah, there she is!- Teresa!- Happy birthday, Papa.You make it so by being here.You look marvellous.There\\'s someone I want you to meet.- Salut, Olympe.

Teresa.Contessa.- We\\'ve already met.- But each time is a renewed pleasure.Madame always makes one feelso welcome!She likes you, I can see it.You must give methe name of your oculist.Brilliant.I didn\\'t know Mr Bond knew Papa.There are many thingsabout Mr Bond one does not know.It would be interestingto attend night school perhaps.Papa is up to something, I\\'m sure of it.Your father loves you very much, Tracy.Whatever he may arrange,I know it\\'s for your happiness.What has Papa arranged?Ah! Mr Bond.Thank you.- Thank you.- Many happy returns.The best yearsare still to come, let\\'s hope.Oh, allow me.What are you doing here?Yes, wasn\\'t it kindof your father to invite me?Mr Bond and I are discussing business.- Really?- Mm-hm.No woman would waste excellentchampagne discussing business.Unless, of course, she happenedto be part of the arrangement.Olympe, what have you said?Don\\'t blame Olympe.I\\'m not your daughter for nothing.I detect a certain family resemblance.I suggest you revise the termsof your contract, Mr Bond.- You\\'ll find your liability too expensive.- There you\\'re mistaken.- Papa.- Yes?- Mr Bond wants information.- What are you talking about?You always taught mea good host supplies his guest\\'s needs.- Uh-huh.- And without obligation.- And then?- I\\'m not sure obligation is the right word.Tell him, Papa.Tell him what he wants to know.- Now!- Please, please, Teresa.It\\'s only a possibility, nothing definite.Tell him, Papa,or you\\'ll never see me again.All right.There may be a connection betweenthat man Blofeld and the lawyerwith offices in Bern, Switzerland.- Named Gumbold.- Gumbold?- Bern, Switzerland?- Yes, Gumbold.So, now Mr Bond need haveno further interest in me.Another mistake.She always was a headstrong child.I\\'m sorry...Where has he gone?Tracy!Tracy.I was always taughtthat mistakes should be remedied.Especially between friends.Or lovers.We have all the timeIn the worldTime enough for life to unfoldAll the precious things love has in storeWe have all the loveIn the worldIf that\\'s all we haveYou will findWe need nothing moreEvery step of the wayWill find usWith the cares of the worldFar behind usWe have all the timeIn the worldJust for loveNothing moreNothing lessOnly loveI\\'ll see to this appointment,then catch up with you.- The story of our life, James?- Just keep my martini cool.- I will be back in an hour.- Bon apptit, monsieur.Ich hab noch ein paar Sachen zu kaufen.Such things should be left to a girl\\'sfather, who knows what is best for her.But what can be better than being in love?Mr Bond, he\\'s... He\\'s in love with you?That may come too some day.Life\\'s too short for \"some day\", Teresa.Tomorrow I will speak to him alone,man to man.- No, Papa.- Why not?No talk. Whatever happens,there\\'ll be no regrets.Please.Mm.Good afternoon, James.- Afternoon. Is the Admiral in?- Certainly.Hm?Excuse me. Commander Bond to see you.- Right, show him in.- Aye aye, sir.- If you please, sir.- Thank you.Unusually smallfor a Nymphalis polychloris.I wasn\\'t aware that your expertiseincluded lepidoptery.Anyway, what are you doing here?Genealogy, sir. Fascinating subject.Came across a letter from GebrderGumbold, solicitors in Switzerlandto a certainCount Balthazar de Bleuchamp.- De Bleuchamp?- French form of \"Blofeld\".You\\'ve been relieved fromOperation Bedlam, 007. Remember?I assumed you\\'d reassign me, sir.This is a Photostat copy of a letterto our College of Armsin the City of Londonwith the request they try to establishde Bleuchamp\\'s claim to the title,and Sir Hilary Brayhas replied to Gumboldsuggesting that he should meetde Bleuchamp in person.I\\'ve taken the liberty, sir,of working with the college on this,using an examinationof my own family tree as cover.I\\'ve also been reading upon the technical side of heraldry.Sir Hilary Bray, please. Commander Bond.Ah, yes, sir.So that, should he consent to meet, I canact as a representative of the college.Come.- Good afternoon.- Good afternoon, Sir Hilary.Have a look at this: Arms of Sir ThomasBond. Baronet of Peckham. Died 1734.Argent on a chevron sable.Three bezants.Good motto, eh?\"The world is not enough.\"- You\\'re doing a splendid job.- Thank you, Mr Sable Basilisk.We\\'ve traced your lineback to Sir Otho le Bon.Held the manor of Wickhambreux by aknight\\'s fee from the Earl of Thanet, 1387.We\\'re in luck.Gumbold\\'s telephoned from Bernto say his client has consented to see me.- You mean me?- Yes, you.But, Commander Bond, I am only ableto countenance this deceptionif the matter is of national importance.I haven\\'t exaggerated.We appreciate your help.All right, then. I\\'ve arranged to lose myselfamongst the churches of Brittany.I want to do brass rubbings there anyway.- Where do I go for this meeting?- Well, they want a description of myself.- Tactfully adjusted to favour me.- Yes.They will send the time and placefrom where I am to be\"collected\", as they put it.It\\'s not our sort of thing,but under the circumstances...- Sounds as if they\\'re suspicious.- No, no, no, not suspicious. Just discreet.There was no objection to my feeof a thousand guineas.- Could their claim be genuine?- Hard to say. Our methods are exacting.We never speak until we\\'re absolutelycertain there\\'s no error on our side or- forgery on anybody else\\'s.- I hope I live up to your high standards.One helpful physical point may be that thereal de Bleuchamps are without ear lobes.It\\'s not the sort of thing we rely on,but it could help.- No ear lobes.- Invite him to Augsburg.The de Bleuchamps have beencoming from there for generations.Yes, I\\'d like to get himaway from Switzerland.- Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet?- The same, dear lady.I\\'m Frulein Irma Bunt,personal secretary to the Count.- Have you had a good journey?- No, intolerable. I\\'m not a good traveller.I\\'m sorry.- Grunther will take your luggage.- I can manage.- I take it.- Oh, very well.You know Switzerland?- I\\'m afraid not, Frulein...- Bunt.Bunt. Interesting name for a genealogist.Are you from a naval family?Naval?It\\'s a nautical term, you see, meaningthe baggy or swollen parts of a sail.- Nothing personal, of course.- Interesting.- You speak German?- I\\'m afraid not.- French?- A little. Where are we off to?You will not be disappointed. Please?Like the bugs in the rug, yes?- You are comfortable?- Yes, indeed, Frulein.- Your kindness is quite overwhelming.- Good.Hup! Komm!Komm. Komm. Hop!So, we are halfway.Now we will have a little flight.- I\\'ve never been in one of these before.- You must your pipe knock off.Knock out, you mean?I hope.- Mind your head, Sir Hilary.- Please fasten your safety belt.Now up into the Alps.That is avalanche damage.You enjoy the skiingor the bobsleigh perhaps?I\\'m not a sporting man, Frulein.Even when I\\'m at my best.Do you feel the airsickness?Up to there is for the public, andfrom here upwards it is strictly private.No one, no one at allmay come throughwithout permission from the Count.There is the Bleuchamp Institutefor allergy research.- What kind of allergies?- All of them.Like the hay fever,or the sickness caused by the oysters,or inability to eat meat.The Count is a specialist in this field.- I\\'ll be glad to get my feet on the ground.- Not ground. Ice.Frulein, I should warn you,guns make me very nervous.They\\'re to keep away the spiesfrom the chemical companies.Many times alreadythey have tried to steal our discoveries.Yes, we live in a worldof avarice and deceit.- Here, at least, there\\'s no avarice.- Really?The Bleuchamp Instituteis not for profit, Sir Hilary.The Count does his workfor the sake of mankind.Mm, I\\'m very happy to hear it.He wants to leave his markon the entire world.- Characteristic ambition.- Characteristic?- Of a true humanitarian.- Ah!Formerly it was a sports club,open to the public.Now it belongs to the Count,who has given it to scientific research.Josef, Sir Hilary Braywill take number four.I will show you there after Gruntherhas taken you for a medical examination.- I\\'m quite all right now.- You are our honoured guest, Sir Hilary.And after your experiencein the helicopter,we must make surethat you are well again.- Grunther, take Sir Hilary to Dr von Sant.- Ja, Frulein.Direktor, bitte.- Yes?- Der Englnder ist gekommen.- Provide him with the usual comforts.- Ja.You have ten minutes.- And then take them to number four.- Ja.If you wish anything for your comfort,you must ring this.- And the attendant will come.- Very considerate. Thank you.You must also ring for himto open the door- when you wish to leave.- A complicated arrangement.To stop patients leaving their roomsand disturbing each otherwhen they should be resting.The Count believes very stronglyin undisturbed rest.Prudent fellow. When can I see him?We have a lot to discuss.He will send for you, Sir Hilary,when he\\'s ready.Meanwhile, I should like you to join mein the Alpine room before dinner.- Alpine room?- Yes.Grunther will come for you.Shall we say seven?Thank you.Frulein Bunt will receive you.Tomato juice with lots of lemon.Hm-hm!Ah, Sir Hilary!Please, come to meet our patients.Ladies, this is Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet.- How do you do?- He\\'s a famous genealogist.- You will have a drink, yes?- Please, come and sit down.How do you do?Thank you.- What is a baronet?- It\\'s a kind of inferior baron.- Oh, how disappointing.- Well, er...Oh, I don\\'t mean you\\'re inferior,I mean the title is.Yes, but what\\'s a gynae... genealogist?What is that?- Pommy word for an old people\\'s doctor.- Ah! So he\\'s here to cure Frulein Bunt.Watch out. She has ears like an elephant.- What will you drink, sir?- Malt whisky and branch water, please.I\\'m sorry I was so rudeabout what a baronet is.You gave a very accurate description.- Sir.- Thank you.It\\'s a treat having a man here for once.- Er, you mean there aren\\'t any others?- Only the staff, and you can\\'t count them.We will not discuss affairs of the clinic.But what is a genealogist?Will nobody tell me?- It would be a pleasure to tell you.- Well?Genealogy is all aboutancestors and families.I mean, it could easily bethat any one of you hereis related to a royal house.If only we could go backfar enough to find out.If you tell me your names...We do not use surnames here.It is a rule of the clinic.Oh, I\\'m so sorry. I didn\\'t know that.Come, it\\'s time for dinner.Our schedule is rather strict.So is our diet.Sir Hilary, if you would sit there,between Helen and Ruby.I\\'m afraid I\\'ve never hadmuch to do with young ladies.I have ordered you a steak \"Piz Gloria\".- I hope you enjoy it.- Thank you. I\\'m sure I will.- Are you here for Christmas, Sir Hilary?- Er, well, I might be.- Oh, good! Then we can have a party.- That sort of thing\\'s not quite in my line.Delicious!I used to hate chicken.Used to make me break out.It was all over.You\\'d be surprised where.- Potatoes did it to me. Now I adore them.- No medical histories, please.Girls, I\\'m sure Sir Hilary would like to tellus about the College of Arms in London.Go on, Sir Hilary, please tell us.- If you\\'d really enjoy that.- Please. Yes!Would you?- Fascinating!- Tell us all about it.The Herald\\'s College,or College of Arms,consists of 13 membersof the royal household,appointed by the sovereignto run armorial, genealogical,- ceremonial and other matters.- Mm-hm.The 13 membersare divided into three categories:Kings, heralds and pursuivants.Their titles and officesare of great antiquity....when I tell you the first Clarenceux,King-of-Arms, was created in 1334and the first Somerset herald in 1448.Now, when we authorise a coat of arms,it can include all sorts of funny things.Crescent moons, portcullises,beasts couchant and rampant,bars, bezants...Please, what is bezant?Gold balls.I brought a book on the subject. There\\'sa picture of my own coat of arms,which includes four of them,If you\\'d care to see them.I\\'d love to. I\\'m in room...No, no! He will give the book to me.I will pass it to everyone in turn.- It is fairer like that, yes?- Of course. If you think so, Frulein.Is anything the matter, Sir Hilary?Just a slight stiffness coming onin the shoulder.Due to the altitude, no doubt.Der Graf will ihn jetzt sprechen.The Count will see you now.Thank you. Please excuse me, ladies.May all your allergies be swiftly cured.What a nice man!Sweet!Of course, I know what he\\'s allergic to.Bezants.Antisepsis.Please wait here.- Good evening, Sir Hilary.- Good evening.Balthazar, Count de Bleuchamp.If you\\'ll forgive me,that\\'s what I\\'m here to find out.To confirm, Sir Hilary.There can be no doubt of the truth.Please, sit down.If there were no doubt,the college would not have sent me.Well, since you are here,I\\'ll make everything very plain to you.To begin with,I was born without ear lobes.A well-known congenitaldistinction of Bleuchamp ancestry.Like the Hapsburg lip,or the hawknose of the Medicis.Granted, but the factyou\\'re of de Bleuchamp ancestrydoesn\\'t make you the reigning count.I feel it in my blood and in my bones.The college will requiremore concrete proofs.And it shall have them.I have all the relevant documents:Title deeds, certificates of birth and death.They\\'ll be sent to your roomfor authentication.And you\\'ve only to ask Frulein Buntfor anything at all you may require.- Are you comfortable here?- Yes, but puzzled by your clinic.Well, the methods of the great pioneershave often puzzled conventional minds.I have devised a cure for allergieswhich depends on holdingan unusual and rather delicatepsychological balance.So, you see, I must imposespecial conditions on my patients.And, erm, your laboratories?The cure is not entirelypsychological, Sir Hilary.There are vaccines to be prepared.Vaccines which must be modifiedto suit each individual case.So, you see, I\\'m a very busy man.I might not be able to spare youas much time as I might wish.If you wish to be confirmed as the Count,you must give me some of your time.I need details of living relatives,your parents and grandparents.- The documents you will see...- Can answer many questions, but not all.Oh, one more thing.- Could you accompany me to Augsburg?- Augsburg?The ancestral homeof the de Bleuchamp family.There are notable Bleuchamp tombs, andimportant records in the city archives.If you yourself were there to assist...That may not be convenientfor some time.But I\\'m determinedmy title shall be recognised.- Proceed with your preliminary research.- I\\'ll be happy to start straightaway.Thank you, Herr Grunther.... alle eingeschlossensind. Der Gast darf nicht gestrt werden.Du hast zwar nichts gefunden,aber bleib wachsam.- Sir Hilary!- Shh...I\\'ve brought you the book.- The illustrated book?- No, don\\'t turn it on.- I want to see the pictures.- But you\\'re a picture yourself.And twice as lovely in the firelight.You are funnyat pretending not to like girls.Well, I don\\'t usually, but you\\'re not usual.That lipstick was an inspiration.So are you.Oh, Sir Hilary!Call me Hilly.Hilly.- What\\'s your name?- Ruby Bartlett, from Lancashire.- Morecambe Bay actually.- How did you get here?Do we have to talk about that now?Ooh!It\\'s true!How did you get here?I had this awful allergy about chickens.My family\\'s got a chicken farm and everytime I did something on it, I nearly died.The specialist said there was a wonderfulSwiss clinic where they cured you freebecause they were researching.Go on.- No, about the clinic, I mean.- Oh!Well, the specialist had memeet Frulein Bunt in Londonand she said I hada very interesting case.How right she was.Oh, Hilly!Oh, bother!No, Hilly.It\\'s part of the cure.Cassette number seven.Number eight.Do you rememberwhen you first came here,how you hated chickens?How you were sickwhen you even saw one?But all that is over now,for I have shown you how foolish it was.And your cure is nearly done.I have taught you to love chickens.To love their flesh, their voice.Yes, your cure is nearly done.- And soon you will go home- Ruby!- To look after the chickens,- Ruby, wake up!Which you love so much.You do love me just a little,don\\'t you, Hilly?Ruby?I must teach youhow to give them special care.I will tell you what to do.- Ruby, wake up!- I will tell you when.I will tell you how.And after you\\'ve done what I teach you,you will forget it for ever.For ever.Hilly, you old devil.It is me, yes?Quite undeniably, yes.How did you get out?With a fingernail file.It\\'s so easy!Mm, I wouldn\\'t know.I come to see the book.The pictures, yes?Oh, jolly good idea.Now, where did I put it?Mm, I had it a few moments ago.- Perhaps if we turn on the light.- No!You\\'re a picture yourself.And twice as lovely in the firelight.- But, Sir Hilary...- Hilly.But I think you do not like girls, Hilly.Usually I don\\'t, but you\\'re not usual.Coming here like thiswas an inspiration, and so are you.Mmm!- You\\'ll need to be.- What you say?I said a miracle our meeting like this.I don\\'t even know your name.I tell you all about myself later.In the morning.Hey!What about a lift to the top?It is not permitted. All is private.Surely there\\'s a restaurant, a sports clubup there. I\\'ve seen them advertised.- It\\'s all closed down.- Since when? I\\'ve seen them advertised.You are mistaken, sir.For many weeks now they are finished.I\\'d still like to get to the top.From here upwards now is forbidden!Private! Closed!All right.Hey!It\\'s my go now.Let go!- Sir Hilary!- Good morning.Good morning, Sir Hilary.Your stiffness of last night, it is all gone?- For the time being.- Then come and do curling with us.- Won\\'t it be frightfully energetic?- No.- We will show you.- You can teach me.Come on, Sir Hilary.We expect great things of you.- We\\'re leaving very soon. I must see you.- Eight o\\'clock tonight.And the man was alone?- Ah! Good morning, ladies.- Morning!Good morning, Sir Hilary,and how\\'s your research?Riveting. And very promising too.I\\'ve never heardanything so ridiculous.Since when is climbinga criminal offence?- Excuse me. Piz Gloria\\'s private property.- The whole bloody Alp?! Ridiculous!There are many signs,and my servant warned you at the station.Your throw, I think it is.No, Frulein! I had my throw.Made a mess of it, I\\'m afraid.That didn\\'t count. You can throw again.- Yes! Go on!- Very civil of you.That doesn\\'t entitle you to shoot at me.- Who the hell are you, anyway?- I am the director of this institute.Oh!You\\'ll be sent down by cable carand you will not trouble us again.What about my clobber? My belongings?- They\\'ll be sent down later.- But they\\'re mine!We have certain ruleswhich must be observed.- The authorities\\'ll hear about this.- Good day, sir.- Director, or Count, as I think I can say.- Yes?I\\'d like the afternoon off,so if the cable car\\'s going down...But you\\'ve already had the morning off.I must have some fresh air.Your ancestors are very hard work.And the College of Armsis being very well paid.- Well, if you put it like that...- I do put it like that.Let me show you what I\\'ve achieved,then we can go to Augsburg.Not over Christmas.The archives will be closed, no?Come, girls. Time for our massage.Girls, that isenough curling for today.- I must see you tonight.- Nine o\\'clock?Ten?Well, back to work.You\\'ve no idea how it\\'s piling up.Ruby? It\\'s me.Hilly.Hilly\\'s so sad that Ruby\\'s leaving.Has that old cow told you...Fancy meeting you here, Frulein!Merry Christmas, 007.- I\\'m Sir Hilary Bray.- Oh, no, no, no, Mr Bond.Respectable baronets from collegesdo not seduce female patients in clinics.On the other hand, they do gettheir professional details right.The Bleuchamp tombsare not in the Augsburg Cathedral,but in the St Anna Kirche.Sir Hilary Bray would have known.A small slip.Takes more than a few propsto turn 007 into a herald.It\\'ll take more than cutting offyour ear lobes to turn you into a count.I may yet surprise you, but I\\'m afraidthat you have no surprises left for me.I know all about your mission, Mr Bond.Your colleague:Such a keen climber, such a brilliantconversationalist. Before he left us.- He reported where I am.- I doubt that.In any case,no one\\'s coming to your rescue.In a few hours, the United Nationswill receive our yuletide greetings.The information that I now possessthe scientific means to control,or to destroy, the economyof the whole world.People will have more important thingsto think of than you.If they believe your threat.Oh, they will. In any case,I have prepared a demonstration.Remember that disagreeable outbreakof foot-and-mouth diseasein England last summer?I shall instruct them, in very convincingterms, exactly how I arranged that.And my capacity has improved since.Allergy vaccines?Bacteria.- Bacteriological warfare.- With a difference.Our great breakthroughsince last summerhas been the confectionof a certain virus omega.- Infertility.- Total infertility. In plants and animals.Not just disease in a few herds, Mr Bond,or the loss of a single crop.But the destruction of a whole strainfor ever, throughout an entire continent.If my demands are not met,I\\'ll proceed with the extinctionof whole species of cerealsand livestock all over the world.Including, I suppose, the human race.I don\\'t think, do you, Mr Bond,the UN will let it come to that.Not after their scientists analyse a sampleof virus omega they have received.Epidemics of sterility.Nothing is born.No seed even begins to sprout.- They\\'ll find an antidote.- Of course!If I give them enough time.They\\'ll have time. Once they\\'re warned,you\\'ll have problems dispensing the stuff.That problem has already been solved.I have been trainingmy own special \"angels of death\".- Those girls?- Those girls. And many others like them.But exactly how?That will remain my secret.And how many millions do youwant for your services this time?This time?This time the price is different. You\\'ll bemore amused when you know what.Meanwhile, I willkeep you here as my guest.You\\'ll be useful in helpingto convince the authoritiesthat I mean what I sayand I\\'ll do what I claim.Come, let me show youto your new quarters.You\\'re likely to be with usfor some time, Mr Bond.So first,a little therapyto soothe your restless nature.Oh,poor fellow. He was restless, too.You perverse British,how you love your exercise.Every year, dozens of amateur climbers,they wind up in the same predicament.A kind of waxwork showfor morbid tourists.Dear, dear me.Now, now, now, now, Mr Bond,you must learn to be absolutely calmbefore we can accept you backinto polite society.Presents!These are for us!Going-away presents.From the Count himself,in appreciation.- I want to open mine now!- Oh, no!It is more funto open them all together, yes?Please sit down.We will wait for the others.Look, pressies!Eggnog on Christmas Eve, just like home!It is a treat for the going-away party.- Your very good health, my dears.- Cheers.It has been so nice to cure you.It has something special in itfor the holy night celebration.... and now you\\'re goingon a journey. A journey home.But first you must rest for a while.Rest.I will tell you when.And I will tell you how.But it must be our secret.Yours and mine. Our secret.After you\\'ve done what I teach you,will you forget it?For ever.And now you may open your eyes again.Each of you has been given a present.Such a prettily wrapped present.Now is the time to open them. Open them.You see?They\\'re beautiful andyou\\'re longing to know what is inside.You may use anything but the atomiser,which you must never touch, never,until I tell you how and where to use it.Open the compact.Adjust the volume control.Every nightat exactly 12 o\\'clock you must be aloneso that you can switch on that receiverand listen for my voice.I\\'ll tell you what to do,I will tell you whenand I will tell you how.After you\\'ve heard what I say, push themirror back to conceal the receiver again.Push it back now.Then close the case.Now rest again. Rest.In a few minutes you will wake up.You will not rememberwhat I\\'ve just told youuntil you return home.Hilfe!Ah!

Feldkirch.- Why are they looking for you?- I suspect they\\'re trying to kill me.Drive on!- No sign of them yet.- Or of someone saying thank you.Thank you, Tracy.You\\'ve got sharp eyes and beautifulear lobes. What were you doingso near Piz Gloria?Now I have a new interest in life.- Winter sports?

I\\'ll open the doors.Sorry about the accommodation,Contessa.We should have rung ahead and booked.If only I\\'d got through to London.- You\\'ll get another chance.- But when?Let\\'s get some rest.We\\'ll push on as soon as we can.At least it\\'s dry.What really went on up there, James?Mm-mm. Her Majesty\\'s Secret Serviceis still my job.But there\\'s nothing you can doabout your job at the moment, is there?Then why are you thinking about it now?I\\'m not.I\\'m thinking about us.Tracy, an agent shouldn\\'t be concernedwith anything but himself.I understand.- We\\'ll just have to go on the way we are.- No.I\\'ll have to find something else to do.Are you sure, James?I love you.I know I\\'ll never find another girl like you.Will you marry me?D\\'you mean it?I mean it.Mr and Mrs James Bond.Of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells.Mm.

My instructions are clear.Sir, destroy the instituteand Blofeld\\'s virus with it.It\\'s been rejected as too risky.Those girls.God knows how many, let alone where.Sir, if we destroy the centre ofcommunication that controls the girls,the girls can do nothing.I have my orders, 007.You have yours.

Gold paint.Gold?All over?She died of skin suffocation.It can happen to cabaret dancers.You should leave a small bare patchat the base of the spineto allow the skin to breathe.- Someone obviously didn\\'t.- And I know who.This isn\\'t a personal vendetta, 007.It\\'s an assignment like any other.And if you can\\'t treat it as such,coldly and objectively,You\\'ve hardly distinguished yourself.You were to observe Mr Goldfinger.Not borrow his girlfriend.Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europeand it\\'s only thanks to Leiterand my diplomatic interventionthat you\\'re not being heldby the Miami Beach police!Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.But I\\'m prepared to continue thisassignment in the spirit you suggestif I knew what it was about,sir.What do you know about gold?Not paint, bullion.I know it when I see it.Meet me here at seven.Black tie.What do you know about gold,Moneypenny?The only gold I know aboutis the kind you wear.You know, on the third fingerof your left hand.One of these dayswe really must look into that.What about tonight?Come round for dinnerand I\\'ll cook you a beautiful angel cake.Nothing would give me greater pleasurebut unfortunately I do havea... business appointment.That\\'s the flimsiest excuseyou\\'ve ever given me!Some girls have all the luck!- Who is she, James?- She is me, Miss Moneypenny,and kindly omit the customary by-playwith 007. He\\'s dining with meand I don\\'t want him to be late.So there\\'s hope for me yet?Moneypenny...Won\\'t you ever believe me?We here at the Bank of Englandare the official depositoryfor gold bullion.Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky,is for the United States.We know the amounts we each hold andthe amounts deposited in other banks.We can estimate what is being heldfor industrial purposes.Thus, both governments can establishthe true valueof the dollar and the pound.Consequently, we are concernedwith unauthorised leakages.I take it you mean smuggling.Yes.Gold, gentlemen, which can be melteddown and recast, is all but untraceable,which makes it, unlike diamonds,ideal for smuggling,attracting the biggestand most ingenious criminals.- Thank you, Brunskill. That\\'ll be all.- Thank you, sir.Have a little more of this...rather disappointing brandy.- What\\'s the matter with it?- I\\'d say it was a 30-year-old Fine,indifferently blended, sir.With an overdose of Bons Bois.Colonel Smithers isgiving the lecture, 007.Gentlemen, Mr Goldfingerhas gold bullion on depositin Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracasand Hong Kong-worth ?0 million.- Most of it came from this country.- Why move it?The price of gold variesfrom country to country.If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $1 10and triple your money.- If you have facilities for melting it down.- And has he?Apart from being a legitimatebullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...No, that\\'s not quite fair.Is, among his many other interests,a legitimate international jeweller.He\\'s legally entitled to operatemodest metallurgical installations.His British one is down in Kent.We\\'ve failed to discoverhow he transfers his gold overseas.And Lord knows we\\'ve tried.If your department can establishthat it is done illegally,the bank can take actionto recover most of his holdings.I think it\\'s time Mr Goldfinger and I met.Socially, of course.I was hoping you\\'d say that.It might lead to a business talk...Mr Goldfinger\\'s kind of business.- I\\'ll need some sort of bait.- I quite agree.This is the only one we havefrom the Nazi hoard in Lake Toplitz.But there are undoubtedly others.Mr Bond can makewhatever use of it he thinks fit.Providing he returns it, of course.It\\'s worth ?,000.You\\'ll draw it from Q branchwith your equipment in the morning.Of course, sir.- Morning, Q.- Morning, 007.This way, please.My, we are busy this morning!It\\'s not perfected yet.- Where\\'s my Bentley?- It\\'s had its day, I\\'m afraid.- But it\\'s never let me down.- M\\'s orders, 007.You\\'ll be using this Aston Martin DB5with modifications.Now, pay attention, please.Windscreen-bulletproof.As are the side and the rear windows.Revolving number plates, naturally.Valid all countries.Here\\'s a nice little transmitting device,called a homer.You prime it by pressing that backlike this. You see?The smaller model is nowstandard field issue,to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.Its larger brother is magnetic.Right. It\\'ll be concealed in the caryou\\'re trailing while you keep out of sight.Receptionon the dashboard here.Audiovisual, range 1 50 miles.Ingenious, and useful too.Allow a man to stop offfor a quick one en route.It has not been perfectedout of years of patient researchentirely for that purpose, 007.And incidentally we\\'d appreciate itsreturn, along with your other equipment.Intact, for once,when you return from the field.You\\'d be surprised at the wear and tearthat goes on out there in the field.- Anything else?- I won\\'t keep you for more than an hourif you give meyour undivided attention.We\\'ve installedsome interesting modifications.You see this arm here?Now, open the top and inside areyour defence mechanism controls.Smoke screen. Oil slick.Rear bulletproof screen.And left and rightfront-wing machine guns.Now, this one I\\'m particularly keen about.You see the gear lever here?Now, if you take the top off,you\\'ll find a little red button.- Whatever you do, don\\'t touch it.- And why not?Because you\\'ll releasethis section of the roofand engage and firethe passenger ejector seat.Ejector seat? You\\'re joking!I never joke about my work, 007.- Ready, Blacking?- Yes, sir.An old member has dropped by, sir.Same handicap as yours.- I wondered if you\\'d rather play with him.- Where is he?- Mr Bond.- Yes?This is Mr Goldfinger.- How do you do?- How do you do?- You can leave now. The first tee is clear.- Fine.- Hawker will caddy for you, Mr Bond.- That\\'ll be splendid.Shall we make it a shilling a hole?- I\\'ll take some tees.- Yes, of course.You must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.He\\'s an admirable manservantbut mute. He\\'s not a very good caddy.Golf is not yetthe national game of Korea.This meeting is not a coincidence.What\\'s your game, Mr Bond?- My game?- You didn\\'t come here to play golf.A 1 940 smelt fromthe Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.- Part of a smelt of 600.- They vanished in 1 944.When the Nazis were on the run.- Do you have access to more?- Yes, from the same source.Interesting.- Two holes to go.- Yes, and all square.Then you have no objectionto increasing the stakes?- No. What do you have in mind?- The bar of gold you have, naturally.- It\\'s worth ?,000]- Oh, I\\'ll stake the cash equivalent!Naturally.Strict rules of golf?But of course.Bad luck, you\\'re in the rough.What a pity. Here it is.No, it\\'s not. He plays a Slazenger 1 .Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.Five minutes are almost up.A lost ball will cost youstroke and distance.I\\'m still training him as a caddy.Successfully, too.Slazenger No.1 .Good.If that\\'s his original ball,I\\'m Arnold Palmer.It isn\\'t.- How do you know?- I\\'m standing on it.Why, you crafty old... !Leave it.- The ball you found, sir?- Yes, Slazenger 7.Let\\'s have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.Like me to mark it or knock it in?Play it.- This for a half.- That\\'s right.One to go, that will be the clincher.Fine.Did you switch \\'em, sir?- Then we\\'ve got him.- If he doesn\\'t notice the switch.- It\\'s your honour, sir.- It\\'s all right.Down in five.I have to sink this to halve the game,right?- You win, Goldfinger.- It seems I\\'m too good for you!You play a Slazenger 1, don\\'t you?- Yes, why?- This is a Slazenger 7.Here\\'s my Penfold Hearts.You must have played the wrong ballon the 18th fairway.We are playing strict rules, soI\\'m afraid you losethe hole and the match.She\\'s a beauty. Phantom IIl, \\'37, isn\\'t she?- You are clever and resourceful, Mr Bond.- Thank you.Perhaps too clever. Twice our pathshave crossed. Let\\'s leave it at that.Didn\\'t our first meeting convince you?I see. You\\'re worried about menot giving you a return game.Both of us know perfectly wellwhat we\\'re talking about, Mr Bond.But I see that it is necessaryto remind you.Oddjob!Many people have tried to involvethemselves in my affairs.Unsuccessfully.Remarkable. But what doesthe club secretary have to say?Nothing, Mr Bond.I own the club.I assume you want the chequemade out to cash.That would be perfectly satisfactory.Goodbye, Mr Bond.I believe this is yours.Can I have your attention, please?British United Air Ferriesannounce the final callfor the departureof their VF400 flight to Geneva.British United Air Ferries announce thedeparture of their VF400 flight to Geneva.Mr Bond!I\\'ve got you booked on the next flightto Geneva, leaving in half an hour.- Thank you very much.- Right, sir.Discipline, 007.Discipline.Are you all right? Here, let me help you.- You know, you\\'re lucky to be alive.- No thanks to you.You should\\'ve pulled over further.Look at them!A double blowout.I\\'ve never seen one of these before.- How could new tyres... ?- A defect of some kind, most likely.I\\'m so glad it\\'s the car and not you.You don\\'t look like a girlwho should be ditched.Never mind that.Please take me to a garage.Certainly.By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...As quickly as possible.- I\\'ll take that.- Yes, of course.What\\'s your name, by the way?Soames. Tilly Soames.Here for the hunting season?I had a case just like that one.It\\'s for my ice skates.Lovely sport.- Where do you skate?- St Moritz.I didn\\'t know there was ice therethis time of the year.There\\'s a garage.Frulein!I\\'ve had an accident.How long will it take?Thank you.They say it\\'ll take 24 hours to getnew tyres. There\\'s a hotel nearby.- Jump in. I\\'ll run you down.- That won\\'t be necessary.I hate to leave you here alone.I can take care of myself.Yes, I\\'m sure you can.Well... don\\'t forget to write.Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.And art requires...In this case, the bodyworkof my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.We dismantle it here.Reduce the gold in this special furnace,which in turn......weighing approximately two tons.I make six trips a year to Europein the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.It would be wiser to suspendyour other activities.Mr Ling, please assure your principalsOperation Grand Slamwill have my undivided attention...Let me go! You\\'re breaking my back!- What the hell are you doing here?- I want to kill him!- Kill who?- Goldfinger.- Well, I want him alive.- I want him dead! He killed my sister!TM. Tilly Masterson.I knew your sister Jill.I know what he did to her.No, you don\\'t! Let me go!- So why did you shoot at me?- I didn\\'t. I was shooting at him!Well, you\\'re a lousy shot.But somebody else around here isn\\'t.Come on.Get in the car. I\\'ll take care of him.Run for that bracken when I tell you.Now!Good evening, 007.My name is James Bond.And members of your curious professionare few in number.You have been recognised.Let\\'s say by one of your oppositenumbers, who is also licensed to kill.That interesting car of yours!l, too, have a new toy, butconsiderably more practical.You are looking at an industrial laser,which emits an extraordinary light,unknown in nature.It can project a spot on the moon.Or at closer range, cut throughsolid metal. I will show you.This is gold, Mr Bond.All my life,I\\'ve been in love with its colour,its brilliance, its divine heaviness.I welcome any enterprisethat will increase my stock,which is considerable.I think you\\'ve made your point.Thank you for the demonstration.Choose your next witticism carefully,Mr Bond. It may be your last.The purpose of our two encountersis now very clear to me.I do not intend to be distractedby another. Good night, Mr Bond.Do you expect me to talk?No, Mr Bond! I expect you to die!There is nothing you can talk to me aboutthat I don\\'t already know.You\\'re forgetting one thing.If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.I trust he will be more successful.He knows what I know.You know nothing, Mr Bond.Operation Grand Slam, for instance.Two words you may have overheardwhich cannot have any significanceto you or anyone in your organisation.Can you afford to take that chance?You are quite right, Mr Bond.You are worth more to me alive.Who are you?My name is Pussy Galore.I must be dreaming.I thought I\\'d wake up dead.Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.I see.I\\'m delighted to be here.And, by the way, where is here?over Newfoundland.That explains the humming.That means you\\'re in Mr Goldfinger\\'sLockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.- And you\\'re his guest.- I\\'m honoured.I never realised he enjoyedmy company that much.I don\\'t suppose it\\'ll be all fun and games.Mei-Lei.Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?Just a drink.A martini, shaken not stirred.- Won\\'t you join me?- Not on duty.I\\'m Mr Goldfinger\\'s personal pilot.You are?And just how personal is that?I\\'m a damn good pilot.Period!Well, that\\'s good news. By the way,- Where is our host?- He flew on ahead.Thank you.Here\\'s to Operation Grand Slam.This should be a memorable flight.You can turn off the charm.I\\'m immune.We\\'ll be landing in Baltimore,our port of entry into the United States,in 55 minutes.Mei-Lei.I would like to arrivemore appropriately dressed.Did any of my luggage survive with me?And my attach?case?Black attach?case damage]when examined. So sorry.Apologies quite unnecessary.Sydney, tell Mei-Leito keep an eye on him.We\\'ll be landing in 20 minutes.Do you want to play it easy...or the hard way?And this isn\\'t a tranquilliser.Pussy, you know a lot moreabout planes than guns.That\\'s a Smith & Wesson .45.If you fire this close, the bulletwill pass through me and the fuselagelike a blowtorch through butter.The cabin will depressurise and we\\'llbe sucked into outer space together.If that\\'s how you want to arrive,you\\'re welcome.As for me, I prefer the easier way.That\\'s very sensible.And there\\'s so much going onaround Mr Goldfinger,I wouldn\\'t dream ofnot accepting his... hospitality.He\\'ll be very glad to see you, too.You like close shaves, don\\'t you?Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.- M here.- Leiter, sir.It\\'s about 007, sir.We picked up his homer signalfrom Friendship Airport, Baltimore,where he\\'s just landed.Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.Registered to our old friendAuric Goldfinger.I\\'m glad he\\'s making progress.Keep an eye on him for us.Bluegrass Field, Kentucky,is their final destination.Don\\'t charge in on himand spoil anything, will you?He\\'s evidently well on top at the moment.- Mr Bond.- Of course.Please.Any time.Thank you.Do mind your step, Captain.Just keep playing it easy.Mei-Lei, will you see everything\\'sall right with Mr Goldfinger?And I\\'ll see you surprisingly soon.- Talented chaps.- They should be. I trained them.Come on.You\\'re a woman of many parts, Pussy.I believe the bourbon and branch wateris rather splendid here in Kentucky.Well, now that we\\'re both off duty,perhaps...Manners, Oddjob.I thought you alwaystook your hat off to a lady.- You know, he kills little girls like you.- Little boys, too.Well?- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.- Good.Your final briefing is tonight.That\\'ll be all for now.Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.Lovely animal, isn\\'t she?Certainly better bred than the owner.Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.Felix!- Maybe we should just drop in on him.- He\\'ll shout if he needs us.They\\'re all here, Mr Goldfinger.Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.That guy Solo\\'s gonna wear a holein his shoes.Yeah, I like this!Gentlemen!Goldfinger, why weren\\'t we told New Yorkand the West Coast were in on this?Look who\\'s talking!I do not do business with Chicago.I thought we hada private business deal to settle.Now I find I\\'m attendinga hoods\\' convention.Goldfinger, I made a delivery.Where is my money?- I made a delivery, too.- You all made the deliveries we agreed.And you owe me one million bucks.I owe each of you a millionin gold bullion.So, pay!Gentlemen,you can have the million today.Or ten millions tomorrow.Did you say ten million?As soon as my bank opensin the morning.Banks don\\'t open on Sunday.My bank will.What\\'s with that trick pool table?- Cover him!- Hey, cover those doors.Turn those lights back on!What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.I don\\'t like being cooped uplike this. What\\'s that map doing there?This is my bank.The gold depository at Fort Knox,gentlemen.In its vaults are $1 5 billion.The entire gold supplyof the United States.Knock off Fort Knox!- Got a key or somethin\\'?- Of a kind.There are 35,000 troopsstationed around there!And who\\'s gonna say boo to them,Goldfinger?- What\\'s going on here?- What is this?- The floor!- What is this? A merry-go-round?Man has climbed Mount Everest,gone to the bottom of the ocean.He has fired rockets to the moon.Split the atom.Achieved miraclesin every field of human endeavour...except crime!The underworldwill applaud for centuries!- Cut the commercial!- Get to the point!It\\'s pointless.The depository\\'s impregnable.- The joint is bombproof, electrified...- Bear with me, please!Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.Larger, better protected perhaps,but nonetheless a bank!It can be... I think the expression isblown.My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!I call it Operation Grand Slam.I have devoted 1 5 years of my life to it.Every detail has beenscrupulously prepared.Every eventuality has been considered.We\\'ll operate on a split-second schedule.Your organisation, Mr Midnight,brought a batch of these canistersacross the Canadian border.They contain Delta 9.- Delta 9? What\\'s that?- An invisible nerve gaswhich disperses 1 5 minutes afterinducing complete... unconsciousnessfor 24 hours.Tomorrow at dawn,the flying circus of my personal pilot,Miss Pussy Galore,will spray it into the atmosphere.Once the population, includingthe military, has been immobilisedmy task force,which Mr Strap and his peoplesmuggled acrossthe Rio Grande from Mexico,will approach Fort Knoxin motorised equipmentalong Bullion Boulevard,which runs past the depository hereand intersects with Gold Vault Road.This fence surrounding the depository,as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.It will be dynamited!My task force will then moveto the main entrance and demolish it.How, may I ask?You made that possible, Mr Solo. Byusing your influence in shipping circlesto bring through customs uninspecteda consignment labelled machine parts.All that will then remain is to descendto the vaults where the bullion is stored.- I\\'ve heard enough.- Let him finish.If you have no objection...I\\'ll take my money now.What\\'s the matter, Solo?Too big for you to handle?We must respect Mr Solo\\'s decision.Excuse me for a moment while I take careof him. Make yourselves comfortable.- How do we get it out?- That\\'s the bit I wanna hear!Yeah, it\\'d better be good!Pussy!Who taught you judo?The gun you took.The gun.The gun, of course.We must have a fewfast falls together some time.Hey, Strap!He\\'s got the right answers.You and me don\\'t even have to be there.The boys can handle everything.Hey, they closed up the fireplace!- I don\\'t like this!- What\\'s going on here?The gas!Such a pity you did not choose to remainwith the others, Mr Solo. However...Mr Bond, I thoughtyou were resting in your quarters.They are delightful.But it\\'s much too nice to stay indoors.I ran into Miss Galoreand she suggested that we join you.Mr Solo, Mr Bond.Another of my distinguished guests.- Hello.- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?- He has a pressing engagement.- Yeah. I\\'d like to get started, Goldfinger.- Boy!- When you gotta go, you gotta go.My plane will get youto New York on timewith your excess luggage.Allow me.My chauffeur\\'s an excellent driver.You will be at the airport in a few minutes.Goodbye, Mr Solo.Some other time, perhaps?Happy landings, old boy.I found him under the model.Operation Grand Slam.I did enjoy your briefing.So did I.He\\'s on the move.Slow down, don\\'t crowd him.Are you blind or something?You missed the turn!They\\'ve turned to the rightjust ahead here somewhere.Where\\'s this old pal of yours headed?Ten\\'ll get you one, it\\'s a drink or a dame.Dead.- Mechanical failure, maybe?- Unless he switched it off.Why would he do that?- Drive to the farm, it\\'s all we can do.- Right.Your share of Operation Grand Slam willmake you a very rich woman, my dear.Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?You\\'ll retire to England, I suppose?No, I\\'ve spotted a little islandin the Bahamas.I\\'ll hang up a sign, \"no trespassing\",and go back to nature.- Yes, Kisch?- Two men in a car with binoculars.Touts looking for racing tips.There\\'s another possibility, however.Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.We were right to spare Mr Bond\\'s lifein Switzerland,if those gentlemen are his friends.Let\\'s convince themhe needs no assistance.For their benefit, Pussy,let\\'s make him as happy as possible.I suggest you changeinto something more suitable.Certainly.Business before pleasure.He wants you.Mr Bond. Sit down, please.Mint julep?- Traditional, but satisfying.- Yes, thanks.Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.You disappoint me, Goldfinger.You know Operation Grand Slamsimply won\\'t work.And incidentallyDelta 9 nerve gas is fatal.You are unusually well informed,Mr Bond.You\\'ll kill 60,000 people uselessly.Ha! American motoristskill that many every two years.Yes, well... I\\'ve worked outa few statistics of my own.$1 5 billionin gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.to load it onto 200 trucks.At the most, you\\'ll have two hoursbefore the army, navy, air force, marinesmove in and make you put it back.Who mentioned anythingabout removing it?Is the julep tart enough for you?You plan to break intothe world\\'s largest bankbut not to steal anything.Why?Go on, Mr Bond.Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agentat the factory?He\\'s a specialist in nuclear fission...But of course!His government\\'s given you a bomb.I prefer to call it an atomic device.It\\'s small but particularly dirty.- Cobalt and iodine?- Precisely.If you explode it in Fort Knox, the......entire gold supply of the United Stateswill be radioactive for......57 years.I apologise, Goldfinger.It\\'s an inspired deal.They get what they want -economic chaos in the West.And the value of your goldincreases many times.I conservatively estimate... ten times.Brilliant.But the atomic device, as you call it,is already, obviously, in this country.Obviously.But bringing it to Fort Knox undetectedcould be risky. Very risky.On the contrary, Mr Bond.The risk is all on your side.If the authoritiesshould attempt to locate it,who knows whereit might be exploded?Perhaps the Polaris submarine pensat New London,Cape Kennedy,near the White House.But we are speculating idly.Operation Grand Slam will be successful.You will be there to see for yourself.Too closely for comfort, I\\'m afraid.Forgive me, Mr Bond,but I must arrangeto separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.As you said,he had a pressing engagement.Very chic, Miss Galore.Don\\'t you agree?Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.I\\'ll join you both later.How about it, handsome?Don\\'t you think it\\'s timewe got to know each other socially?The new Miss Galore.Where do you hide your gold knucklesin this outfit?I never carry weaponsafter business hours.Yeah? So you\\'re off duty?I\\'m completely defenceless.So am I.That\\'s my James!Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.Yes, I\\'m glad you\\'re enjoying it.Too bad it all has to endtomorrow morning.He\\'s quite mad, you know.Well, now. What do we have here?well in hand.Come on, I\\'m bushed.Let\\'s get back to the motel.- You\\'re quite a girl, Pussy.- I\\'m strictly the outdoor type.I\\'d like to thinkyou\\'re not in all of this... caper.Skip it. I\\'m not interested. Let\\'s go.What would it takefor you to see things my way?A lot more than you\\'ve got.- How do you know?- I don\\'t want to know.Isn\\'t it customary to granta condemned man his last request?You\\'ve asked for this.Get up!Certainly.There.Now let\\'s both play.Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!Speed: 220.Wind check: westerly.Champagne leader to Champagnesection. Commence dive... now.Ready for Rockabye Baby.Commence spray on countdown.Five,four, three, two,zero.Champagne leaderto Grand Slam task force leader.The baby is asleep.I repeat, the baby is asleep.We\\'re going home now.Out.Good morning, Mr Bond.For once,you are exactly where I want you.- The bomb\\'s here.- Let\\'s get moving, Brigadier.- Right, Jack, move in.- Move in, commando tactics.Minimum offensive fire until I signalbomb has been neutralised.Minimum offensive fireuntil I signal bomb has been neutralised.Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.Goodbye, Mr Bond.Mr Ling, it is merely timing...He\\'s one of them, so is the girl.I\\'ll get her, you get the door open.We\\'re trapped!The bomb... I\\'ll take the fuse out.Don\\'t be a fool!You can be a hero, I\\'m not!No, no!Keep going! Hurry up!What kept you?You OK, James?Where\\'s your butler friend?He blew a fuse.Three more ticks and Mr Goldfingerwould\\'ve hit the jackpot.- Did you get him?- Not yet, but he won\\'t get far.- And Pussy?- She helped to switch the canisters.By the way,what made her call Washington?I must have appealedto her maternal instincts.Come on, James. Get aboard.You can\\'t keep the President waiting.Special plane, lunch at the White House.How come?The President wantsto thank you personally.- It was nothing, really.- I know that, but he doesn\\'t.I suppose I\\'ll be able to get a drink here.I told the stewardess liquor for three.- Who are the other two?- There are no other two.- Goodbye, Felix.- So long. Good luck.- Thank you, Brigadier.- Good luck.I\\'m glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.Well, congratulationson your promotion, Goldfinger.- Are you going to the White House, too?- In two hours I shall be in Cuba.You have interfered with my plansfor the last time, Mr Bond.It\\'s very dangerous to fire guns in planes.I even had to warn Pussy about it.- By the way, where is she?- I will deal with her later.She is where she ought to be...at the controls.Pussy!- What happened? Where\\'s Goldfinger?- Playing his golden harp.It\\'s no good.Oh, no, you don\\'t!This is no time to be rescued.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=goldfinger-james-bond-007',\n",

That\\'s all, 007.If I found him first, sir,that might change the situation.Dramatically, wouldn\\'t you say?Good day, Bond.Moneypenny, Fairbanks.- Alaska.|- No. Bill Fairbanks, 002.Oh, poor Bill.- I miss him.|- The Man with the Golden Gun didn\\'t.Officially that was never confirmed.Where was 002 when it happened?Beirut, \\'69.In a cabaret with a lady called Saida.Beirut, hm?Moneypenny,|you are better than a computer.In all sorts of ways.But you never take advantage of them.- Miss Moneypenny.|- Yes, sir.Oh, just one moment, darling.Yes, James?Why wasn\\'t Scaramanga|confirmed as the killer?Because they couldn\\'t find the bullet!Darling!Ahmed.Ahmed!Entrez.Good evening.|My name is Bond. James Bond.Your dancing is superb.- Merci.And you are very handsome.Well, I don\\'t usually intrude like this,|but I... I believe we had a mutual friend.- Bill Fairbanks.|- Fairbanks?Yes.I am told you were with himwhen he was rather, er...|rudely interrupted.Ah, \"mais oui\" - Bill!What a terrible night. I will never forget it.- Did you see who shot him?|- No, I was in his arms.- My eyes were closed.|- At least he died happy.The bullet went through him.- Through his back and ended up there?|- No, no, through his neck.I take it out of the wall|before the police arrive.And now it is my lucky charm.I never dance without it.I\\'m sure Bill would have loved that.But let us forget the past.Mm! I was hoping you\\'d say that.Are you staying long in Beirut?Oh, it depends.Clumsy of me.You really do have|a magnificent abdomen.Oh, my perfumes! No!I\\'ve lost my charm!Not from where \"I\\'m\" standing.Taxi? Hotel, mister?No. To the nearest pharmacy.Dumdum bullets like thisflatten on impact|for maximum wounding effect.- Very nasty.|- Yes, I\\'m sure it is.But just tell me|where it was made and by whom.Well, fortunately it\\'s all in one piece.Which leads us to deduce|it was fired from a 4.2 millimetre gun.Colthorpe, there\\'s no such thing|as a 4.2 millimetre gun.The fact that no recognised munitions|manufacturer, military or civil,produces such a bullet|doesn\\'t mean it doesn\\'t exist, 007.Q Branch have been making irregular|calibres for most unusual purposes.- And we don\\'t put markings on them.|- Making identification almost impossible.You mean we can\\'t trace it? You\\'ve|no idea what it went through to get here.I wouldn\\'t go so far as to say that.The workmanship is undemanding|according to our standards.Soft 23-carat gold with traces of... nickel.Hardly ever used in Europe.|Comes from India.Far East?- Why not India?|- Nickel content obviously too low, 007.- Lazar?|- Lazar!Hm. Imaginative.Highly specialised.Yes, I concur.- Well, what the hell is Lazar?|- Not what. Who. Portuguese.- Lives in Macau.|- Chap who made the bullet, 007.I hate to interrupt your dinner,|but does Senhor Lazar live here?Lazar.I was given this address. Does he...Senhor Lazar?My name\\'s Bond. James Bond.An unexpected honour, Mr Bond.Your reputation precedes you.|This way, please.It would be my proudest moment if|I could make something for you, Mr Bond.A rifle, perhaps.Now, here we have|an interesting problem.A custom-built model for a clientwho recently lost two fingers. Please.- Also lost his trigger.|- It is housed in the butt.Squeeze it.The sights are a bit off.You have five fingers. The butt|is balanced for the pressure of three.That is why you were one inch too low.Here you will find only|craftsmanship and quality.Mass production,your Walther PPK, for instance,|I leave to others.What about ammunition?Designed to individual requirements,|whatever they may be.In gold... if I wanted?- I have already done that for a client.|- I know you have.Francisco Scaramanga.My relationship with a client, Mr Bond,|is strictly confidential.Like a doctor. A priest with a penitent.Oh, of course!Yet you make guns|for fingerless hoodlums,bullets for assassins.Mr Bond, bullets do not kill.|It is the finger that pulls the trigger.Exactly!I\\'m now aiming precisely at your groin.So speak or for ever hold your peace.I have never seen him.On a cost-per-bullet basis,|he must be your best customer.True, but unfortunately|he only fires them occasionally.When was the, er... last shipment?This is impossible. I can\\'t...You\\'re quite right.An inch too low.I have just completed an order|for immediate delivery.- Who collects them?|- I swear, I do not know.My instructions are to go to the casino.|I am paid and they vanish.in Hong Kong harbour,one of the busiest ports in the world.passports and landing cards ready,in order to avoid unnecessary delay.of the famous liner Queen Elizabeth,mysterious circumstances in 1971.and on your right, Hong Kong Island.Taxi!Follow that Rolls.Madam, would you be good enough|to move this inverted bedpan?Sorry I\\'m late, James, but your signal|from Macau just reached the office.You\\'re a great help, Goodnight.Now, get on to Licence Bureau|and trace that car. AU 603, a green Rolls.A green Rolls?A green Rolls-Royce.There can\\'t be that many in Hong Kong.Courtesy cars. All green Rolls-Royces|belong to the Peninsula Hotel.You see what a two-year posting|to Staff Intelligence does for a girl?James, it\\'s wonderful to see you.- Where are you going?|- I need some information.The subject under surveillance|is in room 602.I\\'ll buy you dinner, but first|I have official business to attend to.Yes, I saw the \"official business\".Goodnight, would I do that to you|after two years?Yes, you bloody well would!- Please.|- I can manage.You could open a door for me, though.- I open champagne?|- No, it\\'s a surprise.Oh! A surprise!Good afternoon.- A water pistol?|- Pass me that robe.Turn around.Do you always take a shower|with a pistol?Put your hands up and get out of here!- Keep on walking.|- But you haven\\'t answered my question.Reception. Can I help you?This is Miss Anders. Room 602.Put those down!I see why these packets carry|a government warning.Give me that!They certainly can damage your health.- Ow! You\\'re hurting my arm.|- Then tell me where those bullets go.- No, I can\\'t.|- Try!- He\\'ll kill me!|- Who?I can\\'t tell you!Scaramanga.You see what you can do when you try?You work for him?I don\\'t work for him.He\\'s, um... I\\'m his...Oh. So he\\'s a lover too.Only before he kills.Bullfighters do the same thing.|Claims it improves the eye.His eye is on me. Where can I find him?I don\\'t know.I don\\'t know.I said where?!I don\\'t know!|He doesn\\'t tell me everything.I know he has a date|at the Bottoms Up Club tonight.How will I recognise him?- Tall, slim and dark.|- So is my aunt.- Anything distinctive about him?|- Yes, but how can I...He is not like other people. He has three...Oh.Fascinating anatomical titbit, but the most|useless piece of information I ever heard.Unless the Bottoms Up is a strip club|and Scaramanga is performing there.You\\'ll have to do better.He usually wears|a white linen suit, black tie,and jewellery, all gold.You\\'re improving.I don\\'t want you to twist my arm again.I don\\'t want to either.So I\\'ll tell you what you\\'re going to do.You\\'re going to take the bullets|to Mr Scaramanga,because, if he doesn\\'t get them,|he may not show up at the Bottoms Up.And I want him there.- Why should you trust me?|- I don\\'t.But neither will Mr Scaramanga, if he|hears about this interesting conversation.Who knows? He may even use|one of those little golden bullets on you.And that would be a pity,because they\\'re \"very\" expensive.I\\'ll take them to him.Let\\'s drink to that.Bottoms up!- Soda or ginger ale?|- Ginger ale, please.Police! Drop it!Drop it!You\\'re under arrest.Move away from there!If you take the trouble to examine|that gun, you\\'ll notice it hasn\\'t been fired.Anything you have to say,|you can say at the station.I\\'m charging him under Section 473.- I didn\\'t see your identity card.|- You will.Here.- I thought we were going to the station.|- Kowloon side.Kowloon\\'s over there!We\\'re going to the New Territories!Welcome aboard, Commander Bond.This way, sir.Down the hatchway, please.Good evening, sir.Would you follow me, please?It certainly gives you a new slant.What with the Chinese on one side|and the US fleet on the other,down here\\'s the only place|in Hong Kong you can\\'t be bugged.And with current real-estate prices|in Hong Kong, quite practical. Any luck?A Chinese fighter we salvaged.Good evening, 007.Glad to see you\\'re still with us.In future, Commander Bond, if you must|tour the world of Suzie Wong by night,- inform our man here. Lieutenant Hip.|- Sorry, Commander.I had to get you away from the police,|but didn\\'t know how much you knew.Nothing.But I should report, sir, that Scaramanga|does not have a contract on me.He couldn\\'t have missed me tonight.|Instead he hit a chap at a club.- I got a shock when I saw who it was.|- I should think you did.Our missing solar-energy expert: Gibson.Yes. Gibson. He was prepared|to come back under certain conditions.That\\'s why I\\'m here|with Professor Frazier.Lieutenant Hip|was making a preliminary contact.I almost wish that Scaramanga|had a contract on you.Was Gibson cooperative?He wanted to bargain for immunity.|Suggested another meeting in Bangkok.- Why Bangkok?|- I think he worked there for Hai Fat.That name\\'s come up before.A multimillionaire.|Head of Hai Fat Enterprises.All legitimate, as far as we know.What did Gibson|propose bargaining with?A solex. Claimed it was 95% efficient.If he developed a solar cell that efficient,|he solved the energy crisis.So you\\'ve told me.Coal and oil will soon be depleted.|Uranium\\'s too dangerous.Geothermal and tidal control|too expensive. I know all that.- Where\\'s the solex now?|- Solex \"agitator\", sir.\"The\" essential unit to convert|radiation from the sun into electricityon an industrial basis. It\\'s only that size.It won\\'t take long to check out Gibson\\'s|efficiency claim. This is exciting!May I see it, Lieutenant?He showed it to me at the bar|and replaced it in his pocket.And after he was shot,it wasn\\'t there.I looked.Gentlemen, I congratulate you.Instead of getting a perfected solex,we\\'re left with a useless corpse|and no leads.One lead, sir.Assuming Gibson|was killed by Scaramanga,whoever hired him|could afford a million dollars.- Are you suggesting Hai Fat?|- He could afford it.Out of petty cash.A thought has occurred to me.If Hai Fat hired Scaramanga,- it\\'s unlikely that he met him personally.|- Why?If anything had gone wrong,|there\\'s nothing to connect the two.That gives me an idea|as to how to approach him.Q, I\\'ll... need this.- Really, 007!|- Oh, I admit it\\'s a little kinky.You\\'ll take Miss Goodnight with you.- Goodnight, sir?|- After tonight\\'s debacle,an efficient liaison officer|wouldn\\'t come amiss.Thank you, sir.You won\\'t get near Hai Fat.I have relatives in Bangkok.|I have often passed his place.He lives in a house on a mountain|surrounded by guards.No way!|The place is crawling with guards.Have a look.Hai Fat takes his privacy very seriously.I\\'m sure he\\'ll see me.Good morning. How\\'s the water?Why don\\'t you come in and find out?- Sounds very tempting, Miss, er...|- Chew Mee.Really?There\\'s only one problem.|I have no swimming trunks.Neither have I.What are you doing here?Get out!Immediately.I will have you...Please forgive me, Mr Scaramanga.Excuse me, Chew Mee.Bye-ee.You understand my surprise.I thought it was understood.We were never to meet, Mr Scaramanga.I always thought|your abnormality was a myth.Some cults consider it a sign of|invulnerability and great sexual prowess.I\\'ve learned to live with it.Why are you here?Bond. James Bond.- Do I know the gentleman?|- Well, he knows you.Without being immodest, there are few|people in this part of the world who don\\'t.And there are very few people|who haven\\'t heard of Bond.British Secret Service,|007, licensed to kill.He\\'s good, even by my standards.- He was near the Bottoms Up Club.|- A coincidence.I don\\'t believe in them.The man\\'s a menace.|He knows something.Are you suggesting I invest|another million to remove him?That\\'s up to you.I will give it some thought.Since you have chosen to meet me,|perhaps you will dine here tonight.- I\\'ll be delighted.|- Nine o\\'clock, then.Ling Po, see this gentleman out.Don\\'t tell me you saw him?!He even invited me to dinner.He must have found me quite titillating.In due time, I shall be laid to rest|here in my mausoleumafter a useful, happy, long life.And I do not intend|to allow Mr Bond to shorten it.I\\'ll get the car.- You know I\\'d rather be dining with you.|- I understand, James. Please hurry back.I\\'ll ring as soon as I do.|A midnight snack might be just the thing.I\\'ll keep the wine properly chilled.And everything else warm, I trust.Bye-bye!And everything else warm?!I hope you don\\'t mind|giving my nieces a lift.Good evening.Hai Fat\\'s is on the way.I\\'ll drop the girls, come back and wait.Bye-bye. Bye-bye.The name\\'s Scaramanga.|Mr Fat is expecting me.Grislyland.A pleasant evening.Get him! Come on!Stop it!Not here.This is my home.Take Mr Bond to school.Heaven.Definitely heaven.Tashman.Chula.Chula! Chula! Chula!Chula! Chula! Chula!Are you all right?- How did you find me?|- Hai Fat owns this place.Stand back, girls.Forgot to tell you!Their father runs a karate school.Hang on!What you might call|a Mexican screw-up, gentlemen!Pretty lady, 100 bahts.- No, no.|- 80 bahts.Pretty lady, real elephant. 60 bahts.Missy, yesa!Elephant. Bargain, mister. 100 bahts.Elephant! Real elephant.You are very handsome man. 40 bahts.For you, mister, 20 bahts.Sonny, I\\'ll give you 20,000 bahts|if you can make this heap go any faster.- I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to owe you.|- Bloody tourist! 20,000 bahts!Goddamn little brown water hog!Oh, what\\'s the matter, JW, huh?You just try that in \"my\" bayou, boy!|I\\'d haul your ass!Oh, look, JW. I just gotta have me|one of those cute little elephants.Elephants!We\\'re Democrats, Maybelle.If you got your little pointy heads|out of them pajamas,you wouldn\\'t be late for work.I knew it!You pointy-heads has no more idea|of traffic control than a gooney bird!Get your cotton-picking schnoz|out of my pants. Hear now?Boy, you is ugly.JW?Where are you?What do they teach in that school?|Ballet dancing?I find nothing remotely amusing|about Mr Bond\\'s escape.You underestimated him.Even my influence doesn\\'t extend|into the British Secret Service.I shall lie low too.I won\\'t jeopardise a project|in which I\\'ve invested half my fortune,when it\\'s ready to yield billions.- Where will you hide out?|- That does not concern you.Take this.Return it to the plant and|don\\'t leave there without my permission.May I remind you that you work for me.I took you on as a junior partner to be an|occasional convenience. Nothing more.I did not hire you to interfere in my affairs.- Is that clearly understood?|- Oh, yes, very clearly.I now regret having even considered|employing your services,but that is beside the point.Bond doesn\\'t know you\\'re in Bangkok.|He\\'s never seen you, but he knows me.That\\'s the problem.That\\'s no problem.What happened?Mr Fat has just resigned.I\\'m the new chairman of the board.He always did like that mausoleum.Put him in it.Sorry about that, darling. It was Hip.Still no sign of Hai Fat. Every inquiry|gets a polite Oriental brushoff.With the compliments.\"Phuyuck\"?\\'74, sir.- I approve.|- You do?Oh, not the wine. Your frock.Tight in all the right places.|Not too many buttons.Standard uniform for Southeast Asia.The buttons are down the back.Designed by Q, no doubt.|One of them\\'s a suicide pill, I suppose.No. But the bottom one has a homer in it.How original.Per ora e per il momento che verr.\"To this moment,and the moment yet to come.\"In our profession, I\\'m afraid, you never|can count on that moment to come.Who knows where you and I will be|this time next year?Opposite sides of the world, most likely.That\\'s too far apart.Now, if Hip doesn\\'t come up with a lead,there\\'s really nothing very much|for us to do tonight.Or is there?Oh, darling, I\\'m tempted.But killing a few hours|as one of your passing fanciesisn\\'t quite my scene.Phuyuck!Ah! Goodnight. What a pleasant surprise.My hard-to-get act|didn\\'t last very long, did it?I was trained|to expect the unexpected, but...they never prepared me|for anything like you in a nightie.James, I thought|this would never happen.- What made you change your mind?|- I\\'m weak.Don\\'t move!Miss Anders! I didn\\'t recognise you|with your clothes on.I bribed a bellboy to let me in.I\\'ve come to warn you,you\\'re in great danger.I usually am. That\\'s why I use|the old three-pillow trick.Please believe me.|I\\'m risking my life to come here.Well, your concern for my wellbeing|is touching,but puzzles me.- Scaramanga is in Bangkok.|- He was in Hong Kong, but not after me.We\\'ve been through that routine.He\\'s a monster. I hate him.Then leave him.You don\\'t walk out on Scaramanga.- There\\'s no place he wouldn\\'t find me.|- You need a good lawyer.I need 007.Who do you think sent that bullet|to London with your number on it?I did.And it wasn\\'t easy|getting his fingerprint on the note.Forgive me|if I\\'ve been slow on the uptake.Don\\'t you see you\\'re the only man|in the world who can kill him?Now, what gives you that idea?The way Scaramanga speaks about you.- Even has a likeness of you.|- I\\'m flattered.I want him dead.Name your price. Anything, I\\'ll pay it.You can have me too, if you like.I\\'m not unattractive.At last you\\'re starting to tell the truth.I\\'ve dreamed about you setting me free.I\\'ve been dreaming about a solex agitator.Ever heard of one?Perhaps you can have that too.- No, my clothes are in there.|- Get in.- I\\'ll kill that woman.|- Later!Charming.It was an inspiration, sending that bullet.You\\'re late.It was a double feature.What are you doing?Putting my jewellery away.You can come out now.- What time is it?|- Two-ish.Two? You mean|I\\'ve been in here for two hours?All in the line of duty.Duty! I\\'m resigning in the morning!Goodnight, don\\'t let us down.|The Service needs women like you.Well, obviously you don\\'t!Forgive me, darling.Your turn will come, I promise.As soon as she brings me that solex.- For killing Scaramanga?|- If she gets me the solex agitator first.First?James, you must be good.Oh. We\\'ll find out about that|the next time I meet her.She\\'s making the arrangements.Sorry I\\'m late.|Bangkok traffic\\'s worse than Piccadilly.He\\'s made contact.- How\\'s the charm boy doing?|- Need you ask?Meet you outside.Did you bring it?Darling, I left it in your handbag.It must be in here somewhere, dear.|I saw the man in the shop give it to you.Without the ticket, we can\\'t get a receipt.You won\\'t find it in there, Mr Bond.|I looked before you came.I wouldn\\'t do that either. Look behind you.Lower.A gun in a bag of peanuts. How original.|What will they think of next?My name is Scaramanga.|Francisco Scaramanga.I feel I know you, although|I never thought we should ever meet.It\\'s a very great pleasure for me, Mr Bond,|thanks to Miss Anders.You\\'ve a strange way|of showing gratitude.A mistress cannot serve two masters.A difficult shot, but most gratifying.Well, we, er... all get our jollies|one way or another.Mine have always been guns, Mr Bond.When I was a boy|I was brought up in a circus.My only real friend|was a magnificent African bull elephant.One day his handler mistreated him|and he went berserk.Bleeding, dying,he came and found me.Stood on one leg - his best trick -|picked me up and put me on his back.The man emptied the gun into his eye.- I emptied my stage pistol into his.|- An eye for an eye. Nut?You see, Mr Bond,|I always thought I liked animals.Then I discovered that|I liked killing people even more.Keep this. Whatever you do, don\\'t lose it.- I have to help James.|- Something\\'s wrong?- There\\'s a midget with a gun on him.|- A midget?Same one I saw at the Bottoms Up.|The girl is dead. Call the police!Forget the girl. She\\'s replaceable.And I shall find what she stole from me.Personally, I have nothing against you,|so let\\'s hope our paths never cross again.Please don\\'t try to follow me.Your peanut-toting friend back there|wouldn\\'t like it.No, he wouldn\\'t.You want to try one of mine?- Where\\'s the solex?|- With Goodnight.- Where\\'s Goodnight?|- Outside.She must be by the car.Women! Walkie-talkie.- Goodnight, where are you?|- Somebody locked me in a boot.- The midget\\'s car. I\\'m locked in.Number 7543.- The keys!|- I haven\\'t got them.Oh, no.- Oh, I\\'ve got the keys.And I\\'ve got the solex too.Taxi!Stay in there, Goodnight.|We\\'ve got you spotted.Taxi! Taxi!Taxi!- How \\'bout a demonstration, boy?|- Certainly, sir.What the hell is goin\\' on?!Now... I know you!Oh, no.You\\'re that secret agent.|That English secret agent from England.You\\'re chasin\\' somebody.Who are you after this time, boy?|Commies?Let\\'s go get \\'em! I\\'m with you all the way.Uh-oh. I think we\\'ve got trouble.Pull your cars over,|you little brown pointy-heads!I\\'m a peace officer!James? Are you still there?James!Can you hear me? James!All right, Goodnight. Don\\'t panic.- Who\\'s that?|- It\\'s, er...- It\\'s Headquarters.|- Let me talk to \\'em.Hello. This is Sheriff JW Pepper,Louisiana State Police.and tell her I\\'m on a mission.I\\'ve been deputised. Right?Right.Which car are we all chasin\\', boy?Move it! Move it!Get that piece of junk off of the road.They went left, boy.Press that pedal, boy.Where the hell have they got to?You goofed, boy.Nearest bridge is two miles back.Goddamn! What the...What\\'s goin\\' on?|What the hell are you doin\\' now, boy?The bridge is \"that\" way!You\\'re not thinking of...?I sure am, boy!Ever heard of Evel Knievel?Wowee!I ain\\'t never done that before!Neither have I, actually.Let\\'s go get \\'em, boy!You stay put, boy.This is \"my\" department.Glad to see you boys on the ball!Sheriff JW Pepper, Louisiana State Police.Here\\'s my identification.Law Enforcement Association,|American Legion.Me and my partner here,|we\\'re on a secret mission.What the hell you doing?|Give me my wallet back.Doors.You can\\'t do this to me.|I want my wallet back.Take these goddamn bracelets off!I\\'m gonna sue ya for false arrest!|Police brutality. I got connections.I\\'m gonna get the FBI on your ass!|The CIA!Goddamn it,|I\\'m gonna get Henry Kissinger!Now look at me|when I\\'m talkin\\' to ya, boy.What\\'s the matter?|Ain\\'t none of you seen a plane before?James? James, are you still there?Can you hear me?I think we\\'ve stopped.That is really|all there is to report, sir.So, if I heard correctly,|Scaramanga got away.Yes, sir.- In a car that sprouted wings.|- That\\'s perfectly feasible, sir.- In fact, we\\'re working on one now.|- Oh, Q! Shut up.- Miss Goodnight was in the boot?|- Yes, sir.We found the car-plane abandoned|about 200 miles west of Bangkok.- And the solex?|- In Goodnight\\'s handbag, sir.- Where\\'s Goodnight now?|- We don\\'t know, sir.Communications aren\\'t getting the signal|from the homer she has supplied by Q.Rubbish! They\\'re simply|not stepping up the reception to enable...Oh, shut up, Q!Of all the fouled-up,|half-witted operations!- What do you want?|- We\\'ve picked up Goodnight\\'s signal, sir.- Well, that\\'s something.|- But there\\'s something rather curious, sir.Our sector\\'s here,and we\\'re receiving her signal|from somewhere off this coastline here.Now here it is on a much larger scale.That\\'s where she is.|In this group of small islands.That\\'s all we need! Red Chinese waters.We could stray|inadvertently into them, sir.- I could fly low under their radar screen.|- Absolutely out of the question.If the PM gets to hear of this,|he\\'ll hang me from the yardarm.Officially you won\\'t know|a thing about it, sir.There\\'s a small seaplane|approaching your island.Do you want us to take action?No. No, please don\\'t do anything.Yes, it\\'s a...guest I\\'m expecting.No, he won\\'t be leaving.Bonjour, Monsieur Bond.I am Nick Nack.Dom Prignon soixante-quatre.I prefer the \\'62 myself.Still, beats a bag of peanuts.Monsieur Scaramanga|will welcome you personally.Forgive me, Mr Bond.|A vulgar display, but I couldn\\'t resist itbecause I am so delighted|to see you again.A harmless toy.I am, as you can see now,|completely unarmed.Cigarette?We have so much in common|and so much to discuss.We will never have this chance again.Ours is the loneliest profession, so let us|spend a few pleasant hours together.How can I refuse|such a gracious invitation?Splendid. Splendid!Nick Nack, I expect you to surpass|yourself. He\\'s a cordon bleu, you know?By the way, where\\'s Miss Goodnight?Oh, she\\'s around here somewhere.She can\\'t leave,|so she does as she pleases.How do you like my island?A bit off the beaten track.It\\'s rent-free.|I do my landlords an occasional favour.A cosy arrangement.- Servant problem, I suppose?|- Not at all.Nick Nack does for me very nicely.Usually there\\'s just us two,|but guests are no inconvenience.We\\'re entirely self-supporting. We have|every electrical device you can think of.This is an airlock,|as you are doubtless aware.Automatic, of course.Naturally, we have an ample supply|of electricity here.Let me show you.This should run|a few electric toothbrushes.Up here.A solar-energy station.|So this is what it\\'s all about. Ah!Thermoelectric generators|to convert solar energy into electricity.All built by Hai Fat\\'s|construction company, no doubt.Somehow I seem to have inherited it|from him. It\\'s all fully automated.Kra looks after maintenance and security|in here. Nick Nack does everything else.They tell me the electricity|is stored in here... somewhere.Science was never my strong point.Superconductivity coils|cooled by liquid helium.If I were you, I wouldn\\'t stick my finger -|or anything else, for that matter - in there.At 453% below zero, that liquid helium|would break it off like an icicle.You really know|far more about it than I do.I\\'m arranging for countries that can afford|the price to send experts here to see this.But no solex|until the money is in the bank, right?Right.- I have run across similar situations.|- Not what I\\'ve got here.This way the highest bidder|can build hundreds of stationsand sell franchises for hundreds more.He will literally have the sun in his pocket.A monopoly on solar power.The oil sheikhs will pay you|just to keep solar energy \"off\" the market.The thought had occurred to me.This is the collection point.Ah! So that\\'s where it belongs.Our famous solex in the still down there|transmits heat to the thermal generators.It\\'s collected through this?But where is it collected from?|You need the sun.Watch that mushroom-shaped rock.Ingenious, isn\\'t it?The panels lock on to the sun,|then track it automatically.Something like that, yes.Ah. Reflected through this, those panels|must produce a heat of at least 3,500%F.If you say so, Mr Bond.But I do know we can focus the power|wherever we want.

We're pressed for time.I'll... fill you in later, Moneypenny.Aahh!- Minister.- Commander.Good morning, sir.A new pet, Q?If, 007, you'd ever bothered to readany memos sent from my department,you would realise this is a prototypeof a sophisticated surveillance machine.Now we're all hereyou can get on with the briefing, Q.Very good, sir.Gentlemen...A silicon integrated circuit:The essential part of all modern computers.No lecture, Q.We're all aware of the microchip.Until recently, all microchipswere susceptible to damagefrom the intense magnetic pulseof a nuclear explosion.- Magnetic pulse?- Yes, Minister.One burst in outer space over the UKand everything with a microchip in it,from the modern toaster to sophisticatedcomputers and our defence systems,would be rendered useless.We'd be paralysed - at the Russians' mercy.That is why a private defencecontractor came up with this:A chip totally imperviousto magnetic pulse damage.Now - if I place it on the micro-comparatorand compare it withthe chip Bond recoveredfrom the body of 003 in Siberia...- When I bring the two images together...- They're identical.The KGB must have a pipelineinto that research company.It would appear so.Six months ago that company wasacquired by an Anglo-French combine:Zorin Industries.There has been a securitycheck of the plant?A very extensive one. But we have no leads.What about Zorin himself?Max Zorin? Lmpossible.He's a leading French industrialist.A staunch anti-communist withinfluential friends in the government.With due respect, Minister,the leak did occurafter Zorin bought the company.Precisely why I've initiated an investigation.All right, but let's be discreet about it.But of course, Minister.You have exactly 35 minutesto get properly dressed, 007.They round the turn.Just under a mile to race from this point.Come on, Fluke!

Is it here?- You mean the full brother of Pegasus?- Yes.He's the outstanding horse of the sales.He'll be shown last. We expect himto fetch over three million dollars.Sounds quite reasonable.If you need any further assistanceplease call me.Thank you.Steady! Steady, Pegasus, steady.Keep him on a tight rein!- Steady now, Pegasus. Steady.\\xa0J'arrive dans un instant.Dpche-toi.We are now very proud topresent the full brother of Pegasus.This colt is born in the purple.Monsieur Smythe.MonsieurZorin has been detained.He's anxious to meet you at thereception in the chateau gardens later.I look forward to it.- I wish you wouldn't keep wandering off.- I'm sorry, sir.Your driver may stayin the servants' quarters.I'm sure that'll be more than adequate.What do you say, Tibbett?Ahem!- Welcome, sir.

Anything from St John Smythe?- Nothing about the sale, sir.- But I'd hate to be his valet.- You'll have to buck up your ideas.- I'm sorry, sir.- Don't be so damned obsequious.Oh, my Lord.What the devil's wrong with these shoes?- Were they wiped over with an oily rag?- Terribly sorry, sir.You blasted well should be.I don't know how longyou expect to remain in my employ...- Well done, my good man.- Must we keep this up when we're alone?A successful cover becomesalmost second nature.What's all this about Pegasus disappearing?One minute he's in his stall -the next, neither hide nor hair of him.- We should look into it.Well, don't you concern yourself with that.There's the man I saw at the Pegasus stable.- Another wealthy owner?- Who knows?- But she'd bear closer inspection.- We're on a mission.Sir Godfrey, on a missionI am expected to sacrifice myself.Lovely party.Enjoying our little party,Monsieur... St John Smythe?Immensely, immensely. SIN-jun Smythe.Looks as though you'll havea good turnout for the sale tomorrow.May I introduce Miss Sutton?Sheikh Farouk.- Welcome.- Mr Zorin. Main Strike all set?We'll know after the 22nd.- Thank you.- Enjoy yourself.You were looking for something?Yes, I... I was looking for the bar.Come. I will show you.Oh, by the way, the name isSt John Smythe. James St John Smythe.Dr Carl Mortner. At your service.- Hiya, doc!- Good afternoon, Mr Conley.Mr Conley, Mr Smythe.Bob Conley.- Are you a trainer?- Horses? Hell, I can't even ride.- I'm in the oil business.Oh. Texas?Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin'soil interests there.Would you excuse us? Come on, honey.Are you a doctor of medicine?Oh, no, no.I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant.Oh, really?Then you can let me into a little secret.How is it you succeed with breedingbloodlines other experts think inferior?Selective breeding is important.But more importantis conditioning and a desire, ja?Are you talking aboutpeople or horses?My principles apply equallyto human beings.Mr St John Smythe.Allow me to introduce myself.Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure.- A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.- Of course.You will excuse me?I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.Your stables are magnificent.Built in the 16th century by a duke whobelieved he'd be reincarnated as a horse.Have thoroughbreds interested you long?Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dottyold aunt die and leave me some stables.So I thought it might be rather funto breed and raise horses.- I take it you ride?- I'm happiest in the saddle.A fellow-sportsman.What about fishing?Fly casting?I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll findthe young ladies stimulating company.I'm sure they are.Hello. I thought you mightlike to join the party.By the way, the name isJames St John Smythe. I'm English.Hmm. I never would have guessed.Really?Monsieur.Well, are you buying or selling?- Selling?- Horses.Oh.No, I'm not interested in horses.Well, you came to the wrong place,didn't you?May Day.Get her away from him.I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.Have Security keep a good eye on him.You didn't say what partof the States you come from, Miss...No. I didn't.I suppose you... travel a lot?Your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes.You're not staying the night? I was hopingwe'd spend the evening together.Now I shall be all alone.I doubt that.- Well, let me walk you to the chopper.- That won't be necessary.- Someone will take care of you.- You'll see to that personally, will you?- Shhh!Are you looking for this?Quite a letdown.- St John Smythe?- Sleeping like a baby.That's a boy.There we are.It's interesting. He's had surgery.Surgery? That is how Zorin won the race.Mortner implanted one ofthese microchips into Pegasus.You see, these microchips areprogrammed to control an injectionof additional natural horse steroids.- To overcome fatigue during the race.- How?The injection itself, with that small needle,is triggered by a remote-control transmittersmall enough to fit intothe tip of a jockey's whipor a cane.The lights!There's a world surplus of microchipsand Zorin is hoarding them!- Dis donc, on va voir ce qui se passe?- D'accord.- I'm afraid I wasn't much help.- Don't worry. It's all wrapped up.Keep your guard up higher.And retain your balance.- Aiiii!- Oof!- What now?- We'd better get back.The tape ran out five minutes ago.I told you not to disturb us.It's important.There's been intruders in the warehouse.Put Security on full alert.Let's see where Mr St John Smythe is.He was the man at the Eiffel Tower.- We must find him.- I'll get dressed.May Day, where have you been?I've been waiting for you.To take care of me personally.I see you're a woman of very few words.What's there to say?- Is everything here?- Ja, ja.Except this.It is in the wrong place.Bring St John Smythe to my studyfirst thing in the morning.Good morning.- Good morning.I understand you wish to see me.- You slept well?- A little restless, but I got off eventually.I have the Progeny Index on the computer:A compilation ofthoroughbred bloodlines.Might be helpful to you in selectingyour purchase this afternoon.As I see it, you need a stallion. For breeding.A stallion sounds right to me.I find a computer indispensable.I have a stallion.Descended from that horse there.Misty.We have several horsesthat might interest you.Would you be interestedprimarily in stamina?- Or speed?- Well, a little of both would be ideal.I think I have just the horse for you.It's time for my morning ride.- Why don't you try him out?- That sounds a very good idea.- I shall get into some riding clothes.- Good.Half an hour, then. Scarpine will collect you.Thank you.Tibbett, get into town, call Mand ask him to put a trace on this cheque.Be quick. If those guards we laid outidentify us we'll have to move fast.What shall I say if they ask where I'm going?Just tell themyou have to get the car washed.Just going to town to get the car washed.- Your mount, Mr St John Smythe.- A beautiful beast.A little spirited. What's his name?Inferno.Merci.- Friends of yours?- Exercise boys.Jumping together is more realistic training.Frankly, I prefer cross-countryto steeplechase.As one sportsman to another,I'll make you a proposition.You can have that lthacus colt gratisif you stay this course.- And if I'm thrown?- Then you lose.You leave me little choice.Splendid. Scarpine will start us.Steady!Keep going! Keep going!Sir Godfrey. Let's get...You lost, 007.- Killing Tibbett was a mistake.- I'm about to make the same one twice.My department know I'm here.They'll retaliate.If you're the best they have,they'll more likely tryto cover up your incompetence.Don't count on it, Zorin.- You amuse me, Mr Bond.- Well, it's not mutual.Other side.Open up.- Good morning, Comrade Zorin.- General Gogol.- This meeting is ill-advised.- A calculated risk.But necessary,as you refuse to answer your control.Come to the point, General.You disregard procedure.You did not request approvalbefore eliminating 007.- Reprisals might jeopardise operations.- You jeopardise mine!Letting the British penetratethe Siberian research centre.That was regrettable.Your racing activitiesattract unnecessary attention,but more disturbing are yourunauthorised commercial ventures.We cannot tolerate that.The issue is irrelevant.I've made new associations.I no longer consider myself a KGB agent.We trained you. Financed you. Huh!What would you be without us?A biological experiment. A freak.Enough of this! Control yourselves!You will come back to us, Comrade.No one ever leaves the KGB.Gentlemen.For centuries alchemiststried to make gold from base metals.Today we make microchipsfrom silicon, which is common sand.- But far better than gold, hm?For several years we've hada profitable partnership:You as manufacturers, while I passed onto you industrial informationthat made you competitive, successful.We are now in the unique positionto form an international cartelto control not only productionbut distribution of these microchips.There is one obstacle.Silicon Valley.Near San Francisco.Over 250 plants employingthousands of scientists, technicians.This is the heartland of electronicproduction in the United States,which accounts for what -80% of the world microchip market.I propose to endthe domination of Silicon Valley- and leave us in control of that market.- What is it you propose?Project Main Strike.For which, each of you will pay meone hundred million dollars.A hundred million dollars?Plus half our net income?Under an exclusivemarketing agreement with me.These are outrageous terms!Perhaps a demonstrationwould convince you.- I want no part of it, thank you.- As you wish. Hmph!The rest of our discussionmust of course be confidential.- Would you wait outside?- If you'd like me to, yes. Excuse me.May Day will provide you with a drink.This way.Aaagghhh!So, does anybody else want to drop out?Wow!What a view!To a kill.Five dollars.Thank you.- Looking for something special?- Yes. Soft-shell crabs.Might have some in the back.I'll be a few minutes.Chuck Lee, CIA.It's a pleasure working with 007.- Thanks. Now what about Zorin?- He's in town. I can have him tailed.No, not yet.Conley is a geologist. Runs Zorin'soil reclamation project in the East Bay.Last job: Chief engineerin a South African gold mine.Left in a hurryafter a cave-in killed 20 miners.Zorin's kind of man!What about the girl? And the cheque?You know how many S Suttonsthere are in the US?We watch Zorin's account.The cheque hasn't been cashed.- Mortner?- Got a real winner here.His real name is Hans Glaub, a Germanpioneer in the development of steroids.That ties in with the horse injections.In the war he used steroids on pregnantwomen in the concentration campsin an attempt to enhance intelligence.- With any success?- Virtually every mother aborted.A handful of childrenwere produced with phenomenal IQs.But there was a side-effect:They were psychotics.Why wasn't this Mortner or Glaubtried by the War Crimes Commission?The Russians grabbed him.Set him up in a laboratory.He spent years developing steroids fortheir athletes, then vanished 15 years ago.About the same timeZorin came over to the West.Could Zorin be one of the steroid kids?He's definitely the right age,and he's certainly psychotic.What about his oil operations?Mr O'Rourke!Aye!- Can you spare a minute?- Sure thing.The oil operation looks clean, exceptfor a problem with the crab fishermen.Good morning.Here's that reporter I told you about.Mr O'Rourke.I understand you have a problem.That Zorin oil pumping station ruinedone of the best crab patches in the Bay.Scared them away?They didn't go nowhere.They just disappeared.Well, I'd like to look atthat oil pumping station.That'll be tough. It's very heavily guarded.We'll be testing new equipment shortly.Keep a sharp lookout.- I don't want anyone near this dock.- Very good, sir.- Valves 5 to 15 are open.- What's the report from the wells?Valves open and ready to receive water.Good. Open valves 16 to 25.Valve 10 at half capacity, sir.Give me an update on valve procedurefor the Main Strike programme.We'll have a field crewcheck it out in the morning.- Valves to wells 26 to 30 open, sir.- Right.Activate pumping procedure.50 per cent power.Increase it.Maximum.The new seals are not fully tested.Main Strike's in three days. Any delays,I hold you responsible.Yes, sir.Bring it up to full. Slowly.- Shut down! The propeller's jammed.- Fix it.- You there! Get a man down there!Let's go, move. Come on, you guys.Gimme a hand.- Get the alarms turned off.- Yes, sir.Hurry up, goddammit!Clear that pump.We're behind schedule.Give it to me.Ha!Guard!Tell Conley to resume pumping.This is yours, I believe.Defuse it.Aaaggghhh!Well!- Pola lvanova!- James Bond!- Check the beach area.- Let's get out of here.That feels wonderful!Feels even better from where I'm sitting.- Would you like it harder?- James, you haven't changed.Well, you have.You're even lovelier.James, that night in Londonwhen I was with the Bolshoi...What a performance!In my dressing room later...Did you know I was an agentwith orders to seduce you?Why do you think I sent youthree dozen red roses?Now that was a performance.Quite a coincidence,us running into one another!- Come on, tell me the truth.- Let's not talk shop.Let's put on something more...- inspirational.- Why not?- Ohh!Are you all right?The bubbles tickle my...Tchaikovsky!Dtente can be beautiful.This is no time to be discussing politics.Pola?Yes, darling?You know something? TomorrowI shall buy you six dozen red roses.How lovely, darling. I can't wait.The tape?The Silicon Valley operationmust not be delayed.Main Strike's in three days.Any delays, I hold you responsible.It's essential the remaining pipelinesare open on time.Our economy needs investors like Mr Zorin.California welcomes him with open arms.- May I quote you on that, Mr Howe?- Certainly.Is there anything else I can tellthe Financial Times?Yes. My readers want to know why Zorinis pumping sea water into his pipelineinstead of pumping oil out.Sea water is used to testthe integrity of the pipeline.It's a lot safer than oil.Just in case there are any leaks.Well, I... I didn't know that.Well, thank you, Mr Howe.That about wraps it up.Would you come this way, please?If you'd like any further informationjust call me, Mr...Stock. James Stock. Thank you, Mr Howe.- Mr Howe!- Stacey, what do you want?I have some porosity testsI want to show you.- I can only spare a couple of minutes.- OK.\\xa0Ahem!Sorry.Come out real slow.Just another Zorin stooge, Mr...whatever your name was.Actually, it's James Stock.London Financial Times.You can, uh... You can tell the police which.And you can tell them about the $5million payoff you received from Zorin.I saw the cheque.You cut the line.Get back.Sit down.- What's this loaded with?- Rock salt.Now you tell me.No!The vase! No!Take this.Oh, hell!Sorry, Granddad.Hey, wait for me!Thank you.My pleasure.All the king's horses and all his menwon't do much with that.That's all right. It was Granddad's ashes.But he always loved a good fight.I'm Stacey. Sutton.- Yes.- And... you're a reporter.- What was it?- Stock. James Stock.- Right.- Yes, I'm researching an article on Zorin.I used a friend's nameto get an invitation to the chateau.I can tell you a few things about Zorin.- I'd like to hear them.I have to feed him. Are you hungry?- What are you serving? Whiskas?- I only have leftovers in the fridge.- I'm a pathetic cook.- I'll lend a hand.- You can cook?- I've been known to dabble.Et voil! Quiche de cabinet.Sounds interesting. What is it?An omelette.Now, you were telling meabout your grandfather.He left Sutton Oil to Dad - who expectedme, as the only child, to take it over.- So at college I studied geology.- And then what happened?Zorin. He took over Sutton Oilin a rigged proxy fight.I fought him in the courts.It's taken all I had.All the cash, the furniture, everything.So I took this job as state geologistand I've just managedto hold on to the house and my shares.And that's what the $5 million were for?Your shares?Ten times more than they're worth. Just...Just drop the lawsuit and shut my mouth.I haven't accepted yet.So Zorin sent along his gorillasto help you make up your mind.They have.I'd sell everything and live in a tentbefore I give up.That was delicious.And the way you handled those men.Well, those...baboons could come back.I hope not.Well, then, I'll...check the windows and doors, and...- Oh! Reconnect the telephone.- The box is outside my bedroom window.I think I should be able to find that.- Good morning.- Good morning.Oh, I say! Breakfast out of bed.- What's wrong with them?- We had an earth tremor.They're extremely sensitiveto seismic activity.Let's see whatthe Earthquake Center has on it.Just a minor tremor. Measured 2.5on the Richter scale. Location...That's odd.The epicentre's near Zorin's oil field.I told Howe yesterday that Zorinwas pumping sea water into his wells.- Is there a connection?- Sea water?Those wells are in the Hayward fault.- Are you sure?- I checked it myself.That's incredibly dangerous.Howe has to stop Zorin now.- What happened?- I got fired.- He fire... He fired me.- All right. Calm down.This evening we'll meeta friend of mine from Washington.Maybe, just maybe,he'll come up with a few answers.I wish we could be more specific aboutZorin's intentions before I go to the top.Flooding a faultcould cause a major earthquake.But what would Zorin have to gain?On the tape Zorin mentioned Silicon Valley.Could that be affected?No, not severely.Silicon Valley's too far away.But if we knew how many wells wereinvolved... we might get a clearer picture.That information's available at City Hall.- I still have my security pass.- Then let's go to City Hall.- Let me go and get it.- I'll tell Washington we need more help.Don't waste any time. There's only 24 hours.- Good evening, Jeff.- Evening, ma'am.- Won't be long.- OK.- Main Strike.- Hey, I know that place.That's an abandoned silver mineby the San Andreas fault.Alive and well, I see.And still bungling in the dark.Well, then,why don't you enlighten me, Zorin?You're out of your depth.And you, Sutton. You should haveaccepted my more than generous offer.- You can take your offer and shove it.- Don't bother, Stacey.He's a psychopath.You two have joined forces?- That simplifies things.- He's probably armed.Stacey, I...Mr Zorin.Call the police, Mr Howe.- What's going on?- Tell them... there's been a break-in.Ask them to get here as soon as possible.You're being used, Mr Howe.Do it.- Police.- Hello.We've had a break-in here.- City Hall, office 306. Come at once.- Right away.- What have they done?- You discharged her.So she and her accomplicecame here to kill you.Then they set fire to the officeto conceal the crime,but they were trapped in the elevator.And perished in the flames.But that means I would have to be...Dead.That's rather neat. Don't you think?Brilliant.I'm almost speechless with admiration.Intuitive improvisationis the secret of genius.Herr Doktor Mortnerwill be proud of his creation.Please.Get back.- Out.- Let's go.Get back!Hold tight.Come on, Stacey.Give me your hand.

If you can get toHowe's office you'll find him dead.We found him - and this gun. This yours?- Yes, thanks.- Turn around.If you check with Chuck Lee of the CIA,he'll inform you who I am.- We found his body in Chinatown.- What?- You're under arrest.- Wait.This is James Stockof the London Financial Times.Actually I'm with the British Secret Service.The name is Bond. James Bond.- Is he?- Are you?Yes.And I'm Dick Tracyand you're still under arrest.Get in here.Hey, where's that guy goin'?That ladder's unlocked.Is that true what you saidabout the British secret service?Yes, I'm afraid it is.My real name is Bond. James Bond.You must take my word for it.Put your hand on this.The wheel! Take over. Put your foot on here.James, where are you going?To all units. Interceptmurder suspect in stolen fire truck.He may be armed and he's sure dangerous.- Pull away you idiots.- I can't. The fenders are locked!- I told you, they're locked!- Oh, my God, watch out!Ohhh!- Jeez!- Turn!Not this way. That way!Shit!Ohhhh!- Swing me back!- Oh, jeez!Drive on!- I think I can get him.- Go for it!That should keep them on the wrong track.Hello.Raise the bridge? Right now?Yes, sir!I got him.

Except...Except right beneath usis the key geological lockthat keeps the faults from moving at once.Hey, let's go!All those explosives.Would they be enough to break the lock?Of course!If they go off, both faults move at once.Silicon Valley and everything in itsubmerged for ever.If it happened at the peak ofthe spring tide for maximum effect...That's today at 9.41.

Just leave them here.|-\\xa0I\\'m very sorry, but we can\\'t find them.- What do you mean? Who had them last?|-\\xa0Commander Strangways, sir. Both files.All right, Miss Taro. All right.Damn nuisance,|their disappearing like that.On the contrary.I\\'d have been surprised if they hadn\\'t.By the way, that came for you from|London this morning, in the plane,in the diplomatic pouch.A present from home.Can I get out that way?That\\'s a naughty little habit -|listening at keyholes.I wasn\\'t listening.|I was looking for those files.Anything that can\\'t be found,|I get the blame.Oh, forget it.|Actually, it\\'s not very important anyhow.I hate to think of you spending|all afternoon looking for them.No. I have the afternoon off.There\\'s a coincidence. So have I.|Why don\\'t you show me round the island?What should I say to an invitation|from a strange gentleman?You should say yes.I should say maybe.Three o\\'clock, my hotel,maybe?Yes, maybe.Good.The luminous dial activates it.|Here, hold this.Now, where exactly did Commander|Strangways place those samples?- About where your feet is, sir.|Good.Hi, there.Hi- Lose something?|-\\xa0Take a look at this Geiger reading.Those samples Strangways brought back|from Crab Key... were radioactive.Yet Professor Dent told me|they were worthless chunks of iron ore.- He\\'s either a bad professor or a poor liar.|-\\xa0I intend to find out which.Quarrel, how soon can you|get us over to Crab Key?Well... it\\'s like this here, Captain.Commander Strangways,|he done take samples of \"all\" the islands.- We could check the nearest ones first.|- No. I\\'m interested in Crab Key.I done take the commander there.|We got away without trouble.It don\\'t do to tempt providence too often.You see... there\\'s a dragon.- What?|- Native superstition. Started by Dr No, probably.We won\\'t force you to do anything.Leiter and I will go after dark, if you\\'ll|give us the navigational directions.I gets my navigational directions|from my nose, my ears,from my instincts.Anyway, I\\'ll be here about seven.Fine.Oh, Mr Bond!|There\\'s a telephone message for you.Johnny, what have you done with it?It\\'s right here.Hello?Oh, Mr Bond!I was thinking, why don\\'t you|collect me at my apartment?It\\'s lovely up here in the mountains.Nice and cool.All right. You leave the Port Royal Road|out of Kingston,then along the Wentworth Road,|until you get to the cement factory.Then you turn left.Follow the road up the hill,down the other side,Magenta Drive 239.I\\'ll be waiting for you.How did it happen?I think they were on their way to a funeral.Just a minute!You did invite me here, remember?Oh, of course.|I just didn\\'t expect you here so soon.Yes, yes, come in.Uh... I\\'ll just go and put some clothes on.Don\\'t go to any trouble on my account.Please!Forgive me. I thought I was|invited up here to admire the view.I feel one of us should answer it.Hello?Yes.

I know he\\'ll be pleased.Here we are.This will be your room, Mr Bond.This is your bathroom in here.And for you, young lady,this is your room.You\\'ll find fresh clothes in here.I hope they fit.|We didn\\'t get your sizes till last night.Don\\'t hesitate to ring|if there\\'s anything you want.Such as two air tickets to London?I\\'ll leave you two dear people in peace.- Well, let\\'s have some breakfast.|-\\xa0How can you eat at a time like this?I\\'m hungry.

Ready, Honey?I suppose so.You\\'re doing fine.Come on.Am I properly dressed for the occasion?- Quite suitable.|-\\xa0Suitable for what?This way, please.I\\'m glad your hands are sweating, too.Of course I\\'m scared, too.Be natural and leave all the talking to me.In here, please.I hope you enjoy your dinner.Come and look!Artificial light. We could be|hundreds of feet beneath the sea.Look at that. Sea tulips.They do not grow above 200ft.One million dollars, Mr Bond.You were wondering what it cost.As a matter of fact, I was.Forgive my not shaking hands.|It\\'s awkward with these. A misfortune.You were admiring my aquarium.Yes. It\\'s quite impressive.A unique feat of engineering,|if I may say so. I designed it myself.The glass is convex, ten inches thick,|which accounts for the magnifying effect.Minnows pretending they\\'re whales.|Just like you on this island, Dr No.It depends, Mr Bond,on which side of the glass you are.A medium dry martini, lemon peel,|shaken, not stirred.nanOf course. We\\'ll have dinner at once.There\\'s so much to discuss. So little time.Well, Dr No, you haven\\'t done badly,|considering.A handicap is what you make of it.I was the unwanted child|of a German missionaryand a Chinese girl of good family.Yet I became treasurer of the most|powerful criminal society in China.It\\'s rare for the Tongs to trust anyone|who isn\\'t completely Chinese.I doubt they shall do so again.I escaped to America|with ten million of their dollars in gold.That\\'s how you financed this operation.A good idea to use atomic power.|I\\'m glad you can handle it properly.I\\'d hate to think your decontamination|chamber wasn\\'t effective.My work has given me|a unique knowledge of radioactivity,but not without costs, as you see.Yes.Your power source had|our organisation puzzled for some time.They are still puzzled, Mr Bond.Not any longer. I sent a complete report.You\\'ve not contacted your headquarters|since you requested a Geiger counter.But there are so many files|open on you already, Dr No.Our own, the CIA\\'s...The one from the Tong society|that you robbed.When trouble comes, you\\'ll find|this is a small and naked island.An expendable island.When my mission is accomplished,|I\\'ll destroy it and move on.But the habit of enquiry is consistent.|I see you\\'re wondering why, where, when.I gratify your curiosity|because you\\'re the one mancapable of appreciating what I\\'ve doneand keeping it to himself.Just a minute. There\\'s no point|in involving the girl at this stage.Let her go free. She\\'ll promise not to talk.- No, I\\'m staying with you.|-\\xa0I don\\'t want you here.I agree. This is no place for the girl.Take her away.No!No!- I\\'m sure the guards will amuse her.|-\\xa0Let me go! No!That\\'s a Dom Prignon \\'55.|It would be a pity to break it.I prefer the \\'53 myself.Clumsy effort, Mr Bond.|You disappoint me.I\\'m not a fool,so please do not treat me as one.|And that table knife, please put it back.Well, we can\\'t all be geniuses, can we?Does the toppling of American missiles|really compensate for having no hands?Missiles are only the first step|to prove our power.\"Our\" power?

Do sit down.Thank you.I wondered what you were going to dowhen you went down from Cambridge.I never had any problems knowing whatyou were going to do, Hosein. Shukran.We don\\'t only have oil, you know.What can I offer you?Sheep\\'s eyes, dates? Vodka martini?Information. Who is putting the submarinetracking system on the market?What a pity it is you persistin being so businesslike.The gentleman you will eventuallybe dealing with is a certain Max Kalba.- Eventually?- To reach Kalba,you must first make contactwith a man called Fekkesh, Aziz Fekkesh.I\\'ll give you the address of his apartmentin Cairo, but it\\'s too late to meet today.Can I persuade youto accept a bed for the night?It\\'s kind of you, Hosein, butI really feel I...Are you quite sureI can\\'t persuade you to stay the night?When one is in Egypt, one shoulddelve deeply into its treasures.Mr Bond.Yes. I\\'m sorry. The door was open.Mr Fekkesh is expecting me.I phoned him.He asked me to give you a message.He will be a little late.May I ask where he is?Mr Fekkesh asked me to entertain youwhile you are waiting.Really?Where is Fekkesh?- You are very suspicious, Mr Bond.- I find I live much longer that way.Now, where is he?If there\\'s anything you would like...Anything at all...I had lunch, but...I seem to have missed dessert.As urgent as my appointment is,I\\'d hate him to walk in and surprise us.There is no danger of that.- He\\'s gonna be some time, then, is he?- Mm-hm.Is he meeting someone?I\\'m sorry. I cannot answer that question.I think you can.No!Where\\'s Fekkesh?- Where\\'s Fekkesh?- Pyramids.Agh!What a helpful chap.You have come tonightto the most fabulousand celebrated place in the world.Here on the plateau of Gizastands for ever the mightiestof human achievements.No traveller, emperor, merchant or poethas trodden on these sandsand not gasped in awe.The curtain of night is about to riseand disclose the stage on whichthe drama of a civilisation took place.Those involved have been presentsince the dawn of history,pitched stubbornlyagainst sand and wind.And the voice of the deserthas crossed the centuries.Excuse me, Major.I\\'ll be back in a moment.With each new dawn, I see the sun godrise on the far bank of the Nile.I am the faithful wardenat the foot of his Lord,so faithful, so vigilant,so near himthat he gave me his face for my own.I am a Pharaoh\\'s companion,and I am he, the Pharaoh.This is the tomb of Cheops,Pharaoh of the fourth dynasty4,500 years ago.Here is the great pyramid which he builtto defend himself against death.Here in the depths of this tomba servant of the king awaits the callto set out upon his journey into eternity.Death lies waiting.- Where is Fekkesh?- With the Pharaohs.- You killed him.- No, he was dead when I found him.Hope you enjoyed the show. Good night.What an unexpected pleasure.Welcome to the Mujaba Club.Buy you a drink, Major Amasova?Or may I call you Triple X?So you know who I am.You made quite an impression.I\\'m sorry about Ivan and Boris.- They exceeded their orders.- Good staff is hard to find these days.- Yes, sir?- The lady\\'ll have a Bacardi on the rocks.For the gentleman,vodka martini, shaken not stirred.Touch.Commander James Bond,recruited to the BritishSecret Service from the Royal Navy.Licensed to kill,and has done so on numerous occasions.Many lady friends, but married only once.- Wife killed...- All right, you\\'ve made your point.- You\\'re sensitive, Mr Bond.- About certain things, yes.Now, if you\\'ll excuse me,tragically, I have a previous engagement.Happily enough, so do I.- Goodbye, Mr Bond.- Let\\'s say au revoir.I have the oddest feelingwe\\'ll be meeting again sometime.- I\\'m looking for a Mr Kalba.- Mr Max Kalba is the owner of the club.Over there.Mr Kalba,my name is Bond, James Bond.What of it?You had an appointmentwith a Mr Fekkesh.Well?He won\\'t be joining you.- You have something I might like to buy.- Just a moment.I would like to bid for it, too.You forgot your drink, Mr Bond.Thank you. Na zdoroviye.It seems you have competition,Mr Bond,and from where I sit, I fancy you will findthe lady\\'s figure hard to match.Might the contestants at least bepermitted to view the article for sale?Well, now, who will start the bidding?Mr Kalba, sir.The telephone. An urgent call.Excuse me.Pardon me.This is Kalba.AII6 ? A/I6?Another?We\\'ve really got to stop meeting like this.Kalba was called to the phone.What happened?He was cutoff... Permanently.The microfilm. Where is it?Search me.He must have it, or you wouldn\\'t be here.You don\\'t know who he is.He\\'s on our records. A professional killer.Called Jaws? Make no mistake, Mr Bond.I want that microfilmand I\\'m going to get it.Unless I get it first.Watch out!Don\\'t move.The microfilm. Give it to me.Egyptian builders.Sorry.You\\'re just too late.Give me the key.The key!Give it to me.The key!Try the big one.Can you play any other tune?Let\\'s try reverse. That\\'s backwards.Would you like me to drive?- Women drivers.- Quiet! Watch this.Shaken, but not stirred.That gorilla must havehis teeth fixed by a riveter.By the way,thanks for deserting me back there.Every woman for herself, remember?Still, you... You did save my life.We all make mistakes, Mr Bond.The cylinder-head gasket.Oh.Hey! Stanna!Stanna!- Khuddnf Iii Kaa Hira- Aywa, tfadal.- What did he say?- He thinks we\\'re overdressed,- but he\\'ll take us to Cairo.- Good.It\\'s getting cold.Is thereanything I can do to warm you up?You don\\'t have to worry about me,Mr Bond.I went on a survival course in Siberia.Yes, I believe a great numberof your countrymen do.- What did they teach you?- That it\\'s very importantto have a positive mental attitude.Nothing more practical than that?Food is also very important.What else?When necessary, shared bodily warmth.That\\'s the part I like.- Is this really what they do in Siberia?- Yes, but not how they do it.You\\'re not trying to take advantage of me,are you?The thought never crossed my mind.Just when it was getting interesting.Where\\'s the girl?- Fein el bent?- El bent, enta w\\'nayem rahet.Morning, Moneypenny. Is he in?Uh-huh.My, it must have been quite a party.Boring, Moneypenny.As a matter of fact, I dropped off.- Hello, James. We\\'ve been expecting you.- Good morning, sir.There\\'s been a change of plan.You probably recognise my oppositenumber in the KGB. General Gogol.And I believe you\\'re familiarwith Major Amasova.Enough to knowwhich cigarettes she smokes.Our respective governmentshave agreed to pool their resourcesto find out what happenedto our submarines.We have entered a new eraof Anglo-Soviet cooperation.And as a sign of Russian good faith,I\\'m prepared to make available themicrofilm recovered by Agent Triple X.With considerable ease, I might add.Don\\'t bother with it. It\\'s useless.I examined it on the boat.I assure you it is quite genuine.Except that the vital technical informationhas been taken out.This was only intendedto whet our appetites.Maybe Q can make something out of it.I want that ready for Ahmed\\'s tea party.- After you, Alexis.- No, no. After you, Miles.Thank you.That could bring tears to your eyes.Everybody ready? Right.Now, we\\'re pretty certain thatthis drawing was drafted in Italy.The size correspondswith a Venetian octavo,and the typeface is an Italian one.Now, note the slight upward stresson the transversals.Q, what\\'s that mark there?Probably something the drawing wasresting on when it was photographed.Must have been done in a hurry.- Can you enlarge it?- Mm. Wait a minute.Oratory. What is that?- It\\'s another word for chapel.- Looks a bit like a bishop\\'s mitre.It is a fish. That is the symbolof the Stromberg shipping line.Karl Stromberg is one ofthe richest men in the world.One of the principal capitalistexploiters of the West, sir.It\\'s not oratory, it\\'s laboratory. Stromberghas a marine research laboratory.On Corsica, I believe.Well done, James.Actually, sir, it is in Sardegna.That\\'s brilliant. I\\'m certainthat two such perceptive talentswill enjoy working together in Sardinia,and that it will help to makeAnglo-Soviet cooperation a reality.Here we are.That was a delicious meal. Thank you.I didn\\'t realiseyou had such a healthy appetite.Neither did I. It must betravelling by train. I always enjoy it.I remember when...- What do you remember?- I was going to talk about a mission.Silly, isn\\'t it? We can\\'t talkand yet we\\'re in the same business.- But with rival companies.- We\\'re not rivals at the moment.No.Then... How about a nightcapon the company? My company.I\\'m very sorry. I have an idea tomorrow\\'sgoing to be a busy day. I must sleep.Yes. Well, then, sleep well.And you.- Good night.- Good night.What happened?He just dropped in for a quick bite.You\\'re hurt.Later.Let\\'s worry about you.What was it they taught youon that survival course?A positive mental attitude.And shared bodily warmth.Nothing about keeping out of draughts.Still enjoy travelling by train?You saved my life.Thank you, James.I\\'m sorry.Why don\\'t you lie downand let me look at it?What can we use for a bandage?How about this?Grazie.Wait a moment.- Good morning, Major Boothroyd.- Morning.Look what Q\\'s brought for us.Isn\\'t it nice?Right, pay attention, O07. I want youto take great care of this equipment.- There are one or two accessories...- Q, have I ever let you down?Frequently.- Buongiorno.- Buongiorno, signore e signora.You have a reservation for me. Sterling.Ah, yes. Mr and Mrs Sterling.Booked from Cairo.- That\\'s right.- We have suite A5 for you.A sitting room... And two bedrooms.Moneypenny being a little over-efficient.Do you have any messages for me?Thank you.Excellent.We have been granted an audience.- Mr Sterling?- Yes.I\\'m Naomi.Mr Stromberg sent me to collect you.How do you do? This is my wife,who also happens to be my assistant.- You are on holiday here?- Where there\\'s an ocean,a marine biologist is never on holiday.Can we offer you a drink before we go?No, thank you. Mr Stromberg\\'sa very busy man. His time is precious.What a handsome craft. Such lovely lines.Thank you.Very impressive.I wonder if you\\'d show my wife aroundwhile I\\'m with Mr Stromberg.- Of course. This way.- Thank you.Now, don\\'t be a bother to Naomi, darling.I\\'ll be back soon.Oh, by the way,Mr Stromberg prefers not to shake hands.- It\\'s the third button.- Thank you.Why do we seek to conquer space,when seven-tenths of our universeremains to be explored?The world beneath the sea.You seem to be well-equippedto repair that oversight, Mr Stromberg.My name is Sterling, Robert Sterling.It\\'s very kind of you to receive me.Not at all. It\\'s always a pleasure towelcome someone with a mutual interest.An extraordinary number of rare species.You recognise that variety, of course.Of course.Pterois volitans. Other fish avoid it.Those dorsal spinesare laden with venom.Handsome but deadly.I see you know your subject, Mr Sterling.One tries. You have a remarkableestablishment here, Mr Stromberg.I\\'m somewhat of a recluse.I wish to conduct my lifeon my own termsand in surroundingswith which I can identify.That is a privilege of wealth.Don\\'t you miss the outside world?For me, this is all the world.There is beauty,there is ugliness,and there is death.I think you will findthis interesting, Mr Sterling.- An underwater city.- Fascinating, isn\\'t it?- The only hope for the future of mankind.- We all have our dreams.No dream, Mr Sterling. Soon a reality.I\\'m afraid you must excuse me.I have business to attend to.Goodbye, Mr Sterling.And if we don\\'t meet again,I wish you luck with your research.Thank you. The brief glimpseyou\\'ve afforded me todaywill only encourage meto redouble my efforts.Goodbye, Mr Stromberg.- How interesting.- There you are.Darling, you should look at this model.It\\'s beautiful.This is the Liparus, the latestaddition to the Stromberg fleet,launched nine months ago.Over a million tons,it\\'s the largest tanker in the world.After the Karl Marx, of course.Really, darling? It\\'s amazingthe items of information you store away.Were they the two on the train?James Bond.And the woman is Major Amasova,a Russian agent.Let them get ashoreand then kill them.You\\'re being secretive.Where are we going?I want another lookat that Stromberg laboratory.Could he operatethe tracking system from there?It\\'s possible. All we know for sure isthat two nuclear submarines are missing.What did you think of the model?There was something strange about thedesign of her bows. M\\'s checking her out.- James, that motorcycle...- Has been following us for the last mile.All those feathers and he still can\\'t fly.- James, there\\'s...- I know. Don\\'t tell me.Mamma mia! Che successo?Oddio, tutto distrutto!Do you ever get the feelingsomebody doesn\\'t like you?Can you swim?It\\'s time we said goodbyeto an uninvited guest.Alone at last.That\\'s what we\\'ve come to look at.James!Brace yourself.Look!How did you know about that?I stole the blueprints of this cartwo years ago.Can we make it?- Hello.- Hello.- I have a message for you.- I think you just delivered it.Thank you.Sorry to interrupt you,but I asked M for a list of all the ports- the Stromberg tanker had called at.- And what is the answer?Since she was fitted out, there is norecord of her putting into port anywhere.That\\'s very oddif it\\'s true.We don\\'t make mistakes of that sort.You sound just like a Russian.I think we should take a closer lookat that tanker, don\\'t you?Yes, I do.- Shall I contact Gogol?- There\\'s no need.M has already offered to fix it.- Very nice.- It\\'s Austrian. I bought it in Berngarten.- Berngarten?- Yes, I was doing some skiing.- When was this?- About three weeks ago. Why?Do you recognise him?No. Who is he?The man I loved.He was in Berngarten three weeks ago.Did you kill him?When someone\\'s behind you on skistrying to put a bullet in your back,you don\\'t always have timeto remember a face.In our business, Anya, people get killed.We both know that. So did he.It was either him or me.The answer to the question is yes.I did kill him.Then when this mission is over,I will kill you.Come in.- Commander Carter?- That\\'s right. Welcome aboard. Major.Have a seat.- Can I get you something?- Not for me. I don\\'t know about the major.Maj...I\\'m sorry.I hadn\\'t expected you to be a woman.Aboard this vessel, Commander,I am Major Amasova of the Russian army.- Yeah, sure.- It\\'s good of you to help us out.- Got a couple of cabins at your disposal.- Thank you.Major, you\\'re welcometo use the shower in my quarters.You do not have to show meany special favours, Commander.All the same,I think it might be better if I did.From COMSUB Atlantic, sir.Right.What\\'s the matter, sailor?

You\\'ve madeyour point. How much do you want?How much?Whatever do you mean, Mr Bond?The price for not firingthose nuclear missiles.You\\'re deluded, Mr Bond.I\\'m not interested in extortion.I intend to change the face of history.- By destroying the world?- By creating a world.A new and beautiful worldbeneath the sea.Today civilisation as we know itis corrupt and decadent.Inevitably, it will destroy itself.I\\'m merely accelerating the process.That does notjustify mass murder.For that, Major,I will accept the judgment of posterity.Submarines ready for departure, sir.Open bow doors, Captain.Stromberg One,you are clear to proceed to sea.Stromberg Two,you are also clear to proceed to sea.Observe, Mr Bond.The instruments of Armageddon.Put this manwith the rest of the prisoners.No, no, no, no.

A brilliant coup.Siamese fighting fish.Fascinating creatures.Brave, but on the whole stupid.Yes, they\\'re stupid.Except for the occasional one......such as we have here.He lets the other two fight......while he waits.Waits until the survivor is so exhaustedthat he cannot defend himself.And then, like SPECTRE, he strikes.I find the parallel amusing.Our organisation did not arrangefor you to come over......from the Russians just for amusement,Number Three.Come in, Kronsteen.Sit down, Number Three, while we listento what Number Five has devised for us.I hope his efforts as director of planningcontinue to be as successful as his chess.They will be.According to your instructions,I\\'ve planned for SPECTRE......to steal from the Russianstheir new Lektor decoding machine.We need the servicesof a female member......of the Russian Cryptograph Sectionin Turkey......and... the help ofthe British Secret Service.Neither the Russiansnor the British will be aware......that they are now working for us.Number Three, is your section readyto carry out Kronsteen\\'s directives?Yes, Number One. The operation will beorganised according to Kronsteen\\'s plan.I have selected a suitable girlfrom the Russian Consulate in Istanbul.She\\'s capable, cooperative......and her loyalty to the stateis beyond question.You\\'re sure she believes you\\'re still......head of operationsfor Soviet Intelligence?It is most unlikely she would knowI\\'m now working for SPECTRE.Moscow kept my defection secret fromall but a few members of the presidium.For your sake, I hope so.Kronsteen, you\\'re sure......this plan is foolproof?Yes, it is. Because I have anticipatedevery possible variation of countermove.But what makes you think that M,the head of British Intelligence......will oblige youby falling in with your plan?Because this is so obviously a trap.My reading of the British mentality is thatthey always treat a trap as a challenge.And they couldn\\'t possiblypass up even the slightest chance......of getting their handson the Lektor decoder.They have wanted one for years.All that you say could be true.What else?As an added refinement, I thinkSPECTRE would have the chance......of a personal revengefor the killing of our operative... Dr No.Because the man the British will almostcertainly use on a mission of this sort......would be their agent James Bond.Let his death be a particularlyunpleasant and humiliating one.Good.I shall put my planinto operation straight away.And there will be no failure.Hurry!Welcome to SPECTRE Island.I hope you had a pleasant flight.My time is limited.Is the man I requested ready?- His dossier.- Good.Donald Grant, convicted murderer.Escaped Dartmoor Prison in 1960,recruited in Tangier, 1962.Excellent. Where is he now?- At the lake.- Bring him to my office, will you?Take me to the lake.Through the training area.This Grant\\'s one of the best menwe\\'ve ever had.A homicidal paranoiac. Superb material,though his methods were a little crude.His response to our trainingand indoctrination have been remarkable.I hope our work heremeets with your approval.Training is useful.But there is no substitute for experience.I agree. We use live targets as well.- Call him!- Grant!He seems fit enough. Have himreport to me in Istanbul in 24 hours.Corporal of State SecurityTatiana Romanova.Come in.You know who I am?Colonel Klebb,head of operations for... for SMERSH.I saw you once in Moscow, whenI worked for the English decoding room.Did you tell the consulateyou were coming here?- No, the message...- Yes, I know.I sent it.Your work record is excellent.- The state is proud of you.- Thank you, Comrade Colonel.Take off your jacket.Turn around.You\\'re a fine-looking girl.Sit down.I see you trained for the ballet.But I grew an inchover the regulation height and so...And then you have had three lovers.What is the purposeof such an intimate question?You\\'re not here to ask questions!You forget to whom you are speaking!- I was in love.- And if you were not in love?I suppose that would depend...on the man.Sensible answer.This man, for instance.I cannot tell.Perhaps if he was kind and kulturny.Corporal, I have selected youfor a most important assignment.Its purpose is to givefalse information to the enemy.If you complete it successfully,you will be promoted.From now on,you will do anything he says.And if I refuse?Then you will not leave this room alive.I will obey your orders.Good. Now, these are your instructions.You report to me here......but the consulate security manmust not know that I\\'m in Istanbul.- This is classified far above his level.- I will say nothing to anyone.If you do, you will be shot!Come, come, my dear.You\\'re very fortunate to have been chosenfor such a simple, delightful duty.A real labour of love......as we say.- Great sport, this!- What did you say?I said it\\'s great sport, this punting.I couldn\\'t agree with him more.I may even give up golf for it.Really?Not quite.Souvenir from another jealous woman?Yes. But I haven\\'t turnedmy back on one since.- Excuse me.- What?- Give me my shirt, will you?- What\\'s going on?- I have to make a phone call.- But we haven\\'t eaten yet.I\\'m starving.Come in, Univex. James Bond here. Over.He\\'s been asking for you all morning.Where in the world are you, James?Well, I\\'ve just been reviewing an old case.- Oh, so I\\'m an old case now, am I?- Ssh! It\\'s the office.- Tell him I\\'m on my way, will you?- He is not on his way.Sylvia, behave! We\\'ll do this againsome other time soon.Do what? Last time you said that,you went off to Jamaica.I haven\\'t seen you for six months!- I\\'ll be there in an hour.- I\\'ll tell him.Hey, your old casesounds interesting, James.Make that an hour and a half.Now, about that lunch.For my next miracle, I...It\\'ll be a miracle if he can explainwhere he\\'s been all day.But I\\'ve never even heardof a Tatiana Romanova.- Ridiculous, isn\\'t it?- It\\'s absolutely crazy.Of course, girls do fall in lovewith pictures of film stars.But not a Russian cipher clerkwith a file photo of a British agent!Unless she\\'s mental.No, it\\'s some sort of trap.Well, obviously. And the baitis a cipher machine. A brand new Lektor.A Lektor, no less.The CIA\\'s been after one for years.Yes, so have we.When she contacted Kerim Bey,head of Station T, Turkey......and told him she wanted to defect,she said she\\'d turn it over to us.On one condition.That you went out to Istanbul and broughther and the machine back to England.Here\\'s a snapshotKerim managed to get of her.Well, I don\\'t know too muchabout cryptography, sir......but, a Lektor could decodetheir top secret signals.The whole thing\\'s so fantasticit just could be... true.That had occurred to me.Besides, the Russians haven\\'tbeen up to any tricks recently.Well, really, I\\'m nottoo busy at the moment, sir.You\\'re booked on the 8:30 planein the morning.If there\\'s any chance of getting a Lektor,we must look into it.Suppose when she meets me in the fleshI don\\'t come up to expectations?Just see that you do.Miss Moneypenny, askthe equipment officer to come in, please.Q Branch has put togethera smart-looking piece of luggage.We\\'re issuing thisto all double-0 personnel.An ordinary black leather case......with 20 rounds of ammunition,here and here.If you take the top off,you\\'ll find the ammunition inside.In the side here, flat throwing knife.Press that button there,and out she comes.Inside the case,you\\'ll find an AR7 folding sniper\\'s rifle..25 calibre,with an infrared telescopic sight.If you pull out these straps,inside are 50 gold sovereigns.Now, watch very carefully.An ordinary tin of talcum powder.Inside, a tear-gas cartridge.That goes in the caseagainst the side here, like that.It\\'s magnetised, so it won\\'t fall.Shut the case.Normally, to open a case like that......you move the catches to the side.If you do, the cartridge will explode...in your face.To stop the cartridge exploding......turn the catches horizontally.Like that. Then... open normally.Now you try it.- Turn the catches... like that.- That\\'s right.And open ordinarily.- You got it?- Yes, I think so.- Is that all, sir?- Yes, thanks very much.That\\'s a nasty little Christmas present.But I shouldn\\'t thinkI\\'ll need it on this assignment.All the same, take it with you.Good luck, 007.Thank you, sir.Once more unto the breach,dear friends.And one plane ticket. Lucky man.I\\'ve never been to Istanbul.- You\\'ve never been to Istanbul?- No.Where the moonlight on the Bosphorusis irresistible?Maybe I should get youto take me there someday.I\\'ve tried everything else.Darling Moneypenny, you knowI never even look at another woman.Oh, really, James?Let me tell youthe secret of the world.Miss Moneypenny,ask 007 to leave the photograph.I\\'m sure he\\'ll recognise the ladywhen he sees her.Good luck.Hello, London.Your flight PA1 just landed Istanbul.Mr. Bond?- Kerim Bey sent a car for you, sir.- Fine.- Can I borrow a match?- I use a lighter.- It\\'s better still.- Until they go wrong.- Exactly.- I\\'ll get the car, sir.Kerim Bey suggested you see himbefore going to the hotel.- Would that be convenient?- Fine.I suppose it\\'s customaryto have people tailing you in these parts.Oh, yes, sir.Today it\\'s Citroen H 31854 on duty.They\\'re Bulgariansworking for the Russians.They follow us, we follow them.It\\'s a sort of understanding we have.That\\'s very friendly.My friend! Come in, come in!Glad to see you. Welcome to Istanbul.Well, thank you for sending the car.But it does rather tie you in with me.You\\'re in the Balkans now, Mr. Bond.The game with the Russiansis played differently here.For day-to-day routine matters, we makeit easy to keep a tab on each other.So I gathered from your chauffeur.He\\'s a rather intelligent young man.He should be. He\\'s my son.- Coffee?- Medium sweet.Two medium sweet.He also is my son.All of my key employees are my sons.Blood is the best security in this business.You must have quite an establishment.Biggest family payroll in Turkey.Not bad for a man who started lifebreaking chains and bending barsin a circus.But let\\'s talk about this business of yours.Well, M thinks I\\'m wasting my time here.And so do I.This is an old friend of mine.- And it tells me something smells.- Maybe.But if there\\'s a chanceof getting a Lektor...Now you tell me,where can I contact this girl?She said she would make her ownarrangements. You\\'ll have to wait.Thank you.My friend, if you really want my advice......you should spend a few pleasant dayswith us here in Istanbul, and then......then go home.- James Bond, I have a reservation.- Mr. Bond, your room is ready.Number 32.- 32 for Mr. Bond.- Hope you enjoy your stay.Thank you.- Will there be anything else, sir?- Only this.- Thank you.- Thank you, sir.- Mr. Bond here.- Yes?- The room won\\'t do.- I\\'m sorry.The bed\\'s too small.One moment, sir.Did you hear that?Tell him that\\'s all there is.Unless he would like the bridal suite.I\\'m sorry, sir. That\\'s all we have available.Except the bridal suite.Well, let\\'s have a look at it. I may like it.The porter will show it to you.He will be up immediately.Good.Good work. Who can the Russianssuspect but the British?The Cold War in Istanbulwill not remain cold very much longer.Ali Kerim Bey.Ali Kerim Bey.Ali Kerim Bey...You are not glad to see methis morning, chri?Overjoyed.I...I no longer please you?Be still!Back to the salt mines.Careful with those papers.Well, who won?I had visitors.Limpet mine on the wall outside.Timed to catch me at my desk.But, by good fortune, I was relaxingon the settee for a few moments.- The girl left in hysterics.- Found your technique too violent?I cannot understandthis sudden breach of the truce.It\\'s unlike the Russiansto break the peace this way.Most inconsiderate. I think my visitmight have something to do with it.Let\\'s try and find out.Close up afterwards.Quite a place you\\'ve got here.The Emperor Constantine built itas a reservoir... 1,600 years ago.Really?Here.My daily exercise.At eleven in the morningand three in the afternoon.Tie her up, will you?Mind your head now.Underneath the Russian Consulate.A present from your navy.Our friends were evicted while the PublicWorks Ministry conducted a survey.The story was thatthe traffic shook the foundations.By the time the place was declared safe,I had this installed.I can see everythingM said about you is right.Know why I stay in this mad business?It could be that you findselling rugs a bore.My friend, you should be a mind-reader.Head of the table is General Vassili.Director of Military Intelligence.On his left, Koslovski. Chief of Security.Opposite him, Benz. One of his agents.I can\\'t see the face of the other man.The one the general is shouting at.He\\'s giving him a hell of a blowing up.It\\'s too badwe can\\'t hear as well as see.Tell me, does our girl Romanovaever come to this room?Sometimes, with messages.I can see the face of the other man now.Krilencu!So he\\'s back.Another Bulgarian they use as a killer.Just the man for the limpet mine job.I\\'ve had trouble with him before.But he\\'s stayed out of Istanbulfor over a year now.Take a look. You should remember him.This man kills for pleasure.Nice face.Just a moment. A girl\\'s just come in.Probably Romanova.She\\'s the only one who\\'s allowed to.How does she look to you?Well, from this angle......things are shaping up nicely.I\\'d like to see her in the flesh.Yes.- Could you get me a plan of that place?- I wish I could.The original drawingmust be registered somewhere.I\\'ll get onto that.Now, I need a little timeto deal with this stinking Krilencu.It will be better if you didn\\'t stayat the hotel tonight. Come!I see now why you keep the Rolls.One of my sons is driving it.With two dummies in the back.In the opposite direction.They\\'ll follow it for hours.You\\'ll like my Gypsy friends.I use them likethe Russians use the Bulgars.It\\'s created a blood feud between them.Ah Kerim BeyHello, Krilencu?We\\'ve come on the wrong night.Two girls who love the same manwant to kill each other.It must be settled the Gypsy way.As I\\'m a family friend,we\\'ll be allowed to stay.We\\'re bidden to table.I hope you can eat with your fingers.Kerim Bey!Raki! Filthy stuff!Quick!Tell our hosthis hospitality overwhelms me.Thank you, thank you!No matter what happens now,say and do nothing.He\\'s asking whether they will ceasetheir blood feud and give up this fight.The tribe elders will decidewho will marry the chief\\'s son.- She\\'s saying...Thank you!- Did you get Krilencu?- No.Just a minute. Here! Thank you.You fought well.I am nothing but a clumsy old man.They\\'re making oneof the wounded Bulgars talk.Kerim Bey!It was me they were after.Why would they want me out of the way?Tomorrow we will have to findKrilencu\\'s hide-out.Meantime, I\\'ll take care of this filthy stuff.Vavra thanks you for saving his life.You are now his son.Thank you. I\\'d like to ask him a favour.Could he stop the girl fight?He says your heart is too softto be a real Gypsy.But he lets you decide the matter.As if I didn\\'t have enough problems.Vavra said for you to decide.So decide! They\\'re both yours!This might take some time.Did you pick up that package at the hotel?It\\'s on the seat.Thank you.Twice that Krilencu has tried to kill me.The third time he will succeed.Unless I get him first.- And that I\\'ll do tonight.- Not with that arm you won\\'t.You\\'d better leave it to me.I\\'m already too much in your debt.How can a friend be in debt?Here.Infrared lens.My sons.They will ring his doorbell.He has a private escape hatch.Try this for size.- Do you notice anything?- Not yet.She has a lovely mouth, that Anita.Yes. I see what you mean.Arm or no arm, I have to pull that trigger.If you think you can.You\\'ve got one shot, remember.It\\'ll have to do.Quick, he\\'s coming.Quick!That pays many debts.She should have kept her mouth shut.Hello?Breakfast for one at nine please.Green figs, yogurt, coffee, very black.Thank you.You look surprised.I thought you were expecting me.So you are Tatiana Romanova?My friends call me Tania.Mine call me James Bond.Well, now that we\\'ve beenproperly introduced...Careful! Guns upset me.I\\'m sorry. I\\'m a bit upset myself.You look just like your... your photograph.You\\'re one of the mostbeautiful girls I\\'ve seen.Thank you, but I thinkmy mouth is too big.No, it\\'s the right size.For me, that is.Yes.Is it here?What?The decoding machine, Lektor.Must we talk about it now?Or is it at the Russian Consulate?Yes.Yes... I would need a plan of the place.If you could get one, we could meetat the Saint Sophia mosque.- Like we were tourists.- Why don\\'t you ask me thatLater?Now what are you looking for?The scar.You see, I know all about you......from your file.You do? Well, I hopeyou\\'re not... disappointed.I will tell you......in the morning.We are now approaching the mostinteresting corner of Saint Sophia.Including these two great......red porphyry columns,stolen and brought from Egypt.In front of them......alabaster urnwas brought from Bergama......a famous historical city near Smyrna.Dates backfrom the Alexander the Great period.About 1648, Sultan Murad IV......brought it from Bergama.It was used as an ablution fountain.It contains a thousand litres of water.Right after the ablution fountain......we are going to a highlyinteresting column over there......known for centuriesas the Saint Sophia......wishing column.Tens of thousands......of people have wished here......putting their right hand......and middle finger in the hole...I promise you,it wasn\\'t one of my men who killed him.He didn\\'t die of old age.All I know is that it saved me the job.Once he\\'d seen the girl, she wasobviously compromised, and so...And he wasn\\'t killed because of that.Let\\'s just say that Istanbul\\'s a rough town.Let\\'s see how Tania\\'s mapcompares with your architect\\'s plans.This is the conference roomof the Russian Consulate.Yes, that checks.And this here is the communication room.That\\'s the same.She says she works there with the Lektorbetween two and three.How is she gonna get the machine to us?She\\'s leaving that to me.She\\'ll do anything I say.Anything! My dear James...You\\'re not using this.It all sounds too easy. We don\\'teven know if she\\'s telling the truth.- Well, I intend to find out.- Where? In the hotel?She won\\'t go there again.Says it\\'s too dangerous.The old game.Give a wolf a taste, then keep him hungry.My friend, she\\'s got you dangling.That doesn\\'t matter.- All I want is that Lektor.- All?Are you sure that\\'s all you want?Well...Lovely view.James, we must leave here now.If that agent reports my meeting you...- Don\\'t worry. He won\\'t.- But you don\\'t understand the danger!James, look up!Smile.Another one. Further back.About the machine...That\\'s all you are interested in. Not me.Business first.I know, once you have gotwhat you want...I haven\\'t got it yet.But if you tell me about the machine......we won\\'t always beworking on the company\\'s time.All right. What do you want to know?Talk into this.Answer my questions quietly, but clearly.How large is the machine?Like... like a typewriter.Weight?About ten kilos. Ina brown case.Brown like your eyes.Keep it technical.Self-calibrating or manual?Both, with an in-built compensator.James...- Couldn\\'t we...- Not now.Talk into the camera.- How many keys?- Symbol or code keys?Both.There are 24 symbols, 16 code keys.It is inserted in a slot and the messagecomes out in a paper roll......from another slot on the other side.The mechanism is...Oh, James, James, will you make loveto me all the time in England?Day and night.Go on about the mechanism.Oh, yes, the mechanism.Once, when it was being repaired,I saw the insides.There were many perforated discs,made, I think, of copper......with a small light...Dushka, tell me the truth.Am I as excitingas all those Western girls?Once, when I was with M in Tokyo,we had an interesting experience.Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.Later, later.Those copper discs and the light...Oh, the light, the light.James, come closer.I want to whisper something.Go on.No, not that, the mechanism!Miss Moneypenny,as you\\'re no doubt listening......perhaps you\\'d take this cable?Text reads:\"Merchandise appears genuine, stop.Go ahead with deal.

The Russian security man.Come on, never mind.Hurry!Hurry!Here\\'s one of them.And there\\'s the other one.Your passports.The pictures do not do you justice.I have rarely seen a handsomer couple.Mr. and Mrs. David Somerset.Your name\\'s Caroline.Caroline! I like that name.We\\'ve been on a business trip.On the way back to Derbyshire.- To our children?- No children.- Not even one little boy?- Nyet.I like big families.My whole life has beena crusade for larger families.So I heard.- Tania!- Yes?Lock the door.

Is that what you chapsin SMERSH call each other?SMERSH?Of course. SPECTRE.Then it wasn\\'t a Russian show at all.You\\'ve been playing us offagainst each other, haven\\'t you?Then it was SPECTRE who killedthe Russian agent in the mosque.You?Kerim and the other man?And Nash?I don\\'t mind talking.I get a kick out of watchingthe great James Bond......find out what a bloody foolhe\\'s been making of himself.We\\'re pros, Mr. Bond.We sweated your recognition codeout of one of your men in Tokyo......before he died.I\\'ve been keeping tabs on you.I\\'ve been your guardian angel.Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.Oh, yes.I\\'m much obliged.We were keeping you aliveuntil you could get us the Lektor.So you had me deliver it on a plate.That\\'s brilliant.Go on. I\\'m fascinated.Now that we\\'ve got it,you and the girl are expendable.Between here and Trieste.Girl?Isn\\'t she working for SPECTRE, too?No.She thinks she\\'s doing it allfor Mother Russia.She takes her ordersfrom Colonel Klebb.Rosa Klebb\\'s Russian.Head of operations for SMERSH.Was.Klebb works for SPECTRE now.The girl doesn\\'t know that.Well, why kill her?Orders.That\\'s only half of it, old man.Here\\'s a roll of film.She\\'ll have this in her handbag.And on you... they\\'ll find this letter.It\\'s from her,threatening to give the film to the press......unless you marry herfor helping you get the Lektor.What film?Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel.Something else the girl didn\\'t know about.Or you.You must be a pretty sick collectionof minds to dream up a plan like that.Can\\'t you see the headlines?\"British agent murders beautifulRussian spy, then commits suicide.\"Tell me, which lunatic asylumdid they get you out of?Don\\'t make it tougher on yourself!My orders are to kill youand deliver the Lektor.How I do it is my business.It\\'ll be slow and painful.How much are they paying you?What\\'s it to you?We\\'ll double it.Your word of honour?As an English gentleman?The first one won\\'t kill you.Not the second.Not even the third.Not till you crawl over hereand you kiss my foot.How about a cigarette?Not a chance.I\\'ll pay for it.What with?50 gold sovereigns- Where are they?- Up there, in my case.You show me.Here you are. What about that cigarette?Throw \\'em down there.Any more in the other case?I should imagine so. It\\'s standard kit.I\\'ll have a look.Hands back in your pockets!Keep them there.You won\\'t be needing this......old man.Tania! Wake up!Wake up, or I\\'ll leave you behind.Tania......wake up or I\\'ll leave you behind,do you hear me?Don\\'t leave me. Never leave me.Tania! This is Nash\\'s escape route.You understand?We\\'ve got to get off here. Take this.Come on.We must getto the other side of the train.Under here.Grant! Where are you?Grant!Excuse me.Now don\\'t run away.Come on!- Come on, or I\\'ll leave you here!- Stay here with me.Sleep it off in there.You\\'ll feel better in the morning.Come on, wake up.Try and straddle the truck.I\\'ll get them away from here.You hide under the truck.Quick!Oh JaI\\'d say one of their aircraft is missing.Tania!- Here, take this, and cast the rope off.- All right.Where\\'s the key?- Where\\'s the key?!- In my coat. In the pocket.All right, get out. Move.In the boat.Do you swim?Here, take the wheel. This way, please.Mind the step.Just isn\\'t your day, is it?- Where are we going?- Venice.Take a look at that locker, will you?Charts,pistol, some flares.Give me those charts.Yes, we\\'re here. Near Istria.There\\'s plenty of fuel. With a bit of luckwe\\'ll be there by morning.Three man were found dead on the trainat Trieste. One of them was Grant.What have you to say, Number Five?He was Klebb\\'s choice.Her people failed.It was your plan!They followed it implicitly!Impossible. It was perfect.Except for one thing.They were dealing with Bond.Who is Bond......compared with Kronsteen?Exactly. What have you to say to that,Number Three?Bond is still alive and the Lektoris not yet in our possession.I have already negotiatedwith the Russians to return it to them.We\\'ve agreed a price. And SPECTREalways delivers what it promises.Our whole organisation dependson our keeping those promises.I warned you.We do not tolerate failure, Number Three.You know the penalty.Yes, Number One.Our rules are very simple. lf you fail......12 seconds. One day we mustinvent a faster-working venom.Number Three!Yes!I do not wish to tell the Russiansthere will be another delay.There will be no delay, Number One.Which way are we going?The shortest route,which is between those two mountainsand straight along the coast.Ahoy, Mr. Bond!Heave to, heave to!You\\'re trapped, Mr. Bond.You cannot escape!Rifle grenade, prepare to fire.We\\'re coming through!Pull over, SPECTRE Green.Get out of the way!Give them a warning shot.Rifle grenade, fire!Forward machine gun, fire!You\\'re firing too close.SPECTRE Red, SPECTRE Green,you\\'re firing too close.You\\'re trying to stop them,not to sink them!Here, take the wheel.Slow down.Slow down. Slow down all boats.Green, go alongsidewhile we keep you covered.- Hands up, Mr. Bond!- Why give up?- Without the drums, we can go faster...- Hand me the flare pistol.Keep your hands up, Mr. Bond.We\\'re sending a boat to take you off.There\\'s a saying in England.Where there\\'s smoke, there\\'s fire.Green, change your course! Go astern!Change course!All boats, throw out your ammunition!Get rid of it! Quick!Get rid of it!Jump! Jump!Don\\'t go away.Yes?Thanks. Tell him to wait, will you?And send up a porter.Avanti!- Permesso, signore.- S, prego.And also get me the British Consul.Thank you.Yes? Mr. Maxwell, please.- James Bond.- James, we will miss the plane. We will...Hello, Paul. Bond here.I want to thank you.Tell the office we\\'re on our way.What was that?Here, leave that! I\\'ll take it.Should be routine from here on in.Not so many times...What was that you were saying?Hello, hello?Klebb.James, are you still there? Hello!Romanova,... the door!Take this.Horrible woman.Yes. She\\'s had her kicks.Here you are.In case you ever need it again.Oh, yes. All government propertyhas to be accounted for.But as I said before, we won\\'t alwayswork on the company\\'s time, will we?No.James, behave yourself.We are being filmed.Oh, not again.He was right, you know.- What is it?- I\\'ll show you.nanRead more: https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=from-russia-with-love-james-bond-007']"
