The multi-hyphenate opened about her personal life in a recent interview, stressing on the importance of nurturing yourself and relationships just as much as work 
Rihanna is in love. She wants to be a mother “more than anything in life” and marriage (to Hassan Jameel, who she has been dating for two years) is no longer a subject that’s off the cards. “Only God knows that, girl,” the popstar tells Ocean’s Eight colleague Sarah Paulson in conversation for Interview magazine. “We plan and God laughs, right?” 
Now 31, she’s worked out how to navigate the various strands of her Fenty business empire, her music career, acting pursuits and philanthropic projects while having a flourishing personal life. “I never used to be this way,” Rihanna tells Paulson. “It’s only the last couple of years that I started to realise that you need to make time for yourself, because your mental health depends on it. If you’re not happy, you’re not going to be happy even doing things that you love doing. It’d feel like a chore. I never want work to feel like a chore.” 
Her calendar is populated with bright “P”s, signifying personal days. “Just like I nurture my businesses, I need to nurture [my relationship] as well,” she shares. “I’ll shut things down for two days, three days at a time.” 
RiRi will never leave things hanging during this downtime, but works all night beforehand to ensure business decisions keep moving without her. “I don’t have a sleep pattern. I have sleep pockets. I fit it in when I can,” she notes of how she keeps up the momentum. “That’s why I take those personal days so seriously. Because it’s like, ‘You had all of me. I gave you the answers.’” 
Rihanna’s ninth album is still in the works owing to the fact she can’t commit her time solely to music. “[My career] is like having a bunch of kids and you need to take care of them all,” she explains. “I wish I knew [how long the album will take to complete]… Music has led me to these other outlets, and to things that I genuinely love.” 
With a month blocked out (aside from those designated “P” days) to finesse her new material—“I’ve gotten to the point where I’m like, ‘Even if I don’t have the time to shoot videos, I’m going to put an album out’—it could be a shorter interlude than expected.

A breakup may spell endless hours spent gorging on tubs of ice cream for most of us, but Irina Shayk reminds us that it’s important to take care of ourselves first 
Irina Shayk is doing just fine, thank you very much. After a reported split with beau Bradley Cooper last week, which had paparazzi snapping and headlines blaring, the model is taking a break from it all. Showing off her curves against a lush Icelandic backdrop, the brunette beauty proved that there’s nothing more healing than becoming one with nature. 
While some mark the end of a relationship with a dramatic and transformative chop, Shayk decided to skip the impulsive salon appointment in favour of a self-care journey. Sharing images of glaciers and videos of the country’s stunning waterfalls, it seems the supermodel is having a week of rest and relaxation in the midst of earthly wonder. The act of immersing oneself in nature, also known as “forest bathing,” is said to have mind-clearing benefits, and Shayk—barefoot and embracing the crisp mountain air with open arms—is clearly ready to take on whatever’s next.

Deepika Padukone has landed in London to start shooting for Bollywood movie 83, where she will be starring opposite husband Ranveer Singh. Check out what the couple have been up to on set 
It's been a while since news of Ranveer Singh essaying the role of ace cricketer Kapil Dev in his next Bollywood movie hit the internet. More recently, Bollywood fans also found out that Deepika Padukone will also be starring in 83, as Kapil Dev's wife, Romi Bhatia. After wrapping up her shoot schedule for upcoming movie Chhapaak, Padukone has now touched down in London to join the team of 83, and the latest pictures from the film's sets have already cropped up on Instagram. One picture you must see shows a laughing Deepika Padukone standing with Ranveer Singh and the film's director Kabir Khan. Singh captioned the cheerful snapshot, "Who better to play My Wifey than My Wifey?! 😉❤️ @deepikapadukone plays Romi Dev in @83thefilm !!! 🏏🎥🎞" 
Along with this snapshot, Singh has also shared a hilarious Boomerang of himself on set with his wife. Watch to see Padukone give him a smack with her cricket bat. Singh's reaction is one you can't miss out on. 
Deepika Padukone too has shared a mini 83 album on her official page, and also shared details about how she's preparing for her role recently in an interview with The Times of India. Given that she comes from a sports family herself (Padukone's father Prakash Padukone is a former Indian badminton player), Padukone is already familiar with Romi Bhatia. "There isn’t a lot of material available on her," Padukone said. "I have met her a few times, including our wedding reception, and I have interacted with her socially over the years. I am also referring to whatever material the director’s team has sent across to me. My parents have known their family for many years. So, I feel I know her and hope that she is proud and happy with the film. This isn’t coming from a personal equation, but from my passion and enthusiasm for the film." 
After sharing screen space with Singh in a slew of romantic dramas by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, namely Padmaavat, Goliyon ki Raasleela Ram-Leela and Bajirao Mastani, Padukone will be seen working alongside Singh in 83 for the first time since their dreamy wedding in Lake Como, which took place in December 2018. One of the cutest responses the actor has received on her Instagram post for the movie comes from Singh, who commented saying, "... and this time we don’t die in the end! Yay! 😂". 
Can't wait to see the couple together on the silver screen once again? You'll have to wait for a while. 83 releases on April 10, 2020.

In a recent interview, the Iron Man actor revealed that her and husband Brad Falchuk only live in the same house for four days a week 
Gwyneth Paltrow is not one for traditional relationship norms. See: her “conscious uncoupling” divorce announcement, or her honeymoon with Brad Falchuk, where ex Chris Martin tagged along. Now, she’s revealing one more unorthodox choice. 
Paltrow revealed toThe Sunday Times that she only lives with Falchuk four days a week. Otherwise, he sleeps at his own home nearby. 
“Oh, all my married friends say that the way we live sounds ideal and we shouldn’t change a thing,” she says. Part of her reasoning? To maintain “polarity,” or keep the relationship exciting. 
According to relationship expert Charly Lester, their arrangement “shows maturity, and an understanding of what truly works for them.” 
“If you’ve come out of a long-term relationship and understand what went wrong the first time, second or third time round, you’re prepared to do things differently,” she says. 
And they may be onto something. In addition to the aforementioned “polarity,” a two-home arrangement may be simpler for couples who, like Paltrow and Falchuk, both have their own lives and children from previous marriages. “With first marriages, the goal is often to start a family and that normally requires one roof. For second or third marriages, if you’re not thinking about having children together, or already have separate families, you might consider it simpler to stick to two roofs,” Lester says. (Of course, this set-up requires having the economic means to do so.) 
As it turns out, Paltrow and Falchuk are part of a growing trend. Lester, who also co-founded Lumen, a dating app aimed at older adults, says many of her users don’t necessarily feel the need to permanently co-habitate. “The older you get, the more established your life is, and the more content you are with it. As a result, older singles often look for more ‘part-time’ partners who they can spend occasional days and evenings with, rather than full-time live-in partners.” In fact, scientists have given this phenomenon a name: “LAT,” or “living apart together." 
And hey, if both partners are happy—which Falchuk and Paltrow sound like they are—why not?

For years, even as her dazzling talent brought her fame and adoration, Florence Welch was beset by self-loathing. Here, the Florence and the Machine vocalist opens up about how she finally called a truce in her internal war 
I wonder if my young self would be horrified at my Friday nights now: eating pasta and watching TV with someone who is nice to me. Would she think me mundane?,” Florence Welch asks herself in the July issue of British Vogue. “I have certainly had journalists bemoan to me ‘the lack of rock stars behaving like rock stars’, but hedonism never gave me the freedom I desired. And I’m no longer sure about the rock ’n’ roll behaviour often expected of artists. Too many talented people have died, and the world feels too fragile to be swigging champagne and flicking the finger at it.” 
Welch, now 32, got sober at 27, a few months after her birthday party, at which her mother made a speech to her friends asking to keep her alive and out of the notorious “27 club”. “I tend to look back on that time with a mix of nostalgia and terror,” writes Welch in the personal essay. “There’s a part of me that is in awe of that girl, her total disregard for self-preservation, how she could run at the world headfirst, eyes closed, with no care for the consequences. But I also want to hold her in my arms, say, ‘It’s OK, you’re OK, you can come down now. You’ve been screaming at the top of that tree for a bit too long.” 
Welch doesn’t know if her goal to find oblivion was born out of societal pressure, or a genetic predisposition to perfectionism and anxiety (“eating disorders and addiction are rife in my family”), but somewhere along the line she felt that she was not good enough and was angry at herself all the time. It’s a miracle now, she confides, that she hasn’t weighed herself for four years. 
“I have no idea how much I weigh right now,” says Welch. “Five years ago, I could have told you how much in the morning, at night, clothes on, clothes off. With and without jewellery. To let go of that sometimes feels like a bigger achievement than headlining Glastonbury.” 
Four studio albums down, the Florence and the Machine frontwoman says she doesn’t have it all figured out yet. “I can still come off stage with a crowd applauding and go back to sit alone in my room, scrolling through my phone until I’ve found enough things to make me really unhappy,” she explains. “Unflattering paparazzi pictures are good for that, or outfit mistakes that won’t die. Although I love social media as a way of connecting, it’s also a handy tool for digging your own personalised shame hole.”

Nick Jonas is no stranger to Bollywood music, and recently revealed two songs he loves listening to. Find out which ones they are now 
Nick Jonas never shies away from talking about his wife, Priyanka Chopra, and the influence she's had on his life. As it turns out, he's not the only one who's grown to love Bollywood since he met Chopra; sister-in-law Sophie Turner also recently said that she would love to star in a Bollywood film. 
In a recent conversation, Jonas revealed yet another interesting Bollywood-related detail that you didn't know. While promoting the Jonas Brothers' new documentary, the musician went live on Instagram with his siblings to answer fan questions. One of the most interesting came from an Indian fan, who asked Nick to name his favourite Bollywood song, and if you love dancing to Indian tracks, his answer will definitely resonate with you. 
Two of Nick's favourite tracks are 'Bom Diggy Diggy' from Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety (2018), and the iconic 'Desi Girl' from Dostana (2008). Brothers Joe Jonas and Kevin Jonas couldn't help but agree. 
After dancing to 'Desi Girl' a his Mumbai wedding reception, Jonas is a fan of the cheery track, but he's not the only one. Recently, when Chopra attended her first ever Jonas Brothers concert in Atlanta, her fans broke into an impromptu rendition of the song in her honour. Watch the video below. 
And that's not all. In one of her first post-wedding interviews, Priyanka Chopra also revealed that Nick Jonas and his family enjoy watching her films and learning the steps to her Bollywood songs. Which movies are their favourites? “Barfi! and Mary Kom,” she said. “These are two that I think they've watched, but more than that it's just been the songs, like ‘Ram Chahe Leela' and ‘Desi Girl', they know all the hook steps. It was shocking! ‘Gallan Goodiyan'... they know all the steps to everything, it's amazing!" She also recently revealed that Bollywood songs have become her husband's new "hype music".

Esha Deol just announced the birth of her second baby on Instagram, and here's everything we know so far 
Early this morning, Esha Deol posted a big announcement on her official Instagram page. The Bollywood actor and classical Indian dancer is now the mother of a second daughter, named Miraya Takhtani. The newest addition of the Takhtani family was born on June 10, 2019. 
Already a mom to toddler Radhya Takhtani, Deol shared the big news with the world saying, "Thank you very much for the love & blessings 🤗💕💕🙏🏼" and also tagged husband Bharat Takhtani in the post. The all-pink announcement post (which has already earned more than 20,000 likes) featured a sweet illustration of a baby floating down from the sky surrounded by multicoloured stars. 
The announcement received lots of love and support from the couple's friends and family, including Celina Jaitly, who responded saying "Hearty congratulations my dearest Biyara and @bharattakhtani3 on the arrival of your 2nd angel. She joins tribe number 10 with @arthurjhaag... bless you all". 
Esha Deol and Bharat Takhtani tied the knot back in June 2012 at ISKCON temple, Mumbai. After five years of marriage, the couple welcomed their first daughter Radhya Takhtani in October 2017. 
It was only in January 2019 that Deol announced her second pregnancy on social media, with an adorable picture of her firstborn that read "I'm being promoted to big sister". With the birth of Miraya, Bollywood actor Hema Malini, mother of Esha and sister Ahana Deol, has become a grandparent for the third time.

Taking a break from maternity leave, the Duchess of Sussex made her post-pregnancy debut in an outfit by her wedding dress designer 
The Duchess of Sussex is currently on maternity leave—having welcomed her first child, Archie Harrison, on May 6—but she joined the rest of the royal family this morning to celebrate the annual Trooping The Colour ceremony.

For the occasion, which marks the Queen’s official birthday (the monarch turned 93 on her actual birthday in April), the Duchess chose a navy ensemble by her wedding dress designer, Givenchy’s Clare Waight Keller, with a hat in the same colour by Noel Stewart. Meghan, who made her first appearance at the event last year, a few weeks after her wedding, travelled in a carriage with Prince Harry, the Duchess of Cambridge (who last year attended Trooping The Colour while on maternity leave with Prince Louis) and the Duchess of Cornwall. The Duchess of Cambridge wore a pale yellow ensemble comprised of an Alexander McQueen coat dress and matching fascinator by Philip Treacy. 
While Prince Harry has carried out various official duties in the past few weeks, this is the first time that Meghan has been seen in public since the couple introduced their son to the world via an official photo call at Windsor Castle on May 8, when he was two days old. Baby Archie might be too young to join in the festivities this year, but his cousins—George, Charlotte and Louis—are all expected to be in attendance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with their parents later today.

"Sometimes I feel I have a multiple personality disorder!" Sonam Kapoor Ahuja once said, and nothing sums up the vibe of a Gemini better. How similar are you to the Bollywood star? Find out now. 
“When it comes to events I try to be a character, otherwise it gets boring. Sometimes I feel I have a multiple personality disorder!” Sonam Kapoor Ahuja once said about her wardrobe in a Vogue interview, and the statement couldn't be more fitting for her Gemini personality. The sign of the twins is all about bringing two ends of the spectrum together. Geminis are social but value their alone time, love to try new things but can sometimes seem closed off and judgemental, and often, just can't make up their minds without a little help. If your birthday falls between May 21 and June 21, you happen to be the same zodiac sign as Kapoor Ahuja. Here are five personality traits you may share with the Bollywood star. 
Similar to fire sign Sagittarius, Gemini individuals have a bit of a wild streak to them, which explains their openness to new experiences. In Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's case, this rings true in the clothing department. Over the years, the actor has become a style icon to millions, and never shies away from pushing the envelope with her sartorial choices. “I’m always the first to wear a designer, whether it’s Delpozo or Yanina or Ralph & Russo. I fell in love with Ashi Studio when I saw their first collection,” she once told us in an inteview. Few may know that as a teen, Kapoor Ahuja even had a goth phase. "I wore jeans, and mostly black. I used to wear black lipstick and had my tongue and ears pierced. I had those weird chokers and straight hair." 
“I got films from my father and fashion from my mother,” Sonam Kapoor Ahuja once said. “Take these away from me, and I would probably be a librarian.” If you didn't know this already, this actor loves to read, but that's not her only hobby. Geminis often have small attention spans, but learning new, exciting skills and gleaning fresh information keeps their minds occupied. For example, Kapoor Ahuja loves arranging flowers. "I think it’s creative, beautiful and calming," she said back in 2016. And if you, like her, are a bookworm, you can even try reading two books simultaneously. “I need to read one really good book and one really trashy book at the same time. One helps me appreciate the other. I honestly thought The Hunger Games was going to be a trashy book, but it wasn’t. And when I read Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch I tweeted that it’s going to win awards and it won the Pulitzer!” 
Symbolised by the twins, Gemini individuals are known for their dual nature, which often reflects in their difficulty in making decisions. People who fall under this zodiac sign want a slice of every pie, making them come across as confused. Looking back to her earliest days in the Indian film industry, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja echoed the same in an interview with Vogue, saying that it took her some time to really settle into her career choice. "I was very confused at the point when Saawariya happened [in 2007]… I think Delhi-6, a year later, is when I knew that movies is what I wanted to do. But I was still a little confused." Once a Gemini makes a decision, however, this sign makes a full effort to commit to it. Over the years, Kapoor Ahuja's dedication to her work has earned her several accolades, one of the most recent being the special National Awards mention she received for Neerja (2016). 
Find a Gemini with low self-esteem, we dare you. This outgoing, social, happy-go-lucky zodiac sign isn't just self-empowered, it lifts others up too. Proof: “The best shoots that Vogue has done have been of me,” Sonam Kapoor Ahuja once candidly said in a Vogue interview. "I’m not rebellious. But I am who I am. I like to speak the way I speak and wear what I like to wear." Ask her husband Anand Ahuja, and he'll agree in a heartbeat. "She gives me a lot of confidence," the entrepreneur revealed in his first Vogue cover interview in 2018. "Sonam’s very black and white. She knows what’s wrong and what’s right, and is not afraid to say it." 
Though they thrive on their interactions with people, Geminis value their space and independence deeply. "I've been financially independent since I was 18 years old," a proud Kapoor Ahuja once said. "I live with my parents, but I support my team with my own earnings." Confrontational when needed, this zodiac sign may sometimes come across as passive, but isn't one you can mess with. "I've definitely grown a thicker skin since I joined the industry," Kapoor Ahuja said.“I should be able to handle my issues on my own.”

Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor Ahuja celebrated her 34th birthday on June 9, 2019 with her friends and family. Here's all the action you missed out on 
To mark her 34th birthday, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja had not one, but two birthday celebrations. To start with, the Bollywood star brought in her birthday with an intimate dinner at Le Cirque with her close friends and family, and followed it up with a brunch hosted at her parents' home in Juhu, Mumbai. Looking at the pictures, it's safe to say that this was one memorable celebration. If you missed out on the birthday album, here's a look back that takes you inside the party. 
To celebrate Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's big day, everyone from husband Anand Ahuja to cousins Janhvi Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Khushi Kapoor and Mohit Marwah dropped by the star's house for brunch. Joining them were Kapoor Ahuja's friends including Masaba Gupta, Karan Johar and Varun Dhawan. Also spotted at Anil Kapoor's home were Maheep Kapoor and Ananya Panday. One of the first pictures from inside the party to hit the internet came via Maheep Kapoor, who shared a snapshot of herself with the birthday star and other guests, surrounded by metallic pink and silver balloons. 
While most stars attended Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's birthday brunch in easy casuals, Malaika Arora joined in wearing a white Rohit Bal sari, which has also been worn previously by Deepika Padukone. The birthday girl herself aced comfort dressing in a roomy white cotton shirt by Jacquemus, which she tied in a knot and paired with a silver knife-pleat skirt by Emilia Wickstead which perfectly matched her birthday balloons. 
Over the course of the brunch, guests continued to share glimpses from the get-together, and Karisma Kapoor captioned her selfie with Kapoor Ahuja with "Special Sunday with Sonam!" Her mini album also included Rhea Kapoor, Karan Johar and Varun Dhawan. 
The night before her birthday, the Veere Di Wedding star also had a midnight  bash to bring in her big day with Anand Ahuja, parents Anil and Sunita Kapoor, Rhea Kapoor and close friends Shehla Khan, Pooja Dhingra, Samyukta Nair, Nimish Shah and many more. Don't miss the fondant Lola Bunny topping of her cake, a nod to her favourite inside joke with Ahuja. 
For her pre-birthday celebration, she opted for a black pantsuit with chandlier earrings. Kapoor Ahuja also shared snippets from her birthday dinner on her Instagram stories and wrote, "Birthday dinner with my nearest and dearest." 
Kapoor Ahuja received lots of Insta love on her birthday, and some of the most memorable posts came from her closest crew. Anand Ahuja made her day all the more special with a throwback picture from their wedding reception, which he captioned, "Happy birthday to my world," adding the hashtags #GirlfriendForever and #EverydayPhenomenal. 
Rhea Kapoor's post was one that anyone with a sister can identify with. 
Anil Kapoor also had a very special message for his daughter and wrote, "Happy Birthday, @sonamkapoor! I can't tell you how incredibly proud we are of you! You have grown into such an exemplary human being & all we can do is stare in awe & feel inspired. Just like every year, this too will be your year in new & exciting ways! Never change! Love you!"

Alia Bhatt and Anushka Sharma come together for a new initiative where fans can now buy outfits from their personal wardrobes 
As the world observed World Environment Day on June 5, Alia Bhatt continued to work on her philanthropic initiative and unveiled the third instalment of her wardrobe-sharing initiative, ‘Mi Wardrobe Su Wardrobe’ on SaltScout.com this week. Her first guest wardrobe belongs to fellow eco-warrior Anushka Sharma, who is a well-known animal-lover herself. 
Considering the positive response towards her previous two wardrobes, Bhatt decided to get fellow actor Sharma on-board and extend support to help the environment and support animal welfare. This edition will feature garments and shoes from Sharma's wardrobe, and fans can now buy outfits straight from her personal closet while contributing to Coexist, Bhatt's initiative for animal and environmental welfare. 
The concept behind 'Mi Wardrobe Su Wardrobe' is about circularity, sharing handpicked clothes from Bhatt’s, and other stars' own collections. The latest offerings will be available for sale on SaltScout.com, an online platform for charity auctions and sales. 
The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world and to counter that problem, recycling and upcycling clothing is very important. The concept of a 'shared wardrobe' is gaining more and more momentum around the world. “Production of clothes and shelf life has a skewed ratio which is a heavy burden on the environment. There is a severe lack of awareness and consciousness about the subject. I have already shared two wardrobes and am grateful for Anushka [Sharma]’s support on the initiative. I am encouraging more and more friends to create MiSu wardrobes. It gives them an opportunity to connect with fans while also helping a cause they feel strongly about. And of course, I will continue to do more wardrobes myself," said Bhatt.

Celebrations are in order in the Fenty household. Two weeks after Rihanna launched her LVMH-backed fashion brand to the acclaim from industry insiders (Edward Enninful was the first male to buy a piece from the collection), the musician-turned-mogul has tucked another achievement under her belt. According to Forbes, the “Work” singer is now the wealthiest female musician in the world. Her $600 million fortune trumps the earnings of Madonna ($570 million), Céline Dion ($450 million) and Beyoncé ($400 million). 
Most of the self-proclaimed bad gal’s fortune comes not from the royalties of her eight studio albums, but her Fenty empire. When Fenty Beauty launched in September 2017, it sold $100 million worth of products within weeks owing to the inclusive product formulations, messaging and pricing promoted by Rihanna as her own best brand ambassador. Savage X Fenty, her body-positive lingerie line, was propelled to success by the hype from her 71 million Instagram followers before the online store even opened in May 2018. By the time there were murmurs of Fenty fashion in the works, Rihanna’s world domination was well underway, and behind her were an army of “woke” women who ask more of brands. Fenty reportedly made $570 million after only 15 months. 
Let’s not forget that as well Fenty-fying our make-up bags and wardrobes, Robyn Rihanna Fenty also cracked Hollywood over the last two years. Roles in blockbusters Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets and Ocean’s 8, plus indie project Guava Island, meant that she could flex her status as a multi-hyphenate once again. And, of course, there’s the lingering promise of new music underway. 
“I feel pressure in everything, of course,” Rihanna told Vogue’s Sarah Harris at the unveiling of Fenty fashion. “I care to make it the best and present it in the best way, there is pressure every single second, I feel it… not like crumbling pressure, but fearlessness is a façade.” 
For all the myriad strands of Rihanna’s business, and those of her music industry colleagues, to celebrate, it’s difficult to ignore the fact that Jay-Z, the world’s richest male musician, has an alleged net worth of $1 billion. Thanks to the rapper’s entertainment earnings, plus art, real estate and investments, Forbes recently crowned him hip-hop’s first billionaire. Sean Combs and Dr Dre are next in line—but, if Rihanna’s business continues to accelerate at the rate it has, it’s not far-fetched to suggest that she could follow suit.

And our hearts have broken. 
Just four years after actor Bradley Cooper and former Victoria’s Secret model Irina Shayk began dating, and two years after the birth of their daughter, Lea De Seine Shayk Cooper, the pair have reportedly decided to go their separate ways. 
The news, which was broken by People on June 7, comes just three years after Shayk was first seen sporting a rather large engagement ring on her finger in 2016. As the pair are notoriously private, they are yet to confirm the rumours and their representative did not respond to the publication’s request for comment. 
Per People, an insider has said that Cooper and Shayk are currently “amicably working out how to share custody of their daughter,” born on March 21, 2017. Cooper, 44, was previously married to actress Jennifer Esposito from 2006 to 2007, and Shayk, 33, was married to professional soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo from 2010 to 2015. 
Given that just three months ago, Shayk told Glamour UK that due to the nature of her work, she “decided my personal life will be quiet,” it’s unlikely the couple will comment on the news any time soon. 
Rumours that Cooper and Shayk’s relationship was on the rocks first began to surface following the release of the actor’s hit film A Star Is Born, in 2018. However, People reports that according to a source, following the 2019 award season, Cooper took the time to focus on his family. 
“Bradley spends every day with his family,” the source said in April. “Most days, Bradley and Irina take Lea out for activities together. Sometimes they just stroll on the beach. Bradley and Irina seem great.” 
Watch this space, as we await further confirmation of Cooper and Shayk’s split.

What happens when two of Bollywood's most-talked-about couples join forces? Here's everything you need to know about Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor's possible new project together 
It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor two of the most popular couples in Bollywood right now. The second pair was in the news recently for a holiday they took together, reportedly to scout for wedding locations and apparently, Lake Como—Padukone and Singh's wedding venue—was one of their top options (a rumour Bhatt denied). 
Even if the two power couples don't end up sharing a wedding location, there's speculation that they may share a stage in the near future. According to reports, Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh are to star in a touring concert that will see them travel across the United States. New York, New Jersey, Chicago and some other cities are rumoured to be on the agenda. 
A source close to the development of the show told Filmfare: "Ranbir, Alia, Ranveer and Deepika will be doing various concerts across the United States where they will be performing on their hit numbers. It's for the first time such a thing is happening and they found it the perfect way to connect with their fans globally." 
One couldn't miss the camaraderie between the four of them at the Filmfare awards this year, where they were seen sitting together and sharing a few laughs. And it didn't end there—they were seen hanging out post the awards in a vanity van. Recently, a video of Deepika and Ranbir dancing to 'Balam Pichkari' was shared by Padukone on her Instagram stories while Ranveer can be heard cheering them on. 
There was another video of Ranveer and Ranbir shaking a leg to the song 'First Class' from Kalank, which stars Alia Bhatt, in the same van. 
If you're ready to book your tickets to watch the dream team in person, you'll have to wait a little longer. The tour, if it takes place, will only start next year once the stars are done shooting their individual projects. Deepika has already finished the schedule for her next project, Chhapaak, which will see her portraying the role of an acid attack survivor, while Ranveer just started shooting for his next film '83 where he will be seen playing the role of legendary Indian cricketer, Kapil Dev.

"People gave us a lot of shit about that and still do," Priyanka Chopra revealed to an American magazine recently 
Another month, another cover: Priyanka Chopra never fails to take over the internet with her interviews. This time around, the actor has kicked off June with a bang with by sharing her InStyle magazine cover, dressed in a shimmering nude sari. Along with the photographs, almost all of which show Chopra wearing Indian designers, the cover interview has also caught fans' attention for Chopra's quotes on life, love, fashion, and films. In case you missed it, here's a look at some of the confessions from the star. 
Born in 1982, Priyanka Chopra is 10 years older than husband Nick Jonas, a fact that people seem to keep coming back to, even six months after the couple tied the knot in Jodhpur. "People gave us a lot of shit about that and still do," Chopra said in the interview. "I find it really amazing when you flip it and the guy is older, no one cares and actually people like it." In the past, a source close the couple had also revealed that Jonas "loves dating older women, and if anything it makes Priyanka even more attractive to him." 
“I’m a very curvy woman. I like my curves. I embrace them," Chopra said in her latest interview. In the past, the actor has also taken to her official Instagram account to talk about body image, encouraging her followers all over the world to be healthy, and most importantly, to be true to themselves. "It took me the second half of my 20s to understand this, but I would love for people to understand it from me saying it as well." 
Over the years, Chopra has taken on a slew of unconventional roles with her Hollywood and Bollywood films, and continues to push boundaries in every field of her life. Why? “I like learning, and I’m not so afraid of failure that I won’t attempt something,” the actor revealed. “If you fail, which I have many times, and make risky choices, you just dust yourself off, get up, and try something else. It’s not the beginning of the end of everything.” 
Always up for a new challenge, Chopra also revealed her next big career move in the cover feature. The star, along with husband Jonas, is currently working on a reality TV show titled A Week to Sangeet, which will bring couples of different backgrounds together for a pre-wedding dance contest. "Nick came up with it because he was blown away by how the [pre-wedding] dinner brings people together," Chopra explained. "By the end everyone knows each other’s names." 
Few Indian stars have been able to cross over to Hollywood successfully, and Priyanka Chopra is one star who manages to juggle her work between India and the US seamlessly. There is, however, a method to the madness. "I knew that American pop culture was not used to seeing Indians outside the box. I was definitely not signing up for something like My Big Fat Punjabi Wedding. Or something where people would see me as a Bollywood actor with, like, 15 people coming out of a car and all of those stereotypes. I wanted to be able to shift that narrative, because that’s the India I know." 
Among the many opinion pieces Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' relationship has inspired, the most scathing took over the internet for labelling Chopra as a global scam artist. Though the star herself didn't react to the article ("Commenting on some stupidity means it eventually becomes important because I gave it importance. A lot of people don’t understand that way of thinking. It’s not a myopic thought ... it’s a long-term plan."), her family was quick to come to her defence. "Nick, Joe, Sophie, my mom, his parents, everyone was there furiously typing on their phones. They were so mad," Chopra revealed. 
"Saris are my favourite," Priyanka Chopra revealed during the interview, and if you've followed her style over the years, you may have already seen the actor sport the traditional six yard staple in every colour, fabric and style imaginable. “My problem is when it comes to Indian fashion, there are always these shiny, sequinned, over-the-top Christmas-tree outfits. Those are not the saris I wear. I grew up with my mother wearing saris to the hospital, as a doctor. She’d wear these beautiful ones made of French chiffon, with a bindi... and the nape of her neck would smell like Dior’s Poison. That, to me, was a modern woman."

Was Her Majesty throwing shade in the most royally subtle way? 
Picture this: US President Donald Trump is sitting down to a state banquet at Buckingham Palace with Britain’s ruling monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and Her Majesty points out that the plates used for the dinner are from George IV’s Grand Service. What an honour! Or, maybe not? 
Was there, in fact, a hidden message in that plate choice that very subtly threw shade at the Trump? The Queen and her loyal, long-term palace staff are, after all, masters at graceful international diplomacy; having been the ruling monarch of the United Kingdom since 1953, The Queen has decades of experience. Trump, on the other hand, has been president for just over two years. 
Of course, outwardly The Queen and any occasion she hosts are the epitome of grace, manners and decorum, she takes her duty as monarch very seriously and leads by example. However, she and her palace staff are all human with feelings and opinions of their own, which it could be speculated they may very well show by hiding telling messages in say, the choice of plates used during a dinner or drawing attention to a gift it’s highly likely the gift giver will not remember gifting. 
These tiny sleight-of-hand protests are especially important when The Queen and her staff are playing host to someone that is perhaps more of a duty rather than a delight, such as, for example, a person who allegedly hasn’t had kind words to say about a certain member of the royal family. 
The crockery used during the state banquet held for Trump overnight could be considered one example of this very subtle shade throwing. Reuters reports the dinner service was commissioned by George IV in 1806, consisting of over “4,000 pieces for dining.” It’s an impressive dinner service to say the least, but, where it gets interesting is when you think about the message behind that particular dinner service; Britain was making 4,000-piece dinner services in 1806, whereas the US had only been declared an independent country just over 30 years prior. A historical message perhaps? 
Another interesting moment of the Trump visit occurred over a pewter horse. Royal reporter Emily Andrews posted about the encounter on Twitter, noting that as The Queen, Trump and his wife, Melania, were walking together through Buckingham Palace, The Queen pointed out a pewter horse Trump had gifted The Queen during his visit to the UK in 2018, but when asked if he recognised it, he reportedly said “no”. Melania then tried to save the day by saying “I think we gave that to The Queen.” Melanie clearly got the memo about the pewter horse but it seems her husband did not. Another subtle shade throw? 
Royal protocol for interacting with The Queen is a minefield of rules and regulations that even the most dedicated of students would find challenging, however The Queen is surely more forgiving of some people and situations than others. For example, could she have acted any differently when Trump reportedly greeted her with some sort of awkward, surely protocol-defying fist bump? 
The Queen, Kate Middleton and the Duchess of Cornwall wearing white to the state banquet could also be taken as a very subtle message to their guest. Wearing white has become synonymous with female political resistance and dates back to Britain’s suffragettes in the early 20th century. Was it a nod to that movement? We don’t know but we do know that The Queen is a very masterful woman.

In a candid interview, Priyanka Chopra discussed the racism that her friend the Duchess of Sussex is subjected to, the activism that underlines their relationship, and her political ambitions 
Meghan Markle and Priyanka Chopra first bonded over a mutual desire to “change the narrative” at a women-in-television dinner a few years ago. “We just connected on how we see the world and as girls,” Chopra told The Sunday Times Style. A firm friendship was struck up while the duo was filming in Canada, and, like the other members of Meghan’s inner circle—including Serena Williams and Amal Clooney, who all attended her wedding to Prince Harry—they discussed how to use their respective platforms for the sake of activism. 
Chopra also spoke of her own wish to make a change, "I would love to run for prime minister of India... I would love Nick to run for president. I don’t like the things associated with politics… but I know that both of us really want to make a change. Never say never." 
The actor went on to say that Meghan is “progressive, modern... a self-made woman who looks like each one of us”, and that the abuse she is sometimes subjected to by the press is rooted in racism. “For sure, 100 per cent,” she said. “But the beauty of Meg is that she’s been herself through all of this. A lot of people got to know her after everything [once she became affiliated with Prince Harry], but I knew her before and she’s the same chick. Now that she’s got a real platform, she talks about the same things she always did. We spent hours speaking about the difference that influence and dialogue can make to the world before this whole thing happened, so what you see now is authentically her. She’s always been the girl wanting to move the needle.” 
Chopra believes “if there’s anyone who can handle [media attention], it’s [Meghan]”, but the actor and production company owner is making her own strides to dilute the racism she has personally experienced, particularly around her marriage to Nick Jonas. She is currently working on “a reality show with biracial couples from around the world” inspired by “the cultural cross-pollination” of her week-long nuptials, which saw the couple’s families unite for what she has previously called a “religious mash-up” of Hindu and Christian rituals and ceremonies in India. 
The newlywed also came under fire for her publicity surrounding #jopra [the couple’s combined moniker decreed by the social sphere] in December on Instagram. “Just because I’m famous, don’t I have the ability to be proud of being a newlywed without people saying that I’m using my marriage?” she questioned. “I gave up my right to privacy when I became a public person, it’s the deal you make with the devil.” 
Like her friend, who gave birth to her first son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, in May, children are also on the horizon: “It’s too far ahead to know, but both of us really want to make a change.” For now, she surmised, “my life has always been full of surprises. Whatever opportunity comes my way, I jump at it.”

After Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the next set of royal baby portraits to grace the internet come all the way from Bhutan 
In the past few months, royal watchers have been blessed with adorable new pictures of Prince Louis, Princess Charlotte, Prince George, and Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. Now, there’s a new royal name to add to that list: Prince Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck of Bhutan. 
The portrait is from royal publication Yellow Bhutan’s annual calendar, where the three-year-old posed for the month of June. “The enthusiasm with which our monthly calendars are received is always heartening,” Yellow Bhutan wrote in an Instagram caption. “We know that seeing His Royal Highness grow up so quickly brings you special happiness, so we hope our June calendar brightens up your month.” 
It shows Gyalsey Jigme Namgyel, also called the Dragon Prince, sitting upon a wall in Punakha. He wears a red checkered robe, black knee socks, and loafers. Colourful flora and the mountainous scenery of the Himalayan town can be seen in the background. 
The little prince has been a regular presence in the calendar for the past few years. In 2017, he memorably wore a stethoscope—and an ear-to-ear grin—as a tribute to the country’s doctors. “Like His Royal Highness, many children are fond of playing ‘doctor-doctor,’” Yellow Bhutan wrote. “Our health personnel are an inspiration and role models for many, for their hard work and sacrifice, and for healing and helping so many people every day.” He usually is the headliner for more than one month—so perhaps the public will get another adorable glimpse of him in the near future. 
His parents, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema, are sometimes referred to as William and Kate of the Himalayas by the Western press.

Kohli shared a few pictures from the afternoon on his Instagram page, and captioned the album, "It was an honour meeting Her Majesty the Queen and Prince Harry at the Buckingham Palace yesterday. @theroyalfamily".

Priyanka Chopra and husband Nick Jonas have been in Europe for a while and just stopped by at Frogmore Cottage to meet Meghan Markle and baby Archie in Windsor with the sweetest gift 
Since his birth, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, son of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex has been a topic of major interest all over the globe. The royal baby is seventh in line for the throne, and made his first digi appearance on May 8, when his parents came together for an official photoshoot to announce his birth. After meeting the Queen and the senior members of the royal family, Archie is now being introduced to Meghan and Harry's close friends. 
The newest personality to meet little Archie is Priyanka Chopra, who visited the new mother with her husband, Nick Jonas this past weekend in Windsor. The couple came bearing gifts for the royal baby from Tiffany & Co. Reports state that Chopra and Jonas picked out a number of gifts for the newborn, including a sterling silver bubble blower. 
"They thought baby Archie was just adorable and Meghan is loving her new life," a source revealed recently. "She looked fantastic and has taken to life as a mum swimmingly." 
Chopra and Markle have been friends for years now, and Chopra was also seen attending the royal wedding last year. Though the Sussexes weren't able to attend #Nickyanka's Jodhpur wedding, this meeting gave the two friends a chance to come together once again. "Priyanka and Meghan are still very close friends and they talk frequently," a source reported in March. "Meghan confides in Priyanka about the adjustments she has to make with being a royal." 
In case you missed it, Chopra and Jonas aren't the first friends to visit the Duke and Duchess of Sussex since they welcomed their baby. Serena Williams, her husband Alexis Ohanian, and their daughter Olympia also paid the couple a visit on their way to the French Open, as did Jessica Mulroney, who is a long time friend of Markle's.

An adaptation of Sally Rooney’s 2018 book by the same name, this one is pulling all stops to ensure that the TV series is just as good as the novel 
We’re getting a Normal People TV show*,* an adaptation of Sally Rooney’s book that you and everyone you know and the models and Taylor Swift is reading or has read. It’s already filming, and in the US, it will air on Hulu, announced today. The streaming site will air the upcoming BBC Three adaptation in twelve half-hour episodes, following protagonists Marianne and Connell as they go from high school to college while pingpong-ing back and forth like a millennial Irish Ross and Rachel. If that sounds flippant, I’m only being an ironic millennial myself—Rooney's second novel is cleverly, addictively written and I hope the show is as good as, for example, the adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s Neopolitan novels was. 
Here’s what we know: Sally Rooney is adapting the series with writers Alice Birch and Mark O’Rowe. The series stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (War of the Worlds, Cold Feet) as Marianne, and Paul Mescal as Connell. Lenny Abrahamson (of Room) and Hettie McDonald are directing the series. It premieres in 2020. 
Edgar-Jones and Mescal seem like hip, appropriately cynical yet beautiful twenty-somethings from a quick perusal of their Instagram feeds, so things bode well for the series. 
A casting call was apparently put out to real-life Trinity College students in Dublin to appear in the show, to heighten the realism (hopefully there will also be real Tesco sandwiches and bottlers of Magners). Now if the Normal People TV show can get all its Marxist theory correctly rendered, that will be a bonus.

To celebrate the wedding of her cousin Alia Chhiba, Suhana Khan joined mother Gauri Khan in Kolkata. Don't miss their festive photographs 
Gauri Khan and daughter Suhana Khan have had a busy week. Recently, the mother-daughter duo were spotted at Suhana's cousin, Alia Chhiba's wedding festivities in Kolkata, and a slew of pictures from the celebrations have already taken over the internet. One of the most exciting snapshots from the wedding, of course, shows the bride herself posing with Suhana Khan, captioned "Can't believe I'm married". While Chhiba smiles for the camera in a lime green sari, Khan sits next to her in an olive green sari-style ensemble, draped over a rust-orange ombre halter blouse. To match her clothing, Khan accessorised with statement oxidised earrings adorned with maroon stones. 
The picture, which has already been shared across Suhana Khan (and father Shah Rukh Khan)'s many fan pages, also shares a peek at the sisters' intricate mehandi designs. As for their beauty looks, Khan went with straight locks and bold highlighter while newlywed Chhiba let her jewellery stand out by pulling her hair back in a ponytail. 
Hours ago, Gauri Khan also took to her official Instagram account to share a photo from the wedding with the caption, “Shaadi hai… bride was the best dancer ❤️”. According to reports, Alia Chhiba, the bride, is the daughter of Gauri Khan's brother, Vikrant Chhiba. For this particular celebration, Khan was spotted in a scarlet embellished sari, styled with shoulder-grazing earrings and a classic low bun. 
Along with these pictures, another set of mehandi snapshots show Suhana Khan celebrating with friends and family in a shimmering mint green kurta set. For the mehandi, Khan accessorised her pretty pastel ensemble with a minimal pendant and chunky earrings. 
Just days before flying to Kolkata for Alia Chhiba's wedding, Suhana Khan brought in her birthday in London on May 22. Khan was spotted bringing in her birthday with friends at The Ivy Soho Brasserie. 
Five days later, it was time for the Khan family to celebrate again, this time for their youngest member, AbRam Khan's birthday. The six-year-old celebrated his big day on May 27 with a Marvel-themed party in Mumbai, complete with a Captain America-inspired cake, and superhero decor.

In a recent interview, Katrina Kaif spoke about her past relationship, and how she moved on from it. Here's what the actor had to say 
More often than not, Katrina Kaif has maintained her silence when it comes to her personal life, be it her family, her friends, or her romantic relationships. A recent interview with Filmfare, though, had Kaif reveal details about her personal heartbreak, and how it led to a path of self-discovery. 
In the no-holds-barred interview, the actor said “Maybe, a lot of things have changed for me personally and professionally. After my last relationship [with Ranbir Kapoor] ended, I was forced to analyse many things about myself and my life and the way I was living it. Whatever was supposed to happen, happened. Everything happens for a reason. I remember I was getting on a plane to shoot Baar Baar Dekho in Thailand. It was January. There was a repetitive thought going on in my head. When you get stuck on something, it’s deeply disturbing. It doesn’t leave you alone. It was bad. It was sad. I wondered how could something trouble you to this level? That phase made me read a lot. I wanted to understand how we human beings function. On one particular night, my attitude and approach to the world opened up again.” 
During the interview, Kaif also looked back at the emotional progress she's made since the split, saying, “Some things can still upset you. But that’s fine. I face it. I stare at the ghost in the room until it just fades away. When something triggers an emotion, I let it happen. Like one day I came across something, which I kept pushing away. But it hurt me and bothered me. While I was doing yoga, my teacher asked, “Are you okay?” I said I was fine. She said, “But you’re crying.” I had actually begun crying. It had to come out. Now, I don’t try to push things away. I stare at them. What you resist, persists.” 
Prior to the interview, Katrina Kaif also acknowledged the topic of Ranbir Kapoor's new relationship with actor Alia Bhatt on Karan Johar's talk show, Koffee With Karan. The actor revealed that the relationship wasn't difficult for her to accept, and that she has a comfortable, independent rapport with both Bhatt and Kapoor's ex-beau, Deepika Padukone. 
On the work front  Kaif will be seen playing Kumud in her upcoming movie, Bharat, an Indian period drama film directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, for which she will be seen sharing the screen with Salman Khan.

The actor has “decided to utilise this break in his schedule as an opportunity to work on some personal issues,” confirms his publicist 
Game of Thrones’ Kit Harington has checked into a wellness retreat in the US to deal with “personal issues”. The actor—best known for playing Jon Snow in the hit franchise for its eight seasons—began treatment at the facility weeks before the show’s finale aired on May 19, reports Page Six. 
The Privé-Swiss retreat—which offers support for issues such as stress, anxiety, depression and burnout—is based in Connecticut. Harington’s publicist confirmed to the Daily Mail that the actor has “decided to utilise this break in his schedule as an opportunity to spend some time at a wellness retreat to work on some personal issues”. 
Previously, Harington has spoken about how shooting the final scenes of GoT affected him. “The final day of shooting, I felt fine... I felt fine... I felt fine... Then I went to do my last shots and started hyperventilating a bit,” he told Esquire. “Then they called, ‘Wrap!’ And I just... broke down. It was this onslaught of relief and grief about not being able to do this again.” 
The actor married co-star Rose Leslie (who played Ygritte in the series) in a ceremony in Scotland last year, with many of their Game of Thrones cast members showing up to celebrate with the couple.

After organising student strikes across 118 countries, the 16-year-old Nobel Peace Prize nominee is now asking adults for support as well 
Greta Thunberg has—once again—urged adults to get behind the global preventive action against climate change. The 16-year-old activist and Nobel Peace Prize nominee from Sweden—who kick started a global youth movement in 2018 in a bid to tackle climate change—has penned an open letter (along with 46 other young activists) in the Guardian, in an attempt to rally as many as people as possible to join the planned week-long climate strike in September. 
The letter came as young adults around the world took part in an organised student strike on May 24. In a bid to raise awareness of climate change, protests are expected to reach 1594 cities and towns in 118 countries, according to Fridays For The Future (a website dedicated to the movement sparked by Thunberg). 
In September, the young activists want people to walk out of work just before a UN summit, which nations have been asked to put forward stronger methods in tackling the climate emergency. “We’re asking adults to step up alongside us… today, so many of our parents are busy discussing whether our grades are good, or a new diet or the Game of Thrones finale—whilst the planet burns,” they write. “But to change everything, we need everyone. It is time for all of us to unleash mass resistance… if we [demand change] in numbers we have a chance.” 
The students are asking world governments to provide a strategy for the planet to stay below a maximum temperature rise of 1.5 degrees. “We’re asking adults to step up alongside us,” the youth strikers write. “Step out of your comfort zone to make this a turning point in our history. This is about crossing lines—it’s about rebelling wherever one can rebel.”

To celebrate the wedding of her cousin Priya Singh, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja along with the extended family jetted off to London for an eclectic summer wedding 
Sonam Kapoor Ahuja shares a special relationship with London—the actor has often jetted off to the British capital to spend quality time with beau Anand Ahuja where she shares a home with him. Right after her glamorous showdown at this year’s edition of Cannes Film Festival, the actor made her way to her favourite city, this time along with her family, to attend her cousin sister Priya Singh’s wedding. Kapoor Ahuja took to Instagram to share updates, and the pictures give a glimpse into the unique wedding celebrations. Right from the bride’s ensemble—a printed gown worn with a biker jacker, to the wedding location (a public park in Kensington called Holland Park), there was nothing traditional about the wedding. 
Mandap what? The family celebrated the joyous occasion in light occasion wear, there was no sign of a long drawn out baraat or a ceremony that goes on for hours. Seen along with Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja are Rhea Kapoor, accompanied by boyfriend Karan Boolani, Anil Kapoor, Sunita Kapoor, her elder sister Kavita Bhambani Singh, her daughters Priya and Nandini Singh, and the groom, Ranbir Batra, among other family members. A clash of prints, elaborate headgear and statement sunglasses, were clearly the dress code for the wedding. 
Kapoor Ahuja opted for an elegant white dress by British designer Emilia Wickstead that featured a cape. The actor completed her look with accessories in black—a pair of black gloves and a fascinator by Philip Treacy, a mini bag by Dior and heels. 
The actor also shared a post congratulating the newly-wed couple, complete with lyrics by Tina Turner. Notice how the bride layered her off-shoulder printed gown with a studded leather jacket to counter the slight nip in the London air? There was of course a tiara for a touch of whimsy. 
Kapoor Ahuja was also spotted at a pre party in a printed ensemble in hues of black and gold from Sabyasachi’s latest collection. The sheer neckline added a risqué factor to the look.

The talk show host is using her platform to encourage others to speak up 
In October 2018 during an interview with Today’s Savannah Guthrie, Ellen DeGeneres opened up about the fact that she was sexually abused as a teenager. While she didn’t go into detail about the assault, she did share that she intended to use the platform she has built to empower women to speak up. And now, she’s gone one step further to ensure she is able to do just that. 
In a new interview with David Letterman, set to premiere on May 31 in the upcoming season of My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, the talk show host revealed that the sexual abuse she endured as a teenager was at the hands of her stepfather. 
“It’s a really horrible, horrible story and the only reason I’m actually going to go into detail about it is because I want other girls to not, you know, ever let someone do that,” DeGeneres told Letterman, per Vanity Fair. 
The talk show host, who previously revealed the assault occurred when she was just 15 years old, confirmed it began when her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after she got married. 
“So she had a breast removed, and they had a very, very sexual relationship, which was also very uncomfortable for me,” DeGeneres explained. “And he told me when she was out of town that he’d felt a lump in her breast and needed to feel my breasts because he didn’t want to upset her, but he needed to feel mine.” 
Confirming this occurred multiple times, DeGeneres recalls on one specific occasion, “he tried to break my door down, and I kicked the window out and ran because I knew it was gonna do—it was gonna go more to something. And I didn’t want to tell my mother, because I was protecting her and I knew that that would ruin her happiness.” 
The talk show host revealed that after a few years, she told her mother, who failed to believe her and stayed with her stepfather for the next 18 years. After a considerable amount of time, she confirmed her mother did leave her partner, as “he’d changed the story so many times.” 
“What most women do is, we just don’t feel like we have a voice,” DeGeneres told Letterman, adding that this is the reason she hasn’t talked about her assault in the past. “We just don’t feel like we’re worthy, or we’re scared to have a voice and we’re scared to say ‘no’.” 
“When I see people speaking out, especially now, it angers me when victims aren’t believed because we just don’t make stuff up,” she said. “And I like men, but there are so many men that get away with so much. It is just time for us to have a voice. It’s time for us to have power.” 
Here’s hoping DeGeneres’s story inspires others to continue to speak up.

What's it like to take a former President's daughter to prom? From the security detail to dress, here is all the information you need 
No one really wants to delve into the world post the Obama family in the White House too much but everyone’s favourite first family has been busy getting on with their lives over the last couple of years. Former US President Barack Obama’s younger daughter, Sasha Obama, is just out and about doing normal teen-related things that 17-year-olds might get up to, like attending prom. 
Obama attended her senior prom in Washington D.C. on Friday, May 24, opting for a slinky black dress with spaghetti straps and a dashing date in complementary black tux. Obama took Chris Milton as her date and it was reportedly Milton’s cousin who tweeted out the images that would go viral of the pair heading off to prom. 
Both Michelle Obama and her eldest daughter Malia were pictured enjoying the momentous occasion but no photos of Barack have surfaced just yet. Twitter flipped out over the images, with Sasha Obama’s name beginning to trend online when many were still unclear as to why. 
When her hordes of fans realised the youngest Obama was okay and just on her way to prom, there were celebrations taking place all over Twitter, with the requisite laugh out loud memes. Eagle-eyed fans also pointed out the Secret Service agent in the background of the images, watching carefully. 
“Barack and I shook the young man’s hand, snapped a few pictures, and gave our daughter a hug before sending them on their way,” Obama wrote of Malia’s prom night. “We took what was perhaps unfair comfort in the knowledge that Malia’s security detail would basically ride the boy’s bumper all the way to the restaurant where they were going for dinner before the dance and would remain on quiet duty throughout the night.” 
The former President himself has also joked about this Secret Service advantage, telling Raleigh, North Carolina’s WDCG radio station, in 2016 that his daughters are lucky enough to “have Secret Service. There’s only so much these guys can do!” 
All jokes aside, Obama noted in the same interview that he really doesn’t stress too much about his girls for two very sweet reasons: “The truth is, I’m pretty relaxed about it for two reasons: One is Michelle—she’s such a great example of how she carries herself, her self-esteem, not depending on boys to validate how you look or not letting yourself be judged by anything other than your character and intelligence. Hopefully, I’ve been a good example in terms of how I show respect to my wife.” 
The Obamas might be taking some time out of the public eye but we will always be keen to see how they’re flourishing, especially when someone goes to prom!

Dimple Kapadia will make her return to the big screen with an upcoming Hollywood movie. Here's everything you need to know about the film 
According to reports, Dimple Kapadia will soon be seen starring in a Christopher Nolan movie. From Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan to Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra, Bollywood has a slew of stars who've crossed over to work on Hollywood projects. And now, one more name from the Indian film industry will be seen in an international film, though it won't be her first time. 
Titled Tenet, this new Hollywood feature will also star Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Kenneth Branagh, Clemence Poesy and Michael Caine, and will be an action-espionage film which will be shot in seven different countries across the globe. 
Though there has been no confirmation from Kapadia herself, the actor's daughter, Twinkle Khanna, made things official when she took to her Twitter page on May 23 to publicly congratulate the industry veteran for her exciting new project. "And on a personal note - Congratulations Mother! So so proud of you!" Khanna said on her social media page. 
Fun fact: Tenet will not be Dimple Kapadia’s first appearance in an English language film. The star has in the past also been seen in the American production Leela (2002), in which she played the role of a Mumbai-based professor who gets the chance to teach as a visiting professor in California. 
Dimple Kapadia made her Bollywood debut with 1973's Bobby and is a National Award winning actor. She has proved her mettle in Indian cinema with an eclectic mix of off-beat and commercial films including Rudaali (1993), Krantiveer (1994), Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and most recently, Finding Fanny (2014). Tenet is all set for a worldwide release and will hit the big screens on July 17, 2020.

Right after Cannes 2019, Priyanka Chopra has flown to Ethiopia with UNICEF, and is using her experience to highlight female rights. Here's everything she's been up to during her trip 
Priyanka Chopra doesn't just juggle many hats, she also seems to have superhuman energy. After making her debut at Cannes 2019 last week, the Quantico star flew to Ethiopia to fulfil her commitments as UNICEF's Goodwill Ambassador. The actor took over her Instagram stories to share the reason behind her trip saying, “I am in Ethiopia for a specific reason. I want to highlight UNICEF's education programme when it comes to children and youth in the country. There is a huge barrier when it comes to access to education for children, especially because there are so many dropouts in school which begin as soon as kids start school. The primary education goes from Standard 1 to Standard 8, that is primary education. Secondary education is after that, we see dropouts of children even from first grade, so 50 per cent of kids in Ethiopia end up dropping out.” 
On Day 1, Chopra visited the Sibiste Negasi Primary School in Addis Ababa and spent time with its teachers and students. That's not all, she also met the leading members of the Gender Club, a UNICEF-supported program that empowers girls and boys and delivers relevant knowledge to help students combat harmful social practices like gender-based violence, child marriage, and sexual violence. During the trip she also paid a visit to the Bambasi Refugee Camp Primary School and met Sahle-Work Zewde, the first female president of Ethiopia. 
In the middle of discussions and interactive sessions with students, the actor, as she always does during her UNICEF travels, took out time for some fun activities and was spotted shaking a leg with the kids. Chopra even shared a video of her dance session from the school's classroom on her Instagram page, saying, “Dance is such an important part of Ethiopian culture. Wherever I have been so far…even though we don't speak each other's languages…the joy that has been shared through dance has bonded me with this amazing country forever. (Even though I'm terrible at it‍♀️) Ethiopia is extremely rich in culture and compassion.” Missed Chopra's attempt at doing the Kunama dance?

I like trying out different things," Kapoor said in an interview, also revealing that her kids can't wait to watch her in Mentalhood. "[Acting] is ingrained in you. It's something that never goes away. I was waiting for something really interesting. It was out of my choice that I didn't do any film because my kids were very young. It was out of choice that I wanted to be at home with my family and children. [Samaira and Kiaan] are excited that I'm working again. I started working at a very young age. Everyone in my family has been an actor and has contributed to this industry. I have grown up with a really strong work ethic, and I think that's hopefully gone down to my children as well." As for how her own mother, Babita Kapoor, has impacted her life, the actor said, "She has given me and sister [Kareena Kapoor Khan], strength and grounding. We have learnt a lot from her. She gave us really good values—respecting family, valuing money, working hard and be sincere and good human beings. These things go a long way. These mould you as a person." 
Can't wait to watch Karisma Kapoor back in action? You'll have to wait just a little bit longer. Mentalhood will release on ALT Balaji later this year.

As it turns out, Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas broke up for a day before their impromptu wedding at a Las Vegas chapel 
After the Billboard Music Awards, Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas got married at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. There was a serenading by Elvis. A photoshoot upon a Pink Cadillac. An Instagram livestream... by Diplo. And although that moment was wonderfully wacky, Turner is opening up about the challenges the two faced before their nuptials. 
In a new interview with The Sunday Times of London, Turner admitted that they briefly split. 
“It was the worst day of our lives,” she said. But it didn't last long: “For a second we both had cold feet, then 24 hours later we were both, like, ‘Never mind.'” 
She also revealed how Jonas helped her with her own struggles, saying he “saved her life, in a way” when she was in a “phase of being very mentally unwell.” 
“He was, like, ‘I can't be with you until you love yourself, I can't see you love me more than you love yourself.' That was something, him doing that.” 
It's just the latest example of how Sophie Turner isn't shying away from difficult topics—whether it's her relationship, or her own health—during her Game of Thrones press rounds. 
Take an appearance on Dr. Phil this past April. She talked about how, as a teenager, she started experiencing depression. The relentless spotlight, combined with social media, was a catalyst. “It was just a lot of weight comments,” she said, “or I would have spotty skin because I was a teenager, and that's normal, and I used to get a lot of comments about my skin and my weight and how I wasn't a good actress.” 
It made Turner doubt herself: “I don't think I viewed myself as worthy of anything that I was doing,” she said. But with therapy, medication, and the support of her relationship—even with its brief break-up—she found a greater sense of self-love. 
Game of Thrones came to an end this Sunday, but hopefully, Turner's candor does not.

Our watch may have ended, but the Game of Thrones memes have only begun. We round up the best from after the final episode 
The worldwide phenomenon that is Game of Thrones came to an end yesterday, and as has been the theme this season, people had a lot to say. It's been a little over 24 hours after its last episode, and true to form, the memes have arrived on our social media feeds. 
There was a lot to dig into for fans and commenters: Jon Snow made one of his boldest moves in the series and jammed a dagger into the heart of aunt/lover Daenerys Targaryen, which was followed by one of the best performances of the finale, Drogon's breakdown over his mother's death. Bran The Broken took the title of the Ruler Of The Six Kingdoms (and tried to look for an absconding Drogon with his warg GPS), Arya left to explore new lands, Sansa became a queen in her own right, and Brienne finished Jaime's story. 
With spin-offs and prequels in the pipeline, all's not over for fans of George RR Martin's hugely popular fictional universe. But as we wait, here are some of the best Game of Thrones season finale Tweets and memes doing the rounds on the internet right now.

Indian televison star Hina Khan attended her first Cannes Film Festival this year. Here's everything you never knew about her, plus sneak peeks into her Cannes experience 
Each year, the Cannes Film Festival attracts some of the world's most celebrated actors, and you're sure to spot a few Indian celebrities on its red carpets too. This time around, the annual festival was attended by the likes of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Priyanka Chopra, among others, and it also marked the Cannes debut of actor Hina Khan. In case you missed it, Khan made her appearance at Cannes 2019 between May 16 and May 20. Here's everything you may not have known about her Cannes trip. 
A household name in India, Hina Khan is a popular television actor and has worked in several Indian soap operas, her most memorable being drama series Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai. The star has been in the industry for almost a decade, and is now all set to make her debut in the Indian film industry with Lines. It's for this very film's poster launch that Khan found herself flying to the South of France this month, where she attended her very first Cannes Film Festival. 
Lines is a story of Nazia, a strong, young girl portrayed by Khan living on the country's border (LoC). The film shares her everyday struggles and problems, and will also star Farida Jalal. The poster of the film was released on May 17 at the Indian Pavillion at Cannes, and Khan made sure to share a first glimpse of it on her official Instagram page, which has been overflowing with pictures from her very first Cannes experience. Sharing the poster, the actor wrote, "Emotions don't change because of the borders in between. The life and plight of #Nazia is a simple portrayal of any girl who faces the magnitude of ordinary challenges in a not so ordinary story. Lines is my debut in films. I hope you all love it as much we loved it. This is the first look launched at Cannes Film Festival and an official poster, which depicts more than a poster can!" 
Before walking the red carpet at the 72nd edition of Cannes, the Indian television star was spotted out and about in a pink pantsuit by Sahil Kochhar. For her red carpet debut at the film festival, however, Hina Khan went all out with her ensemble, picking a grey embellished Ziad Nakad gown with dramatic sleeves. Her following Cannes looks have included an emerald green Rami Al Ali number, that geometric lavender dress by Maison Armine Ohanyan, and a coordinated sky blue shirt + trousers set by the same label. Her second walks down the Cannes red carpet was one to remember. Hina Khan's pick this time around was a sheer, metallic strapless gown by Alin Le' Kal featuring a risqué thigh-high slit a long train. 
It wasn't all just work for Hina Khan at Cannes 2019. Between promoting Lines and walking the red carpet, the actor also spent time with other guests during this year's Chopard party, for which she was invited by Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra. Hosted by Chopra and her husband, Nick Jonas, the evening was also attended by Huma Qureshi and Diana Penty. During the course of the evening, Khan also captured a mid-party selfie with Chopra, which came with a heartfelt caption. "This is the Priyanka Chopra who believes in lifting others and growing together🙏 you are a sweetheart @nickjonas #AnOutsider #FromTelevisonToCannes," Khan said on her Instagram page.

The Marvel star met comedian/writer Colin Jost on the sets of Saturday Night Live in 2006, but the couple only started dating two years ago 
It's official, Scarlett Johansson, 34, is off the market with her publicist, Marcel Pariseau, confirming the actor is engaged to her comedian boyfriend, Colin Jost, 36. 
Jost and Johansson have been an item for two years, having met on the set of Saturday Night Live back in 2006, where Jost is a writer. It was, however, over 10 years later when Johansson was back to host SNL for her fifth time in 2017 that the relationship reportedly took off. 
The couple, who made their red carpet debut at the premiere of Avengers: Infinity War, have yet to set a date but have appeared in public together several times now including the 2018 Emmy Awards and the premiere of Avengers: Endgame. 
“The first time she hosted was the first year I was a writer on the show, so we've kind of known each other since then... she's the best,” Jost told Entertainment Tonight of their initial meeting and subsequent friendship-cum-love story. 
“She's wonderful. She's working, so otherwise, she'd be here. She's pretty cool... It's hard to have a lot of complaints, she's pretty awesome” Jost told Entertainment Tonight after their romance was confirmed. 
This will be the first marriage for Jost and the third for Johansson. Johansson was previously married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008-2011 and then journalist Romain Dauriac from 2014-2017. 
Dauriac and Johansson share a child together, Rose Dorothy Dauriac, 5. 
Congratulations to the happy couple! We hope to have details on the dreamy wedding sooner rather than later.

Cannes regulars Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and daughter Aaradhya Bachchan touched down at the French Riviera this afternoon and were greeted with the most beautiful flowers 
If there's one Bollywood celebrity who shares a special bond with the Cannes Film Festival, it's Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The former Miss World first made her debut at the annual event back in 2002 when she wore the traditional six yards on the red carpet. 17 years later, the actor has become a prominent face at the celebrated film festival—as has her daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan, who has been accompanying her mother ever since she was a toddler. This year as well, we may get to see the mother and daughter duo walking down the red carpet, and we can't wait to see the couture ensembles the two will pick. 
Those stairs that you can see in most of celebrities walk down from are at Hotel Martinez, the spot that hosts the stars during their stay at Cannes. In their first picture this year at the event, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is seen stepping out of her car with Aaradhya holding a large bouquet of roses in different shades of orange and lilac. For her touch down in the French Riviera, Rai Bachchan picked an ankle-length coat by Parisian designer Barbara Bui in lime green, white and black. The statement coat was teamed with an all-black look—a V-neck top, skinny jeans and lace up boots. Junior Bachchan complemented her mother in a pastel pink top and blue jeans, teamed with metallic pink shoes. Excited to see what the mother daughter duo will wear to the 72nd edition of the Cannes Film Festival? Stay tuned for live updates.

As it turns out, Nicholas Hoult of X-Men fame is also in the running to play the iconic character in Matt Reeves’ next film. Who do you think would make a better Batman? 
Can Edward Cullen save Gotham City? When news hit last night that former Twilight star Robert Pattinson was in talks to play Bruce Wayne in director Matt Reeves's forthcoming film, The Batman, social media erupted. While some fans quickly lobbied for or against Pattinson's presence in the superhero universe, most reacted with a degree of surprise. Though the role had been vacant since Ben Affleck's departure from the DC Extended Universe back in January, Pattinson was, you might say, a left-of-field choice. 
The actor, who has spent the last decade honing his skills in indie fare with auteurs like Claire Denis and David Cronenberg, may have moved past his broody vampire beginnings, but the Internet never forgets. As the much-meme'd antihero of Stephenie Meyer's once-inescapable YA franchise, many found it hard to imagine him shaking off his character's sparkle and taking on the grittiness associated with modern incarnations of Batman. 
Like Sherlock Holmes, Jack Ryan, and James Bond, the role of Batman is always in search of its next actor. With a reboot or sequel seemingly always in development, new actors step in regularly to offer their take on the caped crusader with varying degrees of success. For every generation-defining win (Christian Bale in Christopher Nolan's critically acclaimed The Dark Knight trilogy), there is an equally prominent failure (George Clooney in 1997's franchise killer Batman & Robin). Affleck's older, gun-wielding version of the character was somewhere in the middle with many deriding “Batfleck”'s confusing dream-sequence-heavy storyline in Zack Snyder's Dawn of Justice while begrudgingly respecting his Justice League action scenes. A polarising choice from the beginning of its tenure, Affleck's superhero days were plagued with personal setbacks (a high-profile divorce and a trip to rehab among them) and conflicts behind the scenes. Originally set to act, direct, and produce The Batman, he reportedly left the project over creative differences. 
While Affleck physically fit the bill—you'll be hard-pressed to find an actor with a squarer jaw or broader shoulders—he never managed to capture the spirit of the character. Sure, Bruce Wayne can fight and has money to throw around, but the reckless-billionaire-playboy façade is only one part of the Batman myth. There's a fair amount of tortured weirdness in a grown man who chooses to dress as a giant bat and indulges in vigilantism instead of, say, spending a few hours a week in therapy. Perhaps it's fitting, then, that the actors who've managed to inhabit the role best have always been the oddballs: Michael Keaton's deadpan line delivery and offbeat looks made him ideal for Tim Burton's noir-ish '90s version, while Bale's method-actor intensity added realism to Nolan's vision; the guy who whittled himself down to 110 pounds for The Machinist probably would be crazy enough to take the law into his own hands. 
Which brings us back to Pattinson. Already adept at playing capitalist caricatures, thanks to a fantastic turn in Cronenberg's Don DeLillo adaptation Cosmopolis, he has the Bruce Wayne side of things down pat, but is untested when it comes to the action choreography and green-screen fighting side of things. Still, he's shown a willingness to get weird onscreen, whether it's delving into intergalactic infertility in High Life or chewing scenery in Lost City of Z, which bodes well for his time in Gotham. Of course, Pattinson isn't the only young British actor in the running. Moments after his name was announced, Deadline reported that The Favourite star Nicholas Hoult—whose experience as a member of the X-Men has to count for something—was also a contender. At 33 and 29, respectively, either would be the youngest to ever take on the part and hopefully bring renewed energy to a role in need of it. With Reeves rumoured to be developing an Alfred Hitchcock noir-inspired film that will emphasise the comic's connections to detective fiction, it's likely that this new Batman will be completely different than anything we've seen before. 
Departures don't always work (see: Suicide Squad), but the speculation is cause for excitement. Outside-the-box casting opens up the door for even further experimentation, something the DCEU could benefit from. DC's biggest onscreen successes—Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam!—have all benefited from unexpected casting and a playful willingness to experiment. It's time to bring that energy to Batman. Even at the franchise's lowest point, it's managed to rebound, so all risks are welcome. A millennial Batman could ditch the cave in favour of a WeWork desk or use his inheritance to invest in alternative fuel for the Batmobile. If stunt casting is your thing, Kristen Stewart could be coaxed into playing a very blasé Catwoman, or Taylor Lautner might show up in a well-timed cameo. In the most unlikely plot twist of all, Batman might even work out those crippling abandonment issues on a couch instead of on the streets of Gotham.

"I don’t mind being a mama’s boy," Ranbir Kapoor once confessed to us, and he's not the only one to have opened up about his mother in the pages of Vogue India. Here's a look back at some of Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Deepika Padukone's sweetest quotes about their moms 
When it comes to mothers, it doesn't matter if you're famous or not. Over the years, Bollywood's biggest stars, and some of India's other note-worthy names, have spoken out about their own moms and shared heartfelt quotes about the women who've always had their backs. From actors Kareena Kapoor Khan and Deepika Padukone to entrepreneur Isha Ambani, here's a look back at some of our cover stars' cutest memories with their mothers. 
"My mother is the rising sun. She is my god. Mum has always been the guiding force for both me and Karisma... I can't live without her. She is my lifeline. I make time to see her every day and everything revolves around her. When she is upset, everybody is upset. And when she is happy, everyone is happy. I worship my mother. If she disapproved of something, I would never go against her wishes."

A post shared by  Sara Ali Khan (@saraalikhan95) on Nov 7, 2018 at 10:13am PST 
"My mother is the reason I am aware of who is who in my life. She's my reality check. I was very good at studies, but I've always been a naughty child. It didn't take my mom long to realise that she would never have the privilege to call a parent and say, ‘Keep your kid away from my daughter' because her daughter was the menace." (Read the interview here.) 
"She's in her fifties and is still as diligent as ever when it comes to working out and eating right. I remember a shoot I was at in London—my mum called to say she would come stay with me, and I was really worried she'd get bored because I'd be shooting all day. But she had the best time ever. After breakfast, she'd put on her walking shoes and set out all day on foot, discovering the little things about the city you would miss otherwise. Her fitness levels are amazing, so she can do and achieve anything she puts her mind to." 
"I was very blessed that I had a mum who is financially extremely astute, and is aware of business. She taught me a lot of business as I was growing up, and taught me how to do best with my money and how to invest best. Finally, I think I must have been about 27/28 when I really started taking charge of my own finances and my own companies, and started building as an entrepreneur." (Read the interview here.)

"My parents had us after seven years of marriage—my twin Akash and I were IVF babies. When my mother finally had us she wanted to be a full-time mum initially. Later, she went back to work when we were five, but she was still a tiger mom. I remember, whenever mom and I had fights, we'd call dad to resolve the issue. My mom was way stricter. If we wanted to bunk school, dad would be like, 'It's no big deal' but mom would ensure we ate on time, studied hard and got our playtime as well. 
As much as I want to believe that women can have it all, I know that my mom gave it all up to raise us. But once we grew up, I also saw her balance work and home perfectly. Watching her play all these different roles—from full-time mom to businesswoman—I learnt how important each facet is in a woman's life and how one needs to define what “having it all” means during these different stages." (Read the interview here.) 
"I've not had the happiest childhood. But what made it easier was that my mother made me her confidant. She taught me about the important things in life, taught me to see what's real. She needs my protection, and I do like spoiling her. I don't mind being a mama's boy." 
"We know it's important to spend time together. Mum coordinates all our diaries and plans our holidays, where we just hang out watching movies and playing games. We're all super competitive, so when we play board games things become super tense!" (Read the interview here.) 
"Even now, if I don't say please or thank you, I still get yelled at by my mother. My first shot involved walking down the stairs and then doing a turn, and when I finished, all I wanted was to see my mother. She was on the phone with my sister, who was in London, and they were both crying."

After that dramatic black and white Peter Dundas gown day before yesterday, the actor stepped up her Cannes 2019 journey with an unmissable roster of new looks 
Fashion never sleeps, and neither does Deepika Padukone. After making heads turn at Cannes Film Festival 2019 in a sweeping Dundas number—with that extravagant bow that everyone's talking about—two days ago, she was up bright and early to give the sartorial wheel a fresh spin today. With husband Ranveer Singh playing virtual cheerleader in the comments section of her Instagram posts, the star paraded a slew of summer-ready looks in a matter of hours. 
The day started at 8.30am with Padukone opting for a power suit by Loewe, set in a nautical colour palette mirroring the sunny French Riviera outside. The devil lies in the detailing, and a closer look gives more proof of her sartorial savvy. The mismatched lapels of the blazer were allowed their time in the sun with a swept back hairdo, but Padukone swapped her signature sleek buns in favour of a messy tucked-in faux bob—further highlighting a pair of danglers by homegrown label, Misho. Classic black Alexandre Vauthier frames and neon orange pumps from Stuart Weitzman rounded off the boss-lady-at-leisure look. 
Padukone marched briskly back to her quarters to pull a complete 180 with her next look—an edgy black tulle dress by Off-White. The prom-ready silhouette given a contemporary update with an on-trend snakeskin bodice, and topped off with an impactful pair of black sneakers. Allowing the gentle breeze in her hotel balcony to settle her hair into playful waves, she concentrated her attention on taking a bold step into the matchy territory with coordinated acetate sunglasses in a shade of neon green that certainly did Singh proud. 
Before anyone quite had the chance to catch their breath, Padukone was out and about again in an all-white look that served as the sartorial equivalent of a palate refresher after the storm of neons. The star has never failed to deliver a winner when it comes to classics, and she celebrated her normcore aesthetic with sheer separates by Philosophy, pairing them with a tailored bralette underneath. The rolled-up cuffs of her streamlined pants made way for nude Jimmy Choos, while stacked pendants and Marc Jacobs sunnies served as the finishing touches for her portrait shots. With her hair pulled back in a messy ponytail, she opted for a dewy, sun-basked finish and defined brows to complete her look. 
Just when everyone thought they had seen the last of Padukone for the day, she stepped out once again, this time showcasing a multicoloured floral look by Erdem. The long, ruffled silhouette of her outfit was complemented with yet another black bow, this time styled draped around her neck and shoulders, while gargantuan blooms covered the rest of the ensemble. A pair of floral earrings and black pumps were all she chose as accessories, and a combination of subtle eye makeup, nude lips and a top knot made up her beauty look.

From summery jumpsuits to shimmering gowns, Priyanka Chopra's bringing her A-game to Cannes Film Festival. Here's what the actor's been up to during her trip 
Priyanka Chopra is no stranger to highly acclaimed red carpets, and her packed itinerary serves as proof. Having won over the Met Gala with her whimsical Dior look, she made her way over to the French Riviera this week for her debut appearance at Cannes Film Festival, where she will also be attending the Chopard party. Not one to do things by half measures, Chopra stepped out of the airport in Nice, France, in a polished all-white look, accessorising the head-to-toe colour with an oversized tote bag in the same hue. 
So far, the star's schedule at Cannes has been packed, but Chopra managed to find a little time to take in the beautiful sparkling blue view outside her hotel room during her trip. Scroll through her recent Instagram posts and you'll find her lensed by celebrity photographer, Nicolas Gerardin as she got ready in a white bathrobe. 
First up on the agenda was the screening of the documentary, 5B, for which Chopra thumbed through fashion archives to seek inspiration from Lady Diana. The star opted for another all-white look, this time served in the form of an accordion-pleated jumpsuit with an asymmetrical cape. A swept-back hairdo and a dash of highlighter to make those cheekbones pop, and she was ready to roll. 
For her next appearance at the premiere of Rocketman, Priyanka Chopra opted for the opposite end of the spectrum with a sweeping Roberto Cavalli number doused in a glittery palette of black and red ombre. With her hair teased in bombshell waves, she completed the look with shoulder-grazing earrings from Chopard and classic black pumps. Not one to settle for the conventional, she topped off her beauty look with a graphic winged eye and a light raspberry pink on her pout.

Releasing  on Netflix on May 31, this conversation between Shah Rukh Khan and David Letterman will give Bollywood fans a chance to get to know the star better 
Shah Rukh Khan's fame extends beyond just India. The actor has fans all over the globe, but somehow has always managed to keep his private life away from the public lens. That probably explains why his interviews always gain lots of interest, and Netflix's latest offering is one you can't miss out on if you've grown up watching his iconic Bollywood films. On May 16, world-renowned talk show host David Letterman engaged in a candid conversation with theKhan on his Netflix special, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman. The series will include special interviews with eminent personalities for up to an hour and will combine two things Letterman's talks are known for: in-depth conversations with extraordinary people, and in-the-field segments expressing his curiosity and humour. 
Shah Rukh Khan will be the first Indian celebrity to appear on Letterman's show, which has, in the past, also included Barack Obama, George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z and Jerry Seinfeld. What's more, this special interview will also mark Shah Rukh Khan's Netflix debut. After interviewing the superstar in front of a live audience, Letterman said, “The best part of this job that Netflix has been happy to provide for me is to meet people. And after each one of these sessions I think to myself, it is a very smart, very lovely person from whom I have learned things. You would maybe be at the top of that list.” Shah Rukh Khan also took to his social media to thank David Letterman for inviting him on his show and for his generosity. 
No more footprints...this is The Abominable Snowman!! Before BatMan & SpiderMan, there is Mr. LetterMan @Letterman Thx for ur generosity. Had 2 much fun being interviewed.Not becos it was about me but becos u were kind enough to make me feel I can be me. U r an inspiration sir. pic.twitter.com/8MkFpWJ0WK

After dropping hints about her trip to Cannes on her Instagram page, Deepika Padukone has touched down in France for the annual film festival 
Deepika Padukone is one busy star this month. Just days after making her third appearance at the Met Gala (this year, in a Barbie-style pink Zac Posen gown), the actor has now landed in the South of France for 2019's edition of the Cannes Film Festival. The first picture of Padukone in Cannes is finally out, and shows the actor entering her hotel while hundreds of her fans stand by taking pictures. 
For her latest flight, the star, as she often does, opted for a classic and comfortable outfit: an oversized white shirt worn with jeans and a roomy denim jacket. She did, however, add some drama to her on-flight look by way of oversized black sunglasses, a blue, black and white Celine tote bag and super glossy scarlet heels. 
  
Before being spotted in Cannes, Deepika Padukone also took to her official Instagram page to share a few sneak peeks into her travels. One post shows the actor's passport, with a boarding pass peeking out that shows her travel route, which took her from London to Nice. 
Another picture that's popped up on Padukone's page may just have been shot from within her hotel room in Cannes, and shows a beautiful bouquet of pink blooms. If you follow this Bollywood actor, you may already know that she loves loading up her Instagram page with pictures of flowers. 
Can't wait to see what Deepika Padukone will wear on the Cannes 2019 red carpet? In the past, some of the star's most exciting looks have included a vibrant green Brandon Maxwell number, and that hot pink XXL Ashi Studio gown, so it's safe to say her red carpet looks are only going to get better (and possible even bigger). 
Spoiler: the star recently posted a poll on her Instagram stories asking her fans if she should wear red on the red carpet, so you may just see her in a crimson creation this year. Along with Padukone, Cannes 2019 will also be attended by Priyanka Chopra, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kangana Ranaut, Diana Penty and Huma Qureshi.

Post the Met Gala 2019, Deepika Padukone was seen spending quality time with Rishi and Neetu Kapoor in New York. Don't miss the beautiful bracelet she received as a gift from Riddhima Kapoor Sahni 
After attending the Met Gala 2019 in that super sculpted Zac Posen gown, Deepika Padukone seems to have extended her New York trip. The actor was recently spotted spending some quality time with Ranbir Kapoor's parents, Neetu and Rishi Kapoor, who have been in the Big Apple for the past few months. In case you missed it, the Kapoors have also been visited by some of Bollywood's favourite actors during their own travels, including Priyanka Chopra, Sonali Bendre Behl, their niece Karisma Kapoor, and Ranbir Kapoor's beau, Alia Bhatt. Neetu Kapoor's latest Instagram post, however, shares a mini album of Deepika Padukone's time with her, and the pictures have already earned thousands of likes and comments. 
After the end of their two-year relationship in 2009, Padukone and Kapoor have remained friends, and have been spotted together in a handful of films (some of their most memorable movies together include Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) and Tamasha (2015)). Most recently, Padukone also shared a couch with Alia Bhatt on director Karan Johar's talk show Koffee With Karan. 
During her visit, Padukone was gifted with a delicate bracelet by Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, Ranbir Kapoor's older sister. The jewellery designer is known for her dainty creations, and also gifted Alia Bhatt a bracelet recently. Padukone took to her Instagram stories to share a peek at her new arm candy, which could very well be a belated wedding present, which she captioned "blessings and good wishes".

Kareena Kapoor Khan reveals she has a small part to play in Angrezi Medium. What made her keen to work in the movie? The actor revealed everything in a recent interview 
Kareena Kapoor Khan is a household name and has worked with some of Bollywood's most loved stars including Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Salman Khan, among others. Now, the actor is all set to work with one more Bollywood man, who we've never seen her sharing screen space with before. Reports confirm that Kapoor Khan will soon be seen alongside Irrfan Khan in Angrezi Medium, the sequel of the 2017 Bollywood film Hindi Medium. The actor announced the news recently saying she feels "privileged" to be able to work with Khan on the film. 
"It is a small part and I did not want to miss the opportunity to be working with Irrfan Khan," Kareena Kapoor Khan said. "He is the pioneer, one of the finest actors among all the Khans if I may say, and he is the biggest Khan for me. That box needed to be ticked in my career, that I had the pleasure of working with him, whether it is two scenes or three, or more. As an artist one gets to learn so much when you are part of a good film.” Adding to that, the Veere Di Wedding star said, “I grabbed the opportunity and I don't know if I will get this again. We are dramatically different actors. We don't do the same kind of movies. When this role came, Homi [Adajania] told me do it as it's a cool part, even though it is small.” 
With Agrezi Medium, Irrfan Khan will be returning to work after undergoing treatment for neuroendocrine tumour in London for the past year. Talking about her role in the movie, Kapoor Khan revealed, "It is a cop role and I am excited about it. I can't talk in any further about the role.” The film will be directed by Homi Adajania, and also stars Radhika Madan and Deepak Dobriyal, among others. Angrezi Medium is slated to release on April 25, 2020.

The organisation behind the Grammy Awards has announced Deborah Dugan as the first female CEO and president, a shocking change its 62-year-long history 
In the past the Recording Academy, the organisation behind the Grammy Awards, has come under scrutiny for its treatment of women. Now, in a welcome move, it has announced the appointment of Deborah Dugan as the first female CEO and president in its 62-year history. Dugan, who previously held the position of chief of Red, a non-profit group (founded by Bono of U2) that works to eradicate AIDS and other diseases, will assume her new role on August 1. Taking to Twitter, Dugan shared the news in a tweet: “Thrilled to share I am joining the Recording Academy as the next president/CEO. I'm honoured, humbled and ready. Excited for this new chapter.” 
Neil Portnow, the academy's leader since 2002, announced his resignation in June 2018. Dugan's predecessor came under fire for previously suggesting women needed to “step up” in order to be recognised within the music industry, in response to public disappointment regarding the lack of female winners at the 2018 awards show. It caused so much controversy that Vogue cover star Dua Lipa called out the comment during her acceptance speech at this year's awards, where she took home two Grammys. Later, the organisation appointed a group of employees to analyse the company's “various barriers and unconscious biases” in a bid to tackle diversity and sexism going forward. 
Dugan, who started her career as a Wall Street lawyer, has also previously been a record executive at EMI and is a former president of Disney Publishing Worldwide. “The goal of the Recording Academy is to support, encourage, and advocate for those within the music community,” Dugan said in a statement released by the Recording Academy. “I will listen to and champion all of those individuals, and lead this iconic organisation into the future. I'm excited to get started.”

From Janhvi Kapoor's heartfelt throwback to Deepika Padukone's hilarious video, here's a look at how your favourite Bollywood stars celebrated their mothers on Mother's Day 2019 
Mothers are the closest we'll get to superheroes in this lifetime and each year, Mother's Day gives us a chance celebrate them. The millennial way to do it, of course, is to post a sweet picture (with a caption to go with it) on Instagram. Just like the rest of the world, Bollywood went all-out on social media this Mother's Day. While Karisma Kapoor celebrated the day with her mother, Babita Kapoor and her sister Kareena Kapoor Khan along with Taimur Ali Khan, Mira Rajput Kapoor posted adorable pictures with her mother as well as with her kids Misha Kapoor and Zain Kapoor.  But that's not all, here's a look at some of Bollywood's sweetest Mother's Day 2019 posts. 
This Mother's Day, Priyanka Chopra celebrated not one, but two very special women in her life–her mother Madhu Chopra and her mother-in-law, Denise Jonas. She shared two different videos and wrote, “This year's #MothersDay is extra special because I get to celebrate the two superwomen of the #Jopra house! No number of thank yous will ever be enough to match the love I get from these two. I love you both so so much! ❤ Biiiiiiig hug!” 
Sonam Kapoor Ahuja also celebrated two mothers this year. She shared a throwback picture with Sunita Kapoor first, captioned, "Happy Mother's Day to the most loving and special person in my life. You are my strength and grace, my heart and courage. Mom, I love you so much, one day a year doesn't even begin to sum up how important you are to me and to our whole family. #MothersDayEveryday." The Veere De Wedding star then also shared a heartfelt message for her mother-in-law, Priya Ahuja and wrote,"Happy mamas day to the most elegant, kind and loving person I know... I love you mom.. thanks fo being so selfless. Anand and I are together because of your prayers and blessings.. love you lots!" 
One of this year's funniest Mother's Day posts came via Deepika Padukone, who used the occasion to share an unseen video of Ujjala Padukone mimicking a family member's dance moves. In her post, Padukone credited her acting chops to her mom, and also mentioned her mother-in-law Anju Bhavnani in her caption. 
One popular trend that was spotted this Mother's Day was throwback pictures. From Anushka Sharma and Kriti Sanon to Abhishek Bachchan, Athiya Shetty and Janhvi Kapoor, almost all of Bollywood celebrated the special day with pictures of themselves as babies with their moms. One of the most emotional posts this year came from Janhvi Kapoor. The Dhadak star dedicated her post to her late mother, Sridevi, saying, "Cherish them, listen to them, give them all the love in the world. Happy Mother's Day." Shraddha Kapoor also shared a sweet message for her mother with her throwback snapshot: "My mommy, my life, my everything. Happy Mother's Day Mommy! Your selfless love, your magic, the way that you do anything that you do, inspires me to want to be just like you #MyLife#MyEverything #TheMagicOfMothers."

A new Bollywood movie starring Vidya Balan, releasing in 2020, will feature the story of a real life Indian woman who . Ahead, we give you a preview of her life, and tell you about the other mathematicians you can meet on the big screen 
Years before she earned the moniker of ‘human computer', three-year-old Shakuntala Devi was sitting and playing cards with her father. He quickly realised that she wasn't winning every single game by fluke. Naturally, he thought she was cheating, and taking a peak at his cards when he wasn't looking. But he was wrong there too. Turns out, she was memorising the card numbers and the sequence as the game progressed, and used it to her advantage by calculating the probability. 
The prodigy in this anecdote, who passed away in August 2013, was so much more than just a mathematician. And now, Vidya Balan is set to bring her extraordinary story to the big screen. The yet-to-be-titled biography would be directed by Four More Shots Please director Anu Menon, and will reportedly release in 2020. “What truly fascinates me is that you wouldn't normally associate a fun person with math… and she completely turns that perception on its head,” Balan said in a statement. 
Shakuntala Devi's upbringing was something every young Enid Blyton fan dreamt of. Born to an orthodox Kannada family, she was raised by her father who had rebelled against his family to join a circus. It was during his days as a trapeze artist, a lion tamer, a tightrope walker and a magician, that he discovered the incredible arithmetic talents of his daughter. Thus began her journey of global recognition, starting from the University of Mysore at six years of age to Europe and New York, where she stunned the world with her ability to solve complex calculations within seconds. 
She continually proved that her calculations were foolproof, as evidenced in an interview she did with BBC on her 1950 Europe tour. Her answer to a difficult calculation posed by the interviewers was different than theirs. Turned out, their calculators had given them the wrong answer, and Shakuntala Devi was right after all. A 1976 New York Times article marvelled at her genius, exclaiming, “She could give you the cube root of 1,88,132,517—or almost any other number—in the time it took to ask the question. If you gave her any date in the last century, she would tell you what day of the week it fell on.” 
It was on June 18, 1980, that she officially cemented her place in history as the ‘Human Computer', when she earned a place in the 1982 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records. She correctly multiplied two 13-digit numbers, picked at random by the computer department at the Imperial College of London, in 28 seconds—a figure that is inclusive of the time it took Shakuntala Devi to recite the 26-digit answer to the problem. 
Arthur R Jensen, a researcher on human intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, noted in a journal published in 1990 that Shakuntala didn't display signs of being autistic, like Dustin Hoffman's character in the 1988 movie, Rain Man. Hoffman played a character who had similar mathematical abilities like Shakuntala Devi, but as Jensen noted “Devi comes across as alert, extroverted, affable, and articulate”—unlike the onscreen role. Over the years, she authored several books, including Astrology for You, Figuring: The Joy of Numbers, and The World of Homosexuals. 
Aside from beating man-made computers, Shakuntala Devi was extremely active in raising awareness for the crimes against the LGBT community in India, and calling for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in our country. In the 1970s, Shakuntala Devi divorced her husband after he came out of the closet, and decided to dedicate her life to understanding the stigmatisation of same-sex relationships in our culture, and fighting as an ally. In 1970s, she wrote The World of Homosexuals, a book that went disappointingly unnoticed at that time, but gained popularity over the years for being one of the earliest studies of our society's understanding of homosexuality. The book features a series of interviews with a gay men in India and abroad, including a same-sex couple in Canada, and delves into society's intolerance towards the community, concluding with a call to strike down medieval laws criminalising a human's basic right to love who they want. She wrote, “On this level, nothing less than full and complete acceptance will serve—not tolerance, and not sympathy.” 
Shakuntala Devi is clearly not the first mathematician whose life and work enticed filmmakers enough to showcase it on celluloid. Scroll ahead for all the other biopics you need to watch if you like movies featuring the world of math. 
The award-winning biographical drama was based on the life of black female mathematicians, including Katherine Johnson, during the early years of the Mercury Program, and NASA. It stars Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe in leading roles, and Glen Powell, Kirsten Dunst, Kevin Costner, and Mahershala Ali in supporting roles. 
The movie is based on the life of Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who overcomes his underprivileged upbringing in Madras and gains admittance to Cambridge University during the first World War. He is known as a pioneer in mathematical theories. Slumdog Millionaire actor Dev Patel stars as Ramanujan in this one, while Jeremy Irons portrays the role of his professor, G H Hardy. 
Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch stars in the biographical drama based on the life of Alan Turing, the British mathematician who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during the second World War. The film also stars Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode and Charles Dance. 
The Spanish-English language historical drama was based on the life of Ancient Greek-Egyptian mathematician, Hypatia. She is one of the world's first female mathematicians and astronomers, and her life and work is reasonably well-recorded. She also established great political influence with the Roman prefect (governor) of Alexandria, which eventually led to her violent end at the hands of a mob. The movie also sees Rachel Weisz, Oscar Isaac and Max Minghella in key roles. 
This Academy Award-winning film is loosely based on the life of mathematician John Nash (named John Forbes Nash Jr at birth), his struggles with several mental disorders and the breakthrough that wins him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Nash is known for his contributions to game theory, differential geometry, and the study of partial differential calculations. Russel Crowe played the lead role in the film, and was accompanied by Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany. 
This Russian biographical film was released as a television miniseries in 1985. It was based on the life of mathematician scientist Sofia Kovalevskaya, a pioneer for female mathematicians in the Soviet Union. Inspite of several obstacles, she managed to make a name for herself as a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

To celebrate her first Mother’s Day, the Duchess of Sussex’s first shared a significant new photo of son Archie on Instagram 
For her very first Mother's Day as a mum, Meghan Markle posted a message to Instagram paying tribute to her husband's late mother, Princess Diana, and all the other mothers in the world. 
The duchess became a mum just one week ago on Monday May 6 at 5.26am when she and husband, Prince Harry, welcomed their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, yet it seems as though she's an experienced hand at navigating the world of parenthood already. 
Markle's Instagram post struck the perfect tone as well as paying respectful, but subtle tribute to Prince Harry's beloved mum, who she will never meet, yet always manages to include in her and Prince Harry's lives. 
Taking to the couple's official Instagram account, @sussexroyal, Markle posted an adorable image of Archie's feet cradled in her hand, against a backdrop of forget-me-not flowers. The Duchess of Sussex captioned the post: “Paying tribute to all mothers today—past, present, mothers-to-be, and those lost but forever remembered. We honour and celebrate each and every one of you. Today is Mother's Day in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Kenya, Japan, and several countries across Europe.” 
The post further noted that this Mother's Day is the Duchess of Sussex's first. 
While the reference to mothers who have been “lost but forever remembered” is a very clear nod to her husband's mum, who passed away after a tragic car accident on August 31, 1997, the choice of forget-me-not blooms in the background is also a tribute to Princess Diana. The flowers were the princess's favourite, a fact Markle knows and has referenced before. 
When Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wed with great ceremony and pomp at St George's Chapel in Windsor on May 19, 2018, Markle's wedding bouquet included forget-me-not flowers. Prince Harry famously hand-picked the flowers from a private garden of Kensington Palace for Markle's bouquet, notably including Princess Diana's favourite flowers in the bouquet. 
The forget-me-nots were just one of the touching ways the couple paid tribute to Princess Diana during their wedding; among other nods, when Markle changed into her second wedding dress—a bespoke Stella McCartney gown—for the wedding reception at Frogmore House, she changed her jewellery, wearing aquamarine cocktail ring that once belonged to Princess Diana. 
With this new wonderful chapter in Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's lives, it looks as though Princess Diana will continue to be remembered and included at every important stage.

From Bollywood's Twinkle Khanna and Dimple Kapadia and Alia Bhatt and Soni Razdan, to modelling royalty Kaia Gerber and Cindy Crawford, on Mother's Day 2019, Vogue takes a look at the celebrity daughters that are a mirror image of their mothers 
They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, and that's certainly true when it comes to A-list daughters and their famous mothers. The similarities between Reese Witherspoon and eldest child Ava Phillippe have long been commented upon, and the same can be said of Lily-Rose Depp and her mother Vanessa Paradis. In Bollywood, one can definitely draw parallels between Sonakshi and Poonam Sinha, while Soha Ali Khan often looks like a splitting image of her mother and veteran actor, Sharmila Tagore. 
As well as looking alike, celebrity offspring have been known to emulate their mothers' career paths too. Take Kaia Gerber, for example, who has successfully followed supermodel mother Cindy Crawford down the catwalk, while Twinkle Khanna and Alia Bhatt have both joined their respective mothers, Dimple Kapadia and Soni Razdan, in the world of acting. 
They also frequently share similar tastes in fashion. Recently, Thandie Newton and 14-year-old daughter Nico Parker—who is making her acting debut in Disney film Dumbo—highlighted their uncanny resemblance in coordinated velvet dresses on the red carpet. Meanwhile, Gigi Hadid is often seen in 1980s-inspired ensembles, which wouldn't have looked out of place on her model mother, Yolanda. And if you're a fan, you couldn't have missed all the times Aaradhya and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have stepped out in the perfect mommy-and-me looks.

As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s firstborn, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, takes his first photocall, Vogue looks back at how royal babies, past and present, have been introduced to the world 
The safe arrival of any baby is cause for celebration, but a new royal baby elicits a form of international jubilation all of its own. Just think back to the arrivals of Prince George (2013), Princess Charlotte (2015) and Prince Louis (2018) in the UK. Or Monaco's twins, Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella, in 2014, when hundreds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the new royals, with millions more tuned in online. 
Over the years, official (and very formal) portraits—like that of Queen Victoria in 1894, holding her great grandson, the future Edward VIII, flanked by future king George V and Edward VII—have given way to more casual photocalls. The Duchess of Cambridge and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, for instance, both posed with their newborns outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital shortly after giving birth. Their respective ensembles—all three of the Duchess's Jenny Packham dresses and Princess Diana's green, polka-dot shift, in particular—also caused quite a frenzy. Similarly, Japan's Princess Kiko and Prince Akishino posed with newborn Prince Hisahito upon departing the hospital in 2006; while Monaco's Princess Stéphanie (in 1992) and Princess Caroline (in 1987)—both in elegant silk dressing gowns—released images of them holding their newborn sons from inside the hospital. 
Christenings are another opportunity to capture an official family portrait: see baby Prince Willem-Alexander's christening in 1967 and Crown Princess Alexia Area's in 1965. More recently, royals have taken to releasing official portraits without state occasion as a way of celebrating a new addition to their family. These images are characterised by a more relaxed approach: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are fans of this set-up, as are Sweden's Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia. 
As the world welcomes the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's firstborn, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, Vogue takes a look back through the annals of royal baby photography.

Will the dragons come back too? Is Jon going to die? Vogue compiles all the fan theories that are doing the rounds on the internet before Game of Thrones season 8 reaches its end 
The Night King is dead, and so is Missandei. Now that the final battle between Daenerys and Cersei is fast approaching, it's time to take a step back and examine all the theories and predictions for what will happen at the end of Game of Thrones. Why? Because sitting alone and obsessing over who will take the Iron Throne is not as fun as discussing it with strangers online. Ahead, we've compiled everything the internet is prophesying based on past seasons and the Song of Ice and Fire series of novels by George R R Martin, to give you enough fodder for speculation until we finally find out if our favourite characters survive the end or not. 
Cersei's motivation throughout the series has singularly been the protection of her children. Despite losing all three of them, she is possibly pregnant again and will do everything she can to make sure that this baby remains safe. Even if it means destroying all of King's Landing, à la the Sept of Baelor. But if you recall, in season five, Cersei has a flashback to the time when she and a friend visited a fortune teller named Maggy the Frog, a mystical woman from Essos. Cersei has asked her three questions, including whether she will have any children. Maggy tells her that she will have three, “Gold will be their crowns, gold their shrouds,” she foretold. This means that her fourth child may not survive the war, which might be the reason for Cersei's descent into full Mad Queen mode. 
Speaking of Maggy the Frog, the TV show left out an important part of the prophecy. After answering Cersei's questions, she says, “When your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.” Valonqar is High Valyrian for ‘little brother'. Throughout the series, Cersei has believed that the prophesied valonqar is actually Tyrion Lannister, but a popular fan theory suggests that it can actually be her twin brother Jaime. Jaime is the younger twin amongst the two, and is perfectly poised to be the one who takes Cersei's life. In the past, Jaime has killed the Mad King to protect the city from being destroyed by wild fire. He is already aware that Cersei has gone far from being rational since the death of her children, and can possibly follow in the Mad King's footsteps. In the last episode, he leaves Brienne's side to be with Cersei, and the episode five promo suggests that he has finally reached King's Landing. Will he be the one to kill Cersei? Or will he choose to die alongside her? We'll just have to wait and see. 
Remember the handsome sellsword who was tasked by Daenerys to stay back in Meereen and rule in her place? Turns out, he might be an essential key to winning the final battle against Cersei. 
Daenerys knows that Cersei has enlisted the help of the Golden Company to fight the battle for her. This places Dany at a disadvantage, as her army of the Unsullied, Dothraki, and the remaining Northerners, is tired and depleted in numbers. A popular fan theory that claimed that Daario would turn out to be the chief of the Golden Company was debunked when the season premiere showed Harry Strickland as the captain of Cersei's sellswords. But fact is that Daario still commands a rival sellsword company called the Second Sons. It's possible that Daario is aware that the Golden Company has been recruited by Cersei, and this could have alerted him to rush to Daenerys' side with his army. If the Second Sons join Daenerys, she might have a fighting chance against Cersei's army. 
The Golden Company is a 20,000-strong group of mercenary sellswords based in Essos. The group was founded by a Targaryen bastard and is notorious for its loyalty. Their motto even says that their word is as good as gold. In season seven, we learned that Cersei had sent Euron Greyjoy to enlist the Golden Company to fight for her. Now that they're at King's Landing to do Cersei's bidding, is it possible that they'll switch teams and break their contracts? It is. Stay with us, we'll explain how it's possible. In the books, the Golden Company has always been loyal to the Targaryen cause. A major plot point removed from the show, but essential in the book, is about a boy named Griff, who claims to be the son of Rhaegar Targareyn and Elia Martell (essentially Jon Snow's step brother). He is being helped by Varys and Illyrio Mopatis, the Pentoshi magister who hosted Daenerys and Varys until she was wedded off to Khal Drogo. But in the show, they haven't mentioned Griff at all, and with only two episodes left, it seems highly unlikely that they will. Griff's storyline has possibly been merged with Jon Snow's and the events of episode four might be foreshadowing all of this. Varys is ready to betray Daenerys in favour of Jon Snow taking the Iron Thorne. He could be conspiring with Illyrio to turn the Golden Company to their side by mentioning a possibility of a Westeros-born Targaryen here, Jon or Aegon Targaryen. 
Despite being the MVP of Winterfell's battle against the Army of the Dead, Arya hasn't put her skills as one of the assassins serving the God of Death to use till now. Is Arya one of the Faceless Men? She does employ her face swapping skills to dispose of Walder Frey and his family. But she also denounces her title of ‘no one' and proclaims that she is, in fact, Arya Stark of Winterfell, Let's take a moment here to examine Mellisandre's prophecy about her, the one that she repeats in episode three, about Arya shutting blue, brown, and green eyes forever. The only potential green eyes left in Westeros at the moment belong to Cersei, someone who is already on Arya's list. It's possible that Arya will fulfil Cersei's valonqar prophecy by taking Jaime's face and killing her in his form. This might appear far-fetched at the moment, but will anything really surprise you now? 
Daenerys' arc on the show has been under fire for portraying her as going mad with ambition. Her reaction to Jon's revelation was actually pretty reasonable, considering she has worked all her life to reach where she is now, but Jon could swoop in and take away her place without half the struggle she went through. Varys and Tyrion have both noticed this, and are worried now that she would follow the footsteps of her father and destroy innocent lives in the process of gaining power. Another person who is relying on this is Cersei, who might be seeking to destroy Daenerys' reputation as the ‘Breaker of Chains' and render her in the same light as other tyrants, including the Mad King, in front of the people of Westeros. But Daenerys might be smarter than that. In the last episode, Missendei's last words to her suggest that Dany is ready to rain hellfire on Cersei and burn King's Landing to the ground. But it's possible that Daenerys has taken Tyrion and Varys' warnings of not turning into what she despised to heed, and devised a plan that would destroy Cersei without harming the innocent people in King's Landing. Everything in the show up till now suggests that Dany is on the verge of losing it entirely, but as is the way of the show, there might be a twist that would change everything we believed in until now. 
Daenerys started off with three dragons, but thanks to the Night King and Euron Greyjoy (and Qyburn's Scorpion), she is now left with one single dragon, Drogon. It's a strong possibility that Drogon might fall in the last battle since King's Landing has been lined with even more dragon-killing contraptions, but it might not mean the end of dragons for Westeros. It's a major possibility that Drogon might lay eggs, spawning the possibility of more dragons in the future, especially if they win the battle against Cersei and Dany or Jon ascends to the Iron Throne. It's one of the more cheerful theories and is a small source of optimism in the face of utter annihilation of both the dragon and the Dragon Queen. 
This theory has been foreshadowed by Podrick's haunting song from the second episode, where he sits amongst Tyrion, Jaime, Tormund, Ser Davos and Brienne, and sings about Jenny of Oldstones. Fans have noticed that there are several parallels between Jenny and her lover Duncan's story (Daenerys' uncle and Jon's great uncle) to Daenerys and Jon's. Duncan Targaryen gave up the chance to rule Westeros so that he could marry Jenny. Will Jon do the same for Daenerys? Does this imply that Jon has to die in order for Dany to win the Iron Throne? Only the old Gods and the show writers know.

On May 1, Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner (now Jonas) tied the knot with singer Joe Jonas in a spontaneous wedding ceremony in Las Vegas. Now, the newlywed’s sister-in-law, Priyanka Chopra spills the beans on their celebration and the couple's new nickname 
In a recent interview with Access, Priyanka Chopra spilled some details about Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner's wedding with Joe Jonas. While the nuptials, which took place in Las Vegas, came as a surprise to fans the world over, Chopra revealed it was “on brand” for the care-free newlywed couple. After attending the annual Billboard Music Awards on May 1, Turner and Jonas exchanged vows in front of an intimate gathering of friends and family members at the Little White Chapel in Vegas. “It was really funny. We were at the Billboards. Joe, I think had this idea that he wanted to do this. But we were at the Billboards and he had these little black cards that we all got,” she continued. 
“We were randomly inviting our friends, like people that we met. We were like, 'alright, we're going to set up this wedding now, we're going to the chapel right from here, and please arrive, please arrive,” she added. Glimpses of the wedding were seen on Diplo's Instagram stories. “We had Diplo, Khalid, they were really sweet, they arrived. Diplo Instagram Live-d the whole thing, it was awesome.” He filmed Turner walking down the aisle in a silk top and pants to an acoustic version of 'Speechless'. Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas stood by as groomsmen. 
“That was so fun. It was so fun!” The 37-year-old actor also mentioned the cute nickname she has for the couple saying, “I call them Jophie. It's like, trust them to do that. That is Jophie!” This wedding will be the first of two celebrations. “They are going to have this amazing, beautiful wedding obviously,” she revealed. Previous reports suggested the couple will wed officially this June in France. 
Until then, fans can hope to continue seeing them out and about together. Most recently, Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas made their first public appearance as husband and wife at the Met Gala recently. The duo twinned in colourful sequinned ensembles by Louis Vuitton. Fun fact: Turner's colourful catsuit was constructed using over three million sequins!

As Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor is presented to the world, royal correspondent Victoria Murphy looks at what the future holds for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their new arrival 
Proud new parents the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were beaming as they posed for the first official photographs with their newborn son, Archie, earlier today. Standing in Windsor Castle's St George's Hall, where their wedding reception was held almost a year ago, the couple rejected a large-scale media moment in favour of a more intimate photocall. This decision was in-keeping with their request for privacy surrounding the birth, setting the tone for them being in control when it comes to what they share about their family life. Just a few hours after the images were published around the world, the couple announced they have named their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. 
As they start life as a family of three, we take a look at what's next for the Sussexes. 
The Duke and Duchess moved into Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Frogmore House next to Windsor Castle in April. The Grade II-listed property, most recently used as accommodation for royal staff, underwent large-scale structural refurbishment to create a spacious and secure home. With the 5,000-acre Great Park next door, the area offers the Sussexes a rural lifestyle. However, the main streets of picturesque Windsor are often teeming with tourists, so the family may prefer to spend leisure time behind closed doors with friends. George and Amal Clooney, parents to toddler twins, have a home 30 minutes away. The Duchess's mother, Doria Ragland, who was with the couple at Frogmore Cottage after Archie was born, will be a frequent visitor, although her home will continue to be LA. The Sussexes' offices, where their private and press staff are based, are at Buckingham Palace, 25 miles away. 
Members of the royal family don't have fixed maternity and paternity leave, instead they work with staff to create a timetable allowing them to spend time with their newborn and return to duties when appropriate. Prince Harry's visit to The Netherlands to launch the one year countdown to The Invictus Games The Hague 2020 on May 9, when his son is three days old, reflects how important this cause is to him. However, his working timetable is likely to become quieter over the summer. The Duchess's leave will be some months, however, an aide said that “she may make some official appearances during this time”. The Duchess could join royals for The Queen's official birthday parade, Trooping the Colour, on Saturday June 8. The couple are also expected to be photographed at a christening for their son, though this is not classed as an official appearance. 
When Prince Harry was six months old, his parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana took him to Venice with brother Prince William on an official visit, and plans are in the works for Archie to carry out his first trip at a similar age. If this goes ahead, we could see the family travel to Africa in the autumn, although which country or countries is understood to still be under discussion. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took Prince George to Australia and New Zealand when he was almost nine months old and have since travelled with Prince George and Princess Charlotte to Canada, Germany and Poland. While Prince Harry has made it clear he hopes for a relatively “ordinary” upbringing for his child, as members of the royal family the Sussexes will participate in royal life. Calendar staples include visiting Balmoral over the summer and attending church on Christmas Day at Sandringham. 
Both The Duke and Duchess have made it clear that using their profiles to make a difference is hugely important to them. A recently announced collaboration between Prince Harry and Oprah, co-creating a mental health documentary series, sets the tone for ambitious projects with a global reach. In the run-up to their son's birth, the Sussexes used their newly-launched Instagram account, @SussexRoyal, to mark Mental Health Awareness Month in the US and Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK by only following a small number of accounts doing work in this field. They posted: “Each month we will honour this same concept and change the accounts we solely follow based on a different theme or cause.” The Duchess of Sussex is patron of four charities, two handed to her by The Queen, as well as vice president of The Queen's Commonwealth Trust. With Prince Harry as the Trust's president, who also holds the role of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, the couple are expected to play a prominent role in the 53-member Commonwealth with a particular focus on young people. 
Looking further into the future, discussions have taken place about the Sussex family spending extended periods overseas, potentially in one of the Commonwealth countries in Africa. A palace source said this idea is still in a workshopping phase. Rather than be a permanent move, any stint abroad would likely follow a similar pattern to when then Princess Elizabeth and The Duke of Edinburgh spent time in Malta in the early years of their marriage.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced the birth of their first son on May 6, and have now released photographs of themselves with their child at Windsor Castle 
On May 6, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced the arrival of their first child together, a boy, who was born at Frogmore Cottage. Just two days post the delivery, the couple have released pictures of their newborn with the world, and the photographs have been worth the wait. 
Captured at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle, near Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Frogmore Cottage home, the pictures show the new parents smiling for the cameras with their child cradled and wrapped in a white blanket. While the new mother made her first post-baby appearance in a classic monochrome look (a tie-up white midi worn with nude pumps), Prince Harry held their son wearing a classic grey suit. Prior to the photos being released, Prince Harry revealed that the baby was "a little bit overdue" in his video announcement. 
“It's magic. It's pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world so I'm really happy," the Duchess has said. "He has the sweetest temperament, he's really calm. He's just been the dream, so it's been a special couple of days. Thank you everybody for all the well wishes and kindness, it just means so much.” How has being a parent been so far? “It's great. Parenting is amazing. It's only been two and a half days, three days, but we're just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy.” 
Markle's mother Doria Ragland was present at Frogmore Cottage during the time of the birth, and was said to be "overjoyed" but the arrival. She has, since, been living with the couple and their newest family member, who is soon to meet Prince William and Kate Middleton as well. In a recent interview, the Duke of Cambridge also shared his joy at the birth of his nephew, welcoming younger brother Harry to “the sleep deprivation society that is parenting”. The little royal will also soon be meeting his great grandparents, the Queen and Prince Philip. “We just bumped into the Duke as we were walking by which was so nice," Markle revealed. "So it'll be a nice moment to introduce the baby to more family, and my mum's with us as well.” 
Here's a closer look at the British royal family's newest member. If you can't tell which parent he looks like just yet, you're not alone. “We're still trying to figure that out. Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks. We're basically monitoring how the changing process happens over this next month really. But his looks are changing every single day, so who knows,” Markle told the media with a smile. "He's already got a little bit of facial hair as well – wonderful," added proud father Prince Harry.

The reality of global warming and the disastrous effect of human activities on the natural world can no longer be ignored 
The UN released a must-read, landmark biodiversity report on Monday that you might have missed. With news of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's baby and the Met Gala dominating media in the United States, you might not have seen that about one million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction due to human development. And the consequences for human life itself are profound, affecting issues like food security and clean water around the world. 
According to Media Matters, major US news networks neglected to report on the findings on Monday. The organisation reports that, of major cable and news outlets, “three of the networks—ABC, NBC, and MSNBC—aired no prime-time coverage of it, while the other three networks each aired one prime-time segment. Out of 26 total prime-time news programs on the networks, only three reported on the UN assessment.” 
The report was compiled from thousands of scientific studies by hundreds of experts, and was approved by the United States and 131 other countries, part of a body called the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It is reported that 1,500 pages will eventually be released; on Monday, in Paris, members of the platform released a 40-page summary, and what they found is incredibly disturbing. 
Among the sobering results from the report: The average abundance of native plant and animal life has fallen by 20 per cent or more, mainly over the past 100 years. Human activities such as farming, logging, poaching, fishing, and mining—with the global population exceeding seven billion—are altering the natural world at a rate “unprecedented in human history.” We could lose 40 per cent of amphibian species, one third of marine mammals, one third of reef-forming corals, and more than 500,000 land species—around one million total. The current extinction rate is “at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it has averaged over the past 10 million years.” 
And global warming has been worsening the rate of loss due to human activity; roughly five per cent of species worldwide are threatened with climate-related extinction if global average temperatures rise two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. (We are already at one degree of warming.) 
“If climate change were the only problem we were facing, a lot of species could probably move and adapt,” Richard Pearson, an ecologist at University College London, told The New York Times. “But when populations are already small and losing genetic diversity, when natural landscapes are already fragmented, when plants and animals can't move to find newly suitable habitats, then we have a real threat on our hands.” 
Though the loss of Earth's natural habitats and inhabitants is tremendous, the cost to human life and survival is another concern. “For a long time, people just thought of biodiversity as saving nature for its own sake,” Robert Watson, the chair of the IPBES told the Times. “But this report makes clear the links between biodiversity and nature and things like food security and clean water in both rich and poor countries.” 
What did the report offer in the way of prescriptions to combat extinction? Though that was not the point of their work, the authors made it clear that “transformative changes” were required to reform the world's economic systems and production in order to do damage control. Initiatives to protect specific species from extinction are no longer effective. The world needs to work together to curb consumption, agricultural production, and economic activity like logging and fishing. 
On the heels of the movement to adopt a resolution to create a Green New Deal in the United States, and after last year's harrowing IPCC report on the world's carbon emissions and rising temperatures, the biodiversity report is more than sobering. “It's no longer enough to focus just on environmental policy,” Sandra M Díaz, a lead author of the study and an ecologist at the National University of Córdoba, in Argentina, told the Times. “We need to build biodiversity considerations into trade and infrastructure decisions, the way that health or human rights are built into every aspect of social and economic decision-making.”

News of the birth of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s first child was met with a flurry of congratulations from everyone—and a message by Prince William that all new parents will relate to 
After keeping the nation on tenterhooks well past his due date, the royal baby finally made his entrance into the world on Monday May 6, and messages of congratulations have been flooding in for new parents Meghan and Harry ever since—along with a well-timed dad joke. 
The latter came from father of three Prince William, who told reporters on Tuesday how pleased he was to welcome his younger brother to “the sleep deprivation society that is parenting”. William and Kate, who were attending an event at the Cutty Sark in London to launch their inaugural regatta, The King's Cup, said they were “absolutely thrilled” for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and excited to meet the newest addition to the royal family. 
The Duchess of Cambridge, who gave birth to Prince Louis last April and Princess Charlotte in May 2015, said: “It's a great time of year to have a baby. Spring is in the air.” 
The couple said they were looking forward to meeting their new nephew “in a few days when things have quietened down”. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved out of the grounds of Kensington Palace, where the Cambridge family still reside, and into their new Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage, last month. Meghan's mother Doria Ragland is understood to be staying with the new parents in Windsor as they settle into life as a family of three. 
Michelle and Barack Obama, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and the cast of Suits, the TV show Meghan used to star in, are among those to have publicly congratulated the couple on the arrival of their baby boy. 
Meghan and Harry's first child, whose name is yet to be revealed, was born at 5.26am on May 6, weighing 7lbs3oz (~3.2kgs). Prince Harry, who was at Meghan's side for the birth, said the couple were “overjoyed”, and described their new arrival as “to die for”. They are expected to announce the name of their son, who is seventh in line to the British throne, on Wednesday—and give the world its first long-awaited glimpse of baby Sussex.

In a recent interview, Saif Ali Khan spoke about a game Taimur Ali Khan has invented, inspired by Mumbai's paparazzi 
At just two years old, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan is a celebrity in his own right. The toddler manages to catch the paparazzi's attention no matter where he goes, be it a wedding, a play date, or the airport, and has more than just a few social media fan pages dedicated just to him. 
In the recent past, both parents have expressed their concerns regarding the amount of public attention Taimur receives on a daily basis, and Saif Ali Khan's latest interview reveals a new detail on the paparazzi's effect on their son. Having picked up on terms like 'media' now, Taimur has a new game he likes to play, and it's inspired by the camera men he encounters on an almost daily basis. "Timtim is more media-savvy than either Bebo [Kapoor Khan] or me," Saif revealed. "He likes to call the photographers 'Mediawale'. He thinks 'Mediawale' is a name and one of his favourite games is to point my camera at people. He will say 'khichik khichik khichik' and pretends to be 'Mediawale'!" 
In a recent conversation, mom Kareena Kapoor Khan too spoke about the topic, revealing that the attention their son receives does make her and Saif Ali Khan uncomfortable. "I don't want [Taimur] to get used to the fact that he is getting clicked, but now he understands it. He hears us say, 'the media is there', and he's picking up words now. Though they have been very kind and remain at a distance, it's a constant movement," she said. "A child is a child and nobody stalks anybody's kid. Of course, we are worried about that and people should know that. Sometimes when I am on shoot, I get to know what he is doing from the pictures that the media clicks and that's a bit scary," the Veere Di Wedding actor added.

From Katy Perry's outfit change encounter with Jennifer Lopez to Deepika Padukone's walk to the pink carpet, here are all the inside Met Gala 2019 moments you missed out on. Plus, inside pictures from the after party hosted by Gucci 
It's that time of the year again! New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art lit up with stars today on occasion of the 2019 edition of the annual Met Gala, a celebration of fashion and art that guarantees a slew of unmissable pink carpet moments. Like every year before it, the Met Gala saw musicians, actors and fashion enthusiasts go all-out with their looks to match its dress code, which, this time around, was "Camp: Notes on Fashion". Given the theme, extravagance was the aesthetic everyone went with, and the guest list did not disappoint. In case you still haven't been able to figure out what camp really means, here's an explanation. 
While you may have already seen what your favourite stars wore to Met Gala 2019 (there's really no way you could have missed Priyanka Chopra's feather-meets-shine Dior gown or Deepika Padukone's Barbie-esque pink number), few have been able to access all the action from inside the gala and the after party, hosted by Gucci, which seemed like an absolute blast. Feeling a little FOMO? Here's a look at everything you missed. 
If there's one star whose look we won't be forgetting anytime soon, it's got to be Katy Perry. The singer walked into the Met Gala this year dressed as a chandelier, crystals and all, but that wasn't the end of it for her. During the course of the evening, Perry rushed to the restroom for a quick outfit change, ditching her chandelier ensemble for a shimmering burger costume. One hilarious video shows Perry stepping into her quirky outfit as Jennifer Lopez walks by. Another video you may have missed shows Lady Gaga theatrically shedding layer after layer on the pink carpet, showing the shutterbugs all the four (yes, really!) outfits she picked for the celebration. 
As part of the Met Gala Benefit Committee, Priyanka Chopra made it a point to go all-out with her look this year, opting for a feather-detailed Dior number, which she amped up with the most intense eye makeup. Prior to walking the pink carpet, the actor shared a peek at her beauty look via a dramatic selfie video (have you seen a more Bollywood-style eyelash flutter?), and some of her unseen moments from the evening also show her hanging out with husband Nick Jonas. As for Deepika Padukone, one video that seems to be taking over the internet shows the star making her way out of her hotel like the tallest life-size pageant doll you've ever seen. This particular video clip of herself twirling during fittings is one you've got to check out. 
Along with special performances, a few of the Met Gala 2019 guests were seen exploring the museum's exhibition on camp in fun videos shot by US Vogue. While one video shows sister Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian West laughing away while striking a pose, another shows Gigi Hadid experimenting with her model walk. Dressed in a sparkling Michael Kors ensemble, Hadid makes a very interesting subject. 
One of the most exciting aspects of the Met Gala has to be its star-studded after-party. Hosted by Gucci this year, the post-event celebration saw a slew of celebrities come together, and one of the first inside pictures to take over the internet shows Deepika Padukone (dressed in a yellow maxi and graphic print coat) spending time with Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas. While Jonas changed his all-white look for a black suit, Chopra replaced her Dior gown with a silver romper, but left those rhinestone-studded tights on for the party. Joining them in the picture was one more Met Gala 2019 guest: Natasha Poonawalla.

We won't blame you if you're laughing out loud at your desk 
If there ever was a Met Gala theme perfect for meme culture, it's camp. "Camp: Notes to Fashion" was as over-the-top as you'd imagine, and the Internet was quick to react. Based on Susan Sontag's essay "Notes On Camp", attendees like Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Nick Jonas, Deepika Padukone, Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Kylie Jenner showed up in their extravagant best to the pink carpet. Their outfits had people comparing Katy Perry to Lumière from Beauty and the Beast, Kylie and Kendall Jenner to the muppets, and Kim Kardashian to a buttery croissant. Priyanka Chopra was reminiscent of the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland and Deepika Padukone channeled her inner camp Barbie on the pink carpet. Perhaps the most meme-d moment of all was Lady Gaga's four outfit changes, which she did on the carpet itself, with an animated performance and props to match. 
The best meme content happens when stars are happy to laugh at themselves. Chrissy Teigen, who didn't attend the gala this year took camp very literally.... 
...and Nick Jonas brought up not one but two pop culture references—to his early 2000s film Camp Rock, as well as to a character in Game of Thrones. His sister-in-law, Sophie Turner (who plays Sansa Stark on the show,) commented on his photo and said, “Quit trying to manipulate me....ugh I thought you died last season.” 
Thanks to the Internet, these are the most hilarious memes from the 2019 Met Gala.

As fashion’s biggest night of the year unfolds, celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, Isha Ambani, Lady Gaga and Celine Dion walk the Met Gala 2019 red carpet in looks you don’t want to miss 
Of the many red carpet events that transpire through the year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala, commonly known as the Met Gala, ranks among the biggest. What started as a fundraising event in 1948 by publicist Eleanor Lambert for the Met Museum has now been dubbed as the ‘Oscars of fashion'. Held on the first Monday of May each year, the modern iteration of the evening sees the best and brightest from the worlds of fashion, music, film, art and sports, among others, to raise money and celebrate the grand opening of the museum's latest exhibition. 
But it's the clothes that make the Met Gala the glamorous spectacle it is. Attendees are encouraged to let the theme of the exhibit inspire their sartorial choices—and year on year, celebrities leave no stone unturned in making sure this appearance generates the most impact. The theme for this year's event: Camp: Notes on Fashion. For the exhibition, Andrew Bolton, head curator, drew on Susan Sontag's seminal 1964 essay, “Notes on Camp”, which is quite a departure from last year's dialogue with religious art and costume. The essay takes a stab at the idea of artifice, style, exaggeration and a kind of winking bad taste, exemplified by figures like Oscar Wilde and outré aesthetic movements such as Art Nouveau. 
Since 1995, the event has been chaired by US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who enlists public figures to serve as her co-chairs. The Met Gala 2019, which marks the event's 71th anniversary, is co-chaired by Lady Gaga, Alessandro Michele, Harry Styles and Serena Williams. 
Actor Priyanka Chopra, who made her Met Gala debut in 2017, along with now-husband Nick Jonas, has been elected as the latest members to join the Benefit Committee this year. Other Indian celebrities to be spotted at the event include Deepika Padukone, Isha Ambani and Natasha Poonawalla. 
Guests have historically played fast and loose with the theme, but camp leaves a lot of room for fun. The dress code for this year was ‘studied triviality', and so far, we have seen raucous colours and exciting silhouettes in high supply on the red carpet. Lady Gaga was among the first to arrive at the scene, making a dramatic entrance in a custom Brandon Maxwell gown. And Serena Williams followed soon post, dressed in a bespoke Versace gown and Off-White neon Air Force sneakers. 
Priyanka Chopra opted for a custom Dior outfit and walked the red carpet with husband Nick Jonas, as brother-in-law Joe Jonas and his new bride Sophie Turner followed suit. Other attendees seen were Isha Ambani, Karlie Kloss, Celine Dion, Lupita Nyong'o and Katy Perry, among others. There's also Billy Porter, who made a noteworthy entrance. And the night is only just beginning. Scroll ahead to check out all the A-listers on the red carpet for Met Gala 2019.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby has been born, the Royal Family has confirmed 
The Royal Family has announced that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have welcomed their first child, a baby boy. The news was just confirmed on Twitter and Instagram. 
“Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex was safely delivered of a son at 0526hrs this morning. The baby weighs 7lbs 3oz. The Duke of Sussex was present for the birth. The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer have been informed and are delighted with the news. The Duchess's mother, Doria Ragland, who is overjoyed by the arrival of her first grandchild, is with Their Royal Highnesses at Frogmore Cottage. Her Royal Highness and the baby are both doing well.”, read the statement. The baby was delivered at 5.26am, weighing 7lbs. 
Unlike royal cousins—Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis—the new royal arrival was born at home, at Frogmore Cottage, instead of at The Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London. (Also unlike his cousins, the new royal family member's birth was not announced on an easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace, favouring instead a digital announcement.) An official statement was released this morning signalling Meghan Markle's going into labour, “The Duchess went into labour in the early hours of this morning. The Duke of Sussex was by Her Royal Highnesses' side. An announcement will be made soon.” 
In a departure from the royal baby traditions observed by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not make an appearance outside the Lindo Wing with their new arrival. The couple revealed weeks ahead of the birth that they wanted to celebrate “privately as a new family” before making the news public. The duchess's mother, Doria Raglan, arrived in the UK after Easter weekend and will be on hand to help the new parents. 
The royal couple first announced that they were expecting their first child last October, five months after their wedding. The yet-to-be-named royal addition is the Queen's eighth great-grandchild, and seventh in line to the throne, behind his grandfather Prince Charles, his uncle Prince William, cousins Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, and father, Prince Harry. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby will not receive the title of prince unless the Queen overrules—Prince Harry's great-great-grandfather King George V limited titles within the royal family in 1917. Instead he will be known as the Earl of Dumbarton. The child's name will likely be revealed in the coming days. Prince George and Princess Charlotte's names were announced two days after they were born, while Prince Louis' wasn't revealed until four days after his birth. 
The new parents are expected to leave hospital in the coming hours, if not days, and settle into family life at their new home at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor. The listed property—which has views of Windsor Great Park and Frogmore House, and famously hosted the couple's wedding reception last year—recently underwent extensive renovations ahead of the family moving in.

Sandy beaches, gorgeous swimwear and sun-kissed snapshots: Here's a peek inside Pernia Qureshi's pre-wedding girls' trip with friends including Masaba Gupta and Tanya Ghavri 
All set to tie the knot later this year, fashion entrepreneur Pernia Qureshi is currently in Tulum, Mexico for her bachelorette along with some of her closest friends including designer Masaba Gupta and stylist Tanya Ghavri. Incase you missed it, Qureshi got engaged earlier this year during a trip to Istanbul, and her pre-wedding girls' getaway has resulted in a slew of picture-perfect vacation moments. 
Qureshi first shared a glimpse at the mood of her bachelorette with a snapshot of customised hats that belong to her bridesmaids, and captioned the Instagram post "All set." Since then, her feed has grown to include vibrant pictures of herself and her girl gang soaking up some sun in Tulum, Mexico, and the bride-to-be has also shared a peek at her beach wardrobe, a collection of printed swimsuits by Masaba, lots of playful coordinated sets and a strong dose of acid pink. Her latest post shows her striking a pose in a hot pink number, captioned "No guesses for my fav colour 💗." 
If you follow Masaba Gupta on Instagram, you may have noticed that the designer too has been treating her followers to photos of the 'Mexican sunrise', scrumptious meals and breathtaking views of the sea. One of Gupta's cutest pictures from the Mexican getaway so far shows her posing by the beach with Qureshi and Ghavri, all dressed in swimwear doused in exotic prints. 
  
During their travels, the ladies have also been seen partying together and enjoying some pool time together. They also visited Pablo Escobar's Mansion in Tulum. 
If you're planning your own bachelorette, this holiday album may just inspire you to add Mexico to your list of must-visit spots. Scroll through our slideshow for a sneak a peek inside Pernia Qureshi's girls' getaway.

The two multi-hyphenates will be co-hosting the soirée with Travis Scott, La La Anthony and Trevor Noah—guaranteeing a covetable guest list and a glamorous night out 
Fashion's biggest red carpet, the Met Gala, is just a few short hours away and while most of the celebrities, athletes, models, socialites, fashion designers and their stylish muses will be busy prepping for the big day, they and their teams of makeup artists, hair and fashion stylists are also sure to be thinking ahead to what happens after the red carpet has been walked, the dinner has been served and the Gala itself has ended. 
Kim Kardashian West is one such celebrity already onto the “what happens next” phase of the Met Gala, tweeting a cryptic, blurry, electronica 30 second video announcing the after party she is set to co-host with tennis champion Serena Williams. 
In the video announcement the 38-year-old beauty entrepreneur writes the date of the after party and the list of names who she will be co-hosting the bash with: “5.6.19 MET AFTER PARTY SERENAxKIMxLALAxTRAVISxTREVOR” 
The video itself provides further clues as to what this all means with copy overlaid on the video announcing it is the “6th annual Gala After Party hosted by Serena Williams, Kim Kardashian West, Travis Scott, La La Anthony, Trevor Noah”. The post also shares that music at the party will be provided by Travis Scott's childhood friend and in-demand DJ “OG Chase B” plus other “surprise guests”. 
For anyone who is lucky enough to have scored an invite to this coveted soirée but has misplaced the details, Kardashian West has also kindly provided the start time, 11pm. 
By the sounds of it, Kardashian West and Williams's party looks set to be one for the ages and will undoubtedly be celebrity central given the A-list status of the two hosts and their co-hosts, pulling all the big names from the Kardashian-Jenner family to Williams's wide circle of friends, including Met Gala regulars like the Clooneys. Sadly, this excludes Williams's good friend Meghan Markle, who won't be in attendance (or even in the US) given she is due to give birth any day now in Windsor. 
Talk show host Trevor Noah and La La Anthony are sure to have the big names in television on the door list, while Travis Scott will be calling on his music buddies to hit the dance floor at his Met Gala after party, possibly celebrating his recent birthday at the same time.

2019's Met Gala will see quite a few women from India on its red carpet. Curious to know who will join Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone? Read on to find out 
We all know the theme for the Met Gala 2019: “Camp: Notes on Fashion” (no, not camp as in sleeping bags and bonfires, but camp as in exaggerated fashion. Learn more about it here). With just hours to go for the annual celebration, fashion enthusiasts all over the globe are gearing up to see which celebrities will walk the Met red carpet this year, and what they're going to wear. If you're a Bollywood fan, you may already know that Deepika Padukone has already left India for New York (the actor flew out this weekend in a denim jumpsuit and hot pink heels), and will, of course, be joined by Priyanka Chopra and husband Nick Jonas. 
Recently, Chopra also took to her Instagram account to confirm her and Jonas' presence at the 2019 Met Gala, announcing that the couple is also part of its Benefit Committee, along with the likes of Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry. 
But if you thought Padukone and Chopra are the only famous Indian faces you'll see at the Gala, you're in for a surprise. Reports claim that Isha Ambani, entrepreneur and daughter of Nita and Mukesh Ambani, will be attending the Met Gala 2019, as will philanthropist Natasha Poonawalla. This won't be either of their first walk down the Met Gala red carpet. Back in 2017, we saw Ambani attend the gala in a stunning golden gown by Dior along with Emma Roberts, and in 2018, Poonawalla made an appearance at the celebration in a quirky strapless number too. Here's a picture Poonawalla shared on her Instagram page recently, hinting at her Met Gala comeback. 
Given her love for all things avant-garde, it's safe to say that Poonawalla will go all out to do this year's Met Gala dress code justice. What will Isha Ambani wear to go with 2019's theme? Stay tuned for more updates. 
Will the Met Gala 2019 red carpet be as camp as we hope it to be?

Yesterday, HBO released fresh images of everybody's favourite murderesses after Killing Eve's Villanelle: Madeleine MacKenzie (Reese Witherspoon), Celeste Wright (Nicole Kidman), Jane Chapman (Shailene Woodley), Renata Klein (Laura Dern), and Bonnie Carlson (Zoë Kravitz). Joining them for the second instalment of Big Little Lies? Every key member of their respective families—from the world's coolest primary schooler Chloe MacKenzie (Darby Camp) to Madeleine's ex-husband (and Bonnie's current one) Nathan Carlson (James Tupper). The most important cast members, however, might just be the newest residents of Monterey. Ahead of the second—and likely final—series on June 10, read on for a breakdown of the most significant clues about what exactly will happen in the wake of that deadly fundraising event. Pour yourself some Chardonnay, because it's about to go down. 
Patron Saint of Cinema Meryl Streep is naturally the most significant person to join the cast of Big Little Lies. Stepping into the role of Mary Louise Wright, the mother of the now-deceased Perry, she's come to Monterey determined to figure out what happened to her son—which, fair enough. Taylor Treadwell has also been cast as a younger version of Celeste's mother-in-law. Given that Treadwell appears in five episodes, it's pretty clear that this is going to be quite a retrospective series. 
Little has been confirmed about Michael Perkins beyond the fact that he's a second-grade teacher at Otter Bay Elementary School. However, according to a casting breakdown forwarded to talent agencies last year, he's a man with a social conscious who butts heads with Renata when he accidentally gives daughter Amabella a panic attack after a lesson on global warming. Here's hoping he's basically a foil for the more ridiculous elements of Renata's personality. 
Corey Brockfield is a quirky surfer and aspiring marine biologist who also happens to be Jane's coworker (although Jane does work as a freelance bookkeeper, so that raises some questions). He makes a wetsuit-clad appearance in the first trailer for the series, asking her, “You're one of the Monterey Five, right?” Cue a frantic murderess summit in some sort of luxury vehicle, with Jane telling Renata he said it in a way that implied the gang all had “scarlet letters” on their backs. 
Elizabeth Howard, mother of the troubled Bonnie, will make her first appearance this season, played by Crystal Fox. Fans of Liane Moriarty's bestseller will be aware that Bonnie's rash decision to push Perry over the cliff at the end of the novel is triggered by her own history with violence: in short, her own father is abusive. While the TV adaptation of Big Little Lies neglected to mention this fact, the appearance of Bonnie's mother in the next series makes it pretty clear that her back story is finally going to be explored in more detail. Further evidence for this theory? Martin Donovan will star in two episodes as Bonnie's father Martin Howard, with Mykal-Michelle Harris playing a young Bonnie in four episodes. 
As with Ira Farber, little has been revealed about the character of Katie Richmond. However, there was a call for talent to play the role of a female member of the school administration who becomes close with Jane and learns her “deepest secrets”, and it seems highly possible that Poorna Jagannathan might well have stepped into that role. The question is, will Jane's closeness with someone outside the Monterey Five make the rest of the ladies raise a glass—or serious eyebrows? 
In a town full of mysterious people, Ira Farber might just be the most mysterious. Not only are there no details about his character to date, there's no sign of how frequently he will appear in Big Little Lies' second installment. Will he be a love interest? A run-of-the-mill titan of industry? A server at one of Renata's parties? The possibilities are endless. It seems most likely, however, that he will somehow be involved in digging into the case against the Monterey Five. 
So, this is cheating, because Tori Bachman did of course appear in the first series of Big Little Lies. As Joseph Bachman's wife, she confronts Madeline about her relationship with her husband. The fact that she's returning seems a clear hint that Madeline's affair with the head of the local theatre company is far from over. Another, far more overt, hint: Madeline is seen making out with someone who looks an awful lot like Joseph in the latest trailer. (Side note: why does the Monterey Bay Aquarium get so much action?)

The Love Actually actor attended a party in Paris this week wearing an outfit that showed off her growing baby bump 
34-year-old actress Keira Knightley is reportedly pregnant with her second child with husband, James Righton, People reports. 
The Oscar-nominated Pirates of the Caribbean actress is already mum to daughter, Edie, who turns four this month. 
According to People, when the actress stepped out at the Chanel J12 cocktail party in Paris on Thursday evening she showed off her growing baby bump in an ethereal cream gown. Holding hands with her husband of six years, People said she was later seen “cradling her belly.” 
According to the publication, although they reached out to the Bend It Like Beckham's representative, the actress is yet to respond to their request for a comment. 
Knightley is notoriously private about her home life, marrying Righton in an intimate ceremony in France in 2013. According to one witness speaking to People, the wedding was a short service attended by “very few people.” 
Knightley and Righton's daughter, Edie, is also rarely photographed and Knightley doesn't share details about her during interviews, but has shared that she thinks being a mum is very difficult. “I don't think we give women enough credit for the physical and emotional marathon they go through when becoming a mother,” the actress said in an interview People reports, adding, “I come from a place of amazing privilege. I can afford good childcare and yet I still find it really f— difficult…[but that] doesn't mean I don't love my kid.” 
Congratulations to Knightley and Righton!

Stepping away from tradition to keep their first child’s birth private, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have earned Oprah Winfrey’s approval for “standing up for what works” for them 
As the world awaits the arrival of the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex's first child, Oprah Winfrey has praised the couple's choice of birthing plan. “I'm so proud of her decisions,” Winfrey said at The Hollywood Reporter's Empowerment in Entertainment Gala on April 29. “To be able to stand up and say this is what I really want for my baby and my family, and now I'm going to do it a different way when it's been done that way for a thousand years? I'm just so proud of her.” 
Meghan and Harry have moved away from tradition by opting to keep the birth private before announcing the news. Last month, Buckingham Palace released a statement declaring that “Their Royal Highnesses have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private. The Duke and Duchess look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.” Other royals, such as Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, have always posed for photographs on the steps of the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London, hours after the arrival of their three children. 
Winfrey, who was a guest at the couple's wedding in May 2018, praised the pair's efforts in “standing up for what works” for them, and “how they're going to raise their baby.” She continued to allude to the pressure placed on women after giving birth. “Who is ready to walk out and stand before the world and put that face on, you know, a day after you've had a baby? I think for her and him—I'm sure it was a mutual decision for the two of them—I think it's a great thing.”

Jennifer Lopez and Malaika Arora have been giving us fitness goals for a long time, and will now be more involved in the world of wellness 
Jennifer Lopez and Malaika Arora both owe their rock-hard physiques to a regular yoga practice, and now they have both joined hands to invest in an Indian-based yoga and wellness startup called SARVA. The startup was created by Sarvesh Sathi, who built the brand with the ultimate goal of building a global community of physically, mentally, and emotionally fit people, achieved through yoga and mindfulness. At this point, the Chennai-based company boasts 90 studios across Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru, on track to open 500 brick and mortar studios in 15 cities across the country. The next step also includes building a digital platform. 
Arora recently partnered with SARVA to found Diva Yoga, which is a yoga studio concept for women only. Since it opened its doors in late 2018, Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Yami Gautam have made it to classes. Arora has then continued her relationship with SARVA as she said in a statement, “I am happy to look beyond and invest in SARVA, becoming a part of the overall company that comes with a vision of connecting seven billion breaths globally, using finesse and a hi-tech approach.” 
Jennifer Lopez, whose fiancé and former baseball player, Alex Rodriguez has also invested in SARVA said in a statement, "I have personally benefited from my regular practice of yoga and believe that it has made a difference to my life both physically and mindfully.

Blake Lively surprised everyone as she walked the red carpet for her husband’s new film, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, with a baby bump 
Blake Lively has revealed she is pregnant with her third child, revealing her baby bump while on the red carpet. Lively, 31, stepped out for the New York premiere of Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, where she posed in a sequinned yellow dress that showed off her new bump. 
Lively was attending the premiere alongside her husband, Ryan Reynolds, who stars in the film as its main character. 
This will be the couple's third child, as they are already parents to two daughters—James, who is four, and two-year-old Inez. 
The couple are yet to comment on the news and didn't make a statement while on the red carpet. However, at the Tokyo premiere, Reynolds told Entertainment Tonight it was actually one of his daughters who encouraged him to take the role. 
“[The filmmakers] sent me this fully rendered Detective Pikachu and they married it and paired it with my voice from dialogue from Deadpool,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “So I'm watching and looking at this completely hyper-realistic photorealistic Detective Pikachu on my computer, and my daughter kind of cruises by and is glued to it." 
“She made us watch it a hundred times in a row. So I was kind of in, even if the script was literally made of old spit I would have been like, ‘Yup, I'm doing it. I'm in,'” he added. “I need more of that validation from my child.” 
Of course, this news means we can now expect a pregnant Lively to walk the red carpet at the Met Gala on Monday May 7—as if we weren't already excited enough to see what look the actress would be pulling off!

After marking Prince Louis’ first birthday with never-seen-before pictures, the royal family shares new portraits of Princess Charlotte to celebrate her fourth 
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's baby may not have arrived yet, but royal watchers have something to tide them over—three new portraits of Princess Charlotte. 
“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share three new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fourth birthday tomorrow,” Kensington Palace wrote in a statement. “The photographs were taken in April by the duchess at Kensington Palace and at their home in Norfolk.” 
Two of the photos show the princess enjoying the outdoors. In one, she leans against a fence, smiling sweetly in a gray sweater as tree branches dangle in the background. In another, she laughs while holding a daffodil. 
In a third, she sits in the grass, wearing a blue floral dress and matching shoes. Her hair is adorned with a navy ribbon. 
The portraits come a little over a week after new photos of Prince Louis were released for his first birthday. Those were taken in Norfolk, at their home of Anmer Hall, as well. 
Their country estate is the site of many important photographic family milestones—the Cambridge family Christmas card was also taken on the Anmer Hall grounds.

An Instagram post by Mira Rajput Kapoor has raised interest about the celebrity couple’s plan to move to a new apartment. Here's what we know so far 
One of Bollywood's most-loved couples, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor may be moving to a new home soon. Parents to two, the two currently reside with their children in a sprawling beachfront property in Mumbai's Juhu area, but reports suggest that they have bought another one in Worli—a duplex apartment on 42nd and 43rd floor of Three Sixty West's Tower B. Along with giving the Kapoors a view of the sea (just like their present-day home), this property will also make them neighbours to other celebrity couples from Juhu like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna, and Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. 
Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor have been away on vacation for a while now, but that hasn't stopped them from working on their new home—they've even dropped hints on social media about the same. On Sunday, Mira Kapoor took to Instagram to share a picture with husband Shahid Kapoor. Though it's not clear what they might be looking at, it was the caption that caught their fans' attention, reading “Building a dream together #workinprogress”. 
Rumours suggest that the Kapoors have approached Gauri Khan to decorate their new home. Recently, the interior designer shared a picture with the celebrity couple from when they visited her store, captioning it, “Perfect setting for my new collection with Shahid and Mira. Thanks for dropping in.” In another post, she wrote, “‘Jab We Met' Mira and Shahid at #gaurikhandesigns. All grace and charm. @mira.kapoor @shahidkapoor.” 
Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor got married in 2015 and are now raising their two young ones, Misha, two, and Zain, seven months. Last seen in Batti Gul Meter Chalu, Shahid Kapoor will be next seen in Kabir Singh, set to hit theatres on June 21.

Stuntman, actor, stunt double, sword master, fight choreographer, Night King—Vladimír Furdík’s (the actor who plays the formidable Game of Thrones character) Instagram bio is as expansive as Daenerys Targaryen’s title 
Who's that guy? You know, the quiet one with the piercing blue eyes? Oh, you're talking about the Night King. 
The horseman from the Lands of Always Winter made his final move on last night's Game of Thrones (spoilers ahead, obviously), the invasion of Winterfell for which the citizens of the North—and fans—have been preparing since Season 1. And though he didn't make it through, thanks to one incredibly agile Arya Stark, everyone was talking about that calm, cool, collected horned equestrian in the mockneck tunic, and what he was like when he wasn't bringing back the undead. 
Thankfully the Night King has an Instagram account—or, rather, Vladimír Furdík does, the Night King actor who has played TNK since Season 6. 
Furdík is a Slovakian stuntman who appeared in the show in battle scenes before assuming the role of the Night King in 2016. In addition to enjoying stunt sword fights and medieval street style, Furdík loves horses. Just look at him gently kiss this four-legged friend on the snout: 
And here he is saying that “the most beautiful view in the world is from the horse's back.” 
Furdík is apparently a major figure in the Slovakian stunt scene, and according to IMDB, his nickname is Furdo, and his star sign is cancer. Also, he's hot? Here he is stunt-doubling for Nicolas Cage. 
And with Channing Tatum. 
Fans are catching up that the Night King did not actually shatter into a million pieces of ice last night, and are currently filling the comments on Furdík's page with heart eyes emojis and compliments like, “Cool daddy look.” Beware, Night King: The night is dark and full of DM slides.

Student of the Year 2's new song sees Alia Bhatt make a special appearance alongside Tiger Shroff. Don't miss the duo's chemistry in the 'Hook Up Song' video 
Student of the Year 2 hits theatres on May 10 and ahead of its release, the film's cast and crew has been sharing sneak peeks from the film to get fans as excited as possible. Starring Ananya Panday, Tiger Shroff and Tara Sutaria, the romantic comedy-drama comes to us seven years after Student of the Year released, and if you loved the high school drama full of picture-perfect sets and eye-catching costumes, you're bound to enjoy watching its sequel. 
In case you missed it, SOTY 2's cast have already released some of the film's catchiest songs, which include 'The Jawaani Song' and festive favourite 'Mumbai Dilli Di Kudiyaan'. Today, Dharma Productions has dropped the music video of one more upbeat track, 'Hook Up Song'. The highlight: Instead of Panday and Sutaria, this video sees Tiger Shroff romancing a star from the original Student of the Year, Alia Bhatt. Dressed in a host of party-ready mini dresses and play suits, the actor, who made her Bollywood debut with SOTY along with Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra, seems to share undeniable chemistry with Shroff in the music video. 
Student of the Year 2's 'Hook Up Song' has been on everyone's mind over the past few days. While Bhatt shared a teaser from the song two days ago, Shroff has been posting stills from the song on his own Instagram page. What's more, the duo even have their own hashtag now: #Talia.

On the heels of releasing her book I've Never Been (un)Happier, Shaheen Bhatt dives deep into a conversation about depression, how it has affected her family and work, and how it has strengthened some of the biggest relationships in her life 
Shaheen Bhatt has always been candid about her struggles with depression and anxiety since she shared her thoughts in an internet-breaking Instagram post in 2016. “'Ive lived with depression on and off since I was about 13 years old. This is not a revelation or a confession. Those who know me know this about me. It's not something I take any pains to hide, I'm not ashamed of it or particularly troubled by it. It's just a part of who I am. I have days where I feel good and then I have days where I don't,” she had said. After writing a book about her experiences and journey through depression called I've Never Been (un)Happier in 2018, Bhatt opened up to show host Rajeev Masand on the couch at her home about specific instances in the book, the moment that affected her self worth the most, and how her sister Alia Bhatt will always be on her side. 
In the most poignant part of the interview, Masand picked out a specific incident from the book, "In the book, you talk about this incident and it's just heartbreaking where you talk that once you and Alia, your younger sister went to a photoshoot with your elder sister, Pooja Bhatt and at some point the photographer asked you to leave the picture because the two of them looked similar, they were fair, cute and you were dark having spent too much time in the sun and you were a little overweight. And you said that till date, looking at those pictures cripples you emotionally." Bhatt responded, saying, “It's making me uncomfortable right now as you are talking about it. You know, women, in general, suffer a lot. Shame, I think is the core of depression and it could be any form of shame, and with women, I think body image also tends to be one of the causes for shame. Shame is central and I wish I could make people understand that shame is central to any kind of negative feelings, depression and sadness. It stops you from being vulnerable and you constantly fear that if you will show yourself as you are, you will be rejected by society. And my self-worth was definitely affected because I was at an age where the seeds of that were sown in me." 
She says that Alia is her “primary source of comfort,” and continues by saying that her younger sister always played a protective role. "She has always been really understanding to what I have been through. She was always that bridge between mum and me. When I was younger, mum would be banging on my door, and Alia would say, just leave her alone. She was always my lawyer, and that persists through this day. She always tells people to lay off me when needed." Shaheen also spoke about Dear Zindagi, where Alia played a young woman needing therapy to cure her insomnia, “I was very curious to see how they portray therapy in a Bollywood movie, and I think they did a really good job. Before she started shooting the film, we sat down, and she said she wanted to pick my brain a little bit.” 
Bhatt also talks about her relationship with fellow depression advocate, Deepika Padukone, “She's a really generous person. I've spent a very short amount of time with her, but she has been so warm and so lovely to me, and I think it is incredible. She was one of the first people to really talk about depression so openly. It does strengthen your relationship with people that have gone through things.”

Alia Bhatt recently spoke about her experience working with Ranbir Kapoor and how he inspires her to be a better version of herself. Don't miss this 
Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor have been on every Bollywood fan's radar for a while now. Back in 2018, the duo made their first public appearance together for Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's wedding reception, and it wasn't long before Kapoor confirmed their relationship in an interview. Since then, the Bollywood couple has opened up about their relationship in several ways, be it via Alia Bhatt's mushy speech at the Filmfare Awards (where she confessed her love for Kapoor), or at the Zee Cine Awards, where the two were seen sharing an adorable peck. Now, in a recent interview, Bhatt also spoke about how working with beau Ranbir Kapoor in Brahmastra was a magical experience. 
"I have always loved Ranbir as an actor—he's just so fabulous on screen, he's powerful yet so honest and complete," Bhatt said. "I'm feeling that even while we work together. It's so nice to just see him be. He really inspires me to be a better version of myself at work. His work ethics are commendable and I'm still learning from him. I'll continue learning from him. Even with Bachchan sir, who's so giving and professional as an actor, it's been amazing. His voice can alone give you goosebumps. The world is relatable. Brahmastra is not going to be a film, it will be an experience." 
Talking further about Kapoor, Bhatt said, “I'm actually very glad that the first time he and I are coming together is for a film like this. There was a time when I used to think—‘When will I get to work with him? What will happen?' And then this happened. Also, it has been a while since Brahmastra was conceptualised—it was five years ago right after Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani. That was also the time Ayan [Mukerji] and I bonded. It was a very big moment for me when he offered me this part. I wasn't who I am today then but he still trusted in me. It was a big deal for me and from that day to now, I have always looked forward to being on that set everyday. Because it's a new challenge each day and it has given me abandon as an actor. I have always felt that when Ranbir and I come together, it has to be magical and literally, it can't get more magical than this. I'm saying all this with great hope and not being pompous about it. We're working very hard towards that.” 
If you've been waiting to see Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor's on-screen chemistry, however, it looks like you will have to wait a little longer. On April 27, Mukerji shared a statement on his Instagram account sharing the news that the film is now set to release in the summer of 2020 since the VFX team needs more time to work on the project. Besides Hindi, the film will also be released in Tamil and Telugu.

On her eighth wedding anniversary to Prince William, Kate Middleton received a new honour from The Queen—an appointment to the Royal Victorian Order 
Kate Middleton celebrated her eighth wedding anniversary to Prince William on April 29, which also marked eight years since she became an official member of the royal family. Queen Elizabeth II chose to mark the special day by bestowing on Kate Middleton a new honour, one that recognises the Duchess of Cambridge's incredible dedication to her work as a royal. 
The Queen has chosen to appoint the duchess a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO). “The Queen has been pleased to make the following appointment to the Royal Victorian Order,” said a statement from Buckingham Palace. It added: “Awards in the Royal Victorian Order are made personally by The Queen, for services to the Sovereign.” 
In other words, the honour recognises Kate Middleton's services to The Queen and are bestowed by Her Majesty directly. A Dame Grand Cross also happens to be the highest rank in the Order—it is equivalent to a Knight. 
The royal family's website describes it as a “personal gift” of the Sovereign, which makes it all the more special that it arrived on The Duchess's wedding anniversary. The website also states it is “awarded to those who have served The Queen or the monarchy in a particular way.” 
Middleton joins other members of the royal family before her who have been recognised in this way, including the Duchess of Cornwall, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and even Prince Harry and the Duke of Edinburgh. 
The honour also means the Duchess of Cambridge earns a new accessory that can be worn to formal royal events like state banquets. She is now permitted to wear the blue sash of the Royal Victorian Order, in addition to the yellow badge she has previously worn which signifies her appointment to the Royal Family Order (see above picture) and is, as per the royal family website, “small portraits of the Sovereign attached to ribbon, gifted to Members of the Royal Family.” 
Congratulations are in order for the Duchess of Cambridge and we can't wait to see how perfectly that new blue sash goes with a tiara at the next formal affair.

Since the royal couple couldn’t attend Idris Elba’s wedding, they sent over a thoughtful wedding present to celebrate his big day. Scroll ahead to find out what it was 
In case you weren't on Instagram this past weekend, Idris Elba married his partner, Sabrina Dhowre in a beautiful wedding in Marrakech, Morocco. Their nuptials, which took place on April 26 at the Ksar Char Bagh, should have been attended by royalty, considering Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are fond friends of Elba and his now-wife, Dhowre. (You might remember Elba and Dhowre attended the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle last May and even confirmed he was the DJ at the reception). As we all know, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are currently based at their home, Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor, as they await the arrival of their first child, so they were not able to attend the wedding. This didn't stop them from sending across a thoughtful wedding gift though, as The Daily Mail reveals. 
As per a report from the publication, the Duke and Duchess gifted the newlyweds a piece of art to celebrate their big day. The piece is said to have been by the Connor Brothers and cost £7000, or Rs 5,92,000. 
While The Daily Mail doesn't reveal how they discovered the information, the publication goes onto confirm the exact piece of art—which they say is a “1950s-style romantic book cover” that features a Marilyn Monroe-esque cartoon woman alongside the words, ‘Why fit in when you were born to stand out?' See it here. 
The message behind the art certainly rings true as something the Duchess of Sussex would want to impart to her newly married friends, however, with no confirmation of the source, we're not quite sure what to believe. But given the royal couple missed out on the three-day celebration of their close friends, we're certain they did in fact send across something special to make up for their absence. 
Dhowre wore a white off-the-shoulder Vera Wang dress and Elba wore an Ozwald Boateng suit for their wedding, which will feature in the July issue of British Vogue. Vogue.co.uk confirms Dhowre wore a second dress by Vera Wang on the day, which, like her first dress, was custom, and featured embroidery, pearls, gemstones and lace. 
See more from their big day below.

Ahead of baby number four’s arrival, the reality TV star threw a baby shower that included CBD and Yeezy slides for all of her celebrity guests 
Kim Kardashian West and her husband, Kanye West, are expecting baby number four via surrogate sometime in May, and ahead of baby West's arrival the 38-year-old beauty entrepreneur threw a baby shower that was extremely chill and also so 2019, it can now become the entry into the time capsule defining the year. 
Multiple sources say the couple are expecting a son and while the reality star is an experienced hand at motherhood—she and West are parents to North West, 5, Saint West, 3, Chicago West, 1,—the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is reportedly “freaking out” about baby number four which explains the theme of her baby shower: “CBD & Meditation”. 
People reports Kardashian West invited her famous friends including Chrissy Teigen, Paris Hilton and Jen Atkin and family—mum Kris Jenner and sisters Kourtney and Khloé Kardashian—to her house on Saturday for the CBD (a naturally occurring plant-based cannabidiol currently trending in alternative medicine circles for its reputed calming properties) and meditation-themed shower, confessing to her guests why she was throwing such a, er, chill baby shower. 
“So, because I'm freaking out and the baby is coming in, like, two weeks, I thought what better way to celebrate than to have a little CBD,” People reports the reality star said by way of a welcome to her guests. 
The soirée also included a group sound bath—a type of meditation involving immersion in beautiful sounds and vibrations that reportedly heal the body—and People reports guests were each gifted navy blue Yeezy slides in line with the “it's a boy” party decorations that were reportedly all in shades of blue. 
Guests were also invited to make CBD body oil and try their hand at flower arranging while also partaking in a little CBD. 
“I thought it was kind of ridiculous to have a fourth baby shower,” People reports Kardashian West told guests, “But I thought I'm freaking the f—out having a fourth kid...So everyone have a puff and put on some oil.” 
The reality star took to Instagram on Sunday to share details of the party on Stories including her gratitude to her guests for coming to the party and for making it so “perfect!”.

Are sisters-in-law Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle not getting along? Despite what the tabloids have to say, the royals have an answer, one powerful photo op at a time 
All is not rosy in royal land. Rumours of rifts—amongst brothers, sisters-in-laws, families, countryside-society sets—have plagued the Windsors for months now. The usually mum Kensington and Buckingham Palaces are issuing rare denials. “This never happened,” they told The Sun after they ran a story that Meghan and Kate had an “explosive row.” They're addressing rumours. “Any future plans for The Duke and Duchess are speculative at this stage. No decisions have been taken about future roles,” they said about a Times of London report that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may move to Africa. They're blocking out-of-control trolls on social media who spew—often racially tinged— vitriol and malice. They're reportedly threatening lawsuits. 
The British royals are no stranger to scandal. There's a reason The Crown will have several seasons. But this has been the hardest hitting, and continuous, moment of chaos for “The Fab Four”—Prince Willam, Kate Middleton, Prince Harry, and Meghan Markle—the foursome that's the future of the family. The very foursome that brought the magic of the monarchy to a new generation, with their fairytale weddings, and their precocious, perfect-seeming families. Now, they don't seem so magical anymore. 
There are many weird things about the senior royals (those closest in line to the throne). One of the weirdest, at least to this American, is that despite being really freaking famous, they rarely do interviews. Sure, they'll offer soundbites for documentaries, or chat briefly with fans and reporters during appearances. They'll give speeches. But when your average celebrity might employ a cover profile or TV show appearance to tell their side of a story (See: Jennifer Aniston's post-Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie affair interview with Vanity Fair, or Justin Bieber's post-monkey incident cover with GQ), the royals tend to stay silent. (Noteable exception: Prince Harry's Newsweek interview.) It's just not their go-to tool in the public relations arsenal. It's just not how things are done.

British, American, or both? We find out 
Here's some breaking news for you: Prince Harry is British. His wife, Meghan Markle, is American. This manifests itself in various ways—like chic wedding invitations on British stationary with American ink; like living in England, but hiring an American manny; or like, maybe having a child of royal Windsor blood who's also a citizen of a country that overthrew the monarchy! 
Yes, the question of the baby's passports is making its way around the Internet: Will Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's baby be an American citizen? Since the royal baby watch has reached a whole new level as of late (recently, a psychic used asparagus to predict the duchess would have twins), let's dissect! 
When Meghan Markle became engaged to Prince Harry, Kensington Palace told the BBC that she would become a citizen of the United Kingdom: “She intends to become a UK citizen and will go through the process of that, which some of you may know takes a number of years,” said their communications secretary Jason Knauf. Since Markle only wed Harry in May 2018, it's almost certain she still remains an American citizen, which means that Baby Sussex will be born to one British parent and one American parent. 
Since their child will be born on UK soil to a British parent, it will be a British citizen. But what does the US State Department say about a baby born overseas to one American parent and one foreign parent? Here we go: “A person born abroad in wedlock to a US citizen, [writer's note, Meghan] and an alien [writer's note, Harry] acquires US citizenship at birth if the US citizen parent has been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions prior to the person's birth for the period required by the statute in effect when the person was born.” 
That last part is a little confusing: “period required by the statute in effect when the person was born.” Basically, the rules change depending on if the baby was born before or after 1986. After 1986, the American parent must have lived in the United States for five years, at least two of which being after the age of 14. Markle, who grew up and lived in Southern California, meets this requirement. 
So, yes, the baby will be an American citizen. But according to The New York Times, there's still some paperwork required to make it official. “There's a form that they fill out, which is called the US consular report of birth abroad, and that then serves as the child's proof of US citizenship. With that, they are also eligible to apply for a passport,” Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, told the outlet. 
This is apparently fine with the British government. “You can apply for foreign citizenship and keep your British citizenship,” as written on its website. And, according to the US Embassy and Consulates in the United Kingdom, an individual can hold more than one passport of differing nationalities. (Most people consider a double-passport holder a “dual citizen.” Although “US law does not mention dual nationality,” there is no formal stance for or against it.) 
To sum it up: if Meghan and Harry would like their child to hold an American passport, it seems like they can. But the key word is “if.” If the royal baby is an American citizen, it will be subject to American taxes—which would put financial scrutiny on the Windsor family. As CNN reports, “US tax inspectors could scrutinise Harry and Meghan's royal wealth, and the income of their newborn child.” 
Plus, as the State Department points out, “Claims of other countries upon US dual-nationals often place them in situations where their obligations to one country are in conflict with the laws of the other.” Will being seventh in line to the British throne and an American ever be at odds with one other? 
Baby Sussex will be the first child for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and also the first Anglo-American child in the upper ranks of the British monarchy. So, in this unprecedented situation, perhaps only time will tell.

Everybody may be chopping their hair off to debut shorter, summer hairstyles, but Kylie Jenner was never one to follow the crowd 
Spring is in the air and, with the shift in temperatures comes the annual desire to make a change. When it comes to hair, that often means getting a chop, but beauty risk taker Kylie Jenner is making the case for putting down the shears, showing off a new set of longer than life lengths on Instagram yesterday. 
Just days after Coachella, where Jenner reinvented the festival braid with a series of charms hanging from her single waist-grazing plait, the beauty mogul is taking her hair down. Jenner's thigh-grazing lengths accompanied a white fringe bodycon dress, all blowing in the Calabasas wind. 
While the social media star rarely shies from a quick change—flip flopping from platinum pixies to crimson-colored bobs with the help of a few stealth wigs and extension pieces—this latest switch-up is perfect for breezy summer moments. Jenner captioned her photo, "Good hair = good day," and we couldn't agree more.

As you wait for the Night King to arrive at Winterfell, HBO has released six unseen pictures from the upcoming episode of 'Game of Thrones' to get you ready. Don't worry, no spoilers here 
The last season of Game of Thrones has not just its characters, but its fans too standing on deathwatch. The Battle of Winterfell is here, and we're all thinking about what's going to happen next. Adding to that anticipation, HBO has released new sneak peek photos from the upcoming episode three. 
Just four episodes left to go in the series, last week's episode ended with all the characters preparing (in their own way) for the huge fight against the Night King and the Army of the Dead. And in these new photos, Sansa Stark looks, well, very concerned. The newly-appointed knight of the Seven Kingdoms, Ser Brienne of Tarth is seen leading her men along with Jamie Lannister. Jon Snow is standing in front of fire with a shocked expression on his face, and Tyrion Lannister is in the crypts with Lord Varys. The last photo that gives an aerial view of the ancestral home of the Starks, shows Daenerys Targaryen standing with Jon Snow looking from a hill top as the Night King enters Winterfell. 
The showrunners seem to be holding their cards very close to their chest, as with days to go before it airs, Game of Thrones season 8 episode 3 still does not have a title. All we really know about it is that the creators have said the episode's epic battle scene was inspired by Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and also revealed that it took an unprecedented 55 nights to film under brutally difficult conditions, plus weeks of in-studio filming. 
The episode will be the longest of season eight as well as the longest episode in history of the series, with a runtime of 1 hour, 22 minutes. The episode will stream in India on April 29 at 6.30am on Hotstar, and as there are sure to be some deaths, this Monday morning is going to come with its own set of blues. 
Scroll through our slideshow to see the new photos from the episode and get another look at the upcoming episode.

Diljit Dosanjh's latest song is an ode to two women: Kylie Jenner and Kareena Kapoor Khan. Find out how Kareena Kapoor Khan reacted to the song now 
Diljit Dosanjh may have caught the Indian film industry's attention in 2016, but he's been a regular on Punjabi music charts for much longer than that. The musician-turned-actor is also an established television presenter and social media star. If you're one of Dosanjh's 6.7 million followers, you may already know that the 35-year-old has a soft spot for Kylie Jenner, and has spoken about his feelings for the entrepreneur and beauty icon on several public platforms, even rapping about her in his 2018 song, 'High End'. Now, Dosanjh is back with a fresh new track which spotlights his appreciation not just for Jenner, but also for Bollywood actor Kareena Kapoor Khan. If you've been waiting for a new song to add to your weekend playlist, this just may be it. 
Titled 'Kylie & Kareena', Dosanjh's latest dropped on YouTube on April 24, 2019, and has already taken the internet by storm. Within two days, the song has earned close to 700,000 views, and is currently the top track on iTunes. 
How did Kareena Kapoor Khan react to it? Dosanjh recently revealed that he kept the song a secret from the actor, saying, "I wanted to surprise to her. When the song was ready, I played it to her and showed her the video as well. She loved it. Kareena Kapoor Khan is my favourite Bollywood actress. Just like Kylie Jenner, Kareena ma'am is the only one." 
Dosanjh made his Bollywood debut with Udta Punjab in 2016, which also starred Kareena Kapoor Khan. The two will be seen sharing screen space once again in upcoming film Good News. "[Kapoor Khan] has performed really well in Good News," Dosanjh said in an interview. "Despite being she is such a big actor, she is so down to earth and she treats everyone with lots of respect on the sets." 
Recently, Kapoor Khan also spoke about Dosanjh on talk show Koffee With Karan. When asked who she'd choose between Diljit Dosanjh and rapper Badshah, the actor chose the former as he worked on his first Bollywood film with her. Haven't watched the video of 'Kylie + Kareena' yet? Hit play below.

“This is your Nuremberg moment. Justice isn’t inevitable. It doesn’t just happen. And it doesn’t stand a chance if people in power, including those at this table, don’t make it a priority,” she said in her powerful speech 
Amal Clooney delivered a passionate speech on preventing sexual violence being used as a weapon of war at a UN meeting in New York on April 23. The activist and human rights lawyer challenged the UN members to vote in favour of a resolution against sexual violence in conflict as America tried to veto the measure. 
Clooney, who was representing Yazidi survivors (an ethnic Kurdish group) of sexual violence, sat next to human rights activist Nadia Murad Basee Taha. Murad, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, was raped and tortured by members of Isis and her family were murdered. “This is your Nuremberg moment. Justice isn't inevitable. It doesn't just happen. And it doesn't stand a chance if people in power, including those at this table, don't make it a priority,” Clooney said, urging the members to vote in favour. 
The US removed all references to sexual and reproductive health in the resolution. In the lead up to the debate, the Trump administration opposed a phrase in the resolution believing that it implies support for abortion: “Recognising the importance of providing timely assistance to survivors of sexual violence, urges United Nations entities and donors to provide non-discriminatory and comprehensive health services, in line with Resolution 2106.” 
The original resolution has also been championed by other public figures. France's UN ambassador Francois Delattre said that America's proposed amended resolution undermined the dignity of women. Actor and activist Angelina Jolie penned an op-ed with German foreign minister Heiko Maas in the Washington Post advocating the resolution, writing: “[It] would be a much-needed step toward ending impunity for sexual violence in conflict” and “send an important message to those who attempt to roll back human rights.” 
Clooney, who has been representing Yazidis since 2017, continued: “This is your chance to stand on the right side of history. You owe it to Nadia and the thousands of women and girls who must watch Isis members... go back to normal life, while they the victims never can.” The amended resolution passed 13-0, with Russia and China abstaining. 
Last month, Clooney was appointed as a special envoy for the UK government. The new role will see her highlight attacks and restrictions placed on journalists around the world. Previously, Clooney fought for journalist Khadija Ismayilova to be released from prison following her arrest due to her investigative work. Following the trial, Ismayilova was released in 2016.

Vogue decodes the outfits from Student of the Year 2’s newly-released song, ‘Mumbai Dilli Di Kudiyaan’, starring Ananya Panday, Tara Sutaria and Tiger Shroff 
Student of the Year 2 is undoubtedly one of the most talked about movies this year, with a promising cast that debuts both Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria, starring alongside Tiger Shroff. The movie's newest song ‘Mumbai Dilli Di Kudiyaan' released today, featuring the trio in a festive mood as they dance along (and even grape stomp) to the catchy number. 
Their costumes, designed by Manish Malhotra, complement the colourful ambiance—Panday and Sutaria are seen in vibrant bikini style blouse and lehengas, while Shroff wears an embroidered sherwani with trousers in pastel shades. Panday's embroidered number in shades of tangerine is slightly more daring, courtesy the no-dupatta look. 
Sutaria, on the other hand, opts for a contrasting pink and orange dupatta worn with her strappy bikini blouse and embellished lehenga in a lime green. The eye-catching risqué factor in their skirts has to be the thigh-high slit that allows freedom of movement as they sway to the music. 
Coming to their choice of accessories, both girls are seen sporting colourful earrings to accentuate their outfits. Additionally, Ananya Panday wears a haath phool on one hand, while Tara Sutaria stacks up on tassel-detailed bangles on both hands. Strong eye makeup rounds off both girls' beauty looks. Got a sangeet ceremony coming up this summer? Bookmark Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria's playful, vibrant lehengas to make sure you stand out.

It's official: Actor Arjun Rampal and girlfriend Gabriella Demetriades took to Instagram recently to announce their big news with a beautiful picture 
After being spotted on several dinner dates, red carpets and weddings together, actor Arjun Rampal and girlfriend Gabriella Demetriades have taken over social media feeds once again. This time, the couple shared big news on their official Instagram pages: they are expecting their first child together. The Rock On!! star posted a sweet black and white picture of himself and Gabriella, captioned, "Blessed to have you and start all over again...thank you baby for this baby". Reports state that the couple started seeing towards the end of last year. 
South African model-turned-designer Gabriella Demetriades is the name behind fashion label Deme by Gabriella, which has in the past been worn by the likes of Sonakshi Sinha, Kriti Sanon, Malaika Arora and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, among others. Reports state that the designer started seeing Rampal towards the end of last year, after he announced his separation with wife Mehr Jesia in May 2018. 
On the work front, National Award winner Rampal was most recently seen sharing screen space with Jackie Shroff and Esha Gupta in war film Paltan. Demetriades is currently hosting AXN original series Twinning.

To get fans ready before Avengers: Endgame releases this week, Marvel Studios shared a Twitter thread of all their post-credit sequences. We tell you why it was a notable update 
It's a very exciting time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe right now. As the countdown to Avengers: Endgame draws closer (we're at t-2 right now, people!), MCU's biggest players spent the last few months serving treats in the real world to include the rest of us in the thrill. Last May, Robert Downey Jr told an American publication that “five of original six Avengers got a tattoo”, referring to the Avenger logo he, Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner got inked on their skin (Mark Ruffalo “opted out”). And just days ago, Brie Larson and Scarlett Johansson walked the red carpet at the Endgame premiere sporting versions of Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet on their hands—Larson picked a golden Irene Neuwirth cuff with five jewelled rings featuring tourmaline, aquamarine, and emerald; while Johansson complemented her glittering Versace chainmail dress with a one-of-a-kind Sonia Boyajian cuff with chains connecting to multiple rings. With its superheroes going all out to commemorate the much-anticipated end show, the mothership was clearly not going to be left behind. To add their own spin to the promotions, Marvel shared an all-inclusive thread of every single MCU post-credit on Twitter with the caption, “From the end credits to the end game...”—the perfect description, if you ask us. 
For loyal fans of the immensely popular franchise, the end credit scene was one of the highlights of the entire experience of watching the movies. So it might be disappointing to some that according to rumours, Avengers: Endgame will conclude sans post-credits—the first Marvel movie without a visual teaser stacked at the end. 
It doesn't take a die-hard fan to know that this is critical information, since these post-credit sequences have become core to Marvel's identity, always giving hints to the audience about what can be expected next. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) ended with Nick Fury contacting Captain Marvel on a pager, Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) saw Scott Lang trapped in the Quantum Realm without his friends, and Captain Marvel (2019) saw Carol Danvers meeting the Avengers in the present after answering the page. (You can see all of them on the Twitter thread, here.) Considering Endgame marks the end of Phase 3 for MCU (we recently learned that Marvel Studios would refer to their first 22 films as The Infinity Saga), it makes sense that the creators have skipped on the post-credits because there's nothing left to tease fans with before the commencement of Phase 4. 
But all is not lost. There's talk on the grapevine about a mid-credits scene, and maybe even a post-film montage of Marvel's first MCU decade and everyone who made it what it is today. Another theory says that there is just an audio stinger at the end, when the Marvel logo appears. Mostly expected to be the sound of metal hitting metal, this one is open to interpretation, but it has been suggested that the clang is reminiscent of Tony Stark forging his first Iron Man armour. Guess we'll just have to wait to find out what makes it to celluloid.

Ahead of his first birthday, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge share three new photographs of Prince Louis—clicked by Kate Middleton herself 
Prince Louis turns one on April 23—and, to celebrate, Kensington Palace has released new portraits of Britain's littlest royal. 
“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to share three new photographs of Prince Louis ahead of his first birthday tomorrow,” they wrote in a statement. 
Taken by mother Kate Middleton, they show Louis in Norfolk, near the Cambridge family home of Anmer Hall. In one, he wears a blue sweater with a dog stitched on the front. 
The others show a prince at play, this time wearing red. In one, he stares adoringly into the distance, while sitting on a moss-covered rock. In the other, he laughs mid-crawl—his emerging baby teeth on full display. (Earlier in January, Prince William revealed his son was in the midst of the teething stage. When given a baby helicopter toy during a public appearance, William said “Louis will be chewing that before long!”) 
The Duchess of Cambridge is often the photographer for her children's official photographs. Last April, she shot Prince Louis's debut portrait, as well as one of the newborn with Princess Charlotte for Charlotte's third birthday. 
It is the first time the public has seen Prince Louis since the Cambridge family Christmas card back in December. There, the Cambridges posed upon a tree branch on the grounds of Anmer Hall. Louis, perched on his mother's lap, grinned at the camera. 
The next few weeks are landmark ones for the Windsors. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will welcome their first child imminently. Although the couple is keeping the birth private, they will share a photo “once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.” On May 2, Princess Charlotte will turn four—and it's assumed the public which will be treated to new pictures of the princess. And just like that, the world falls a little bit more in love with the new generation of the monarchy.

Once they’ve settled into life as a family of three, it seems the Duke and Duchess of Sussex may head overseas 
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are expected to be days away from welcoming their first child but that hasn't stopped them from planning a move overseas. Reports surfaced over the Easter break that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex might be relocating to a Commonwealth country in Africa. 
The rumour of a move abroad started with a report by The Times in the UK, which shared “courtiers have drawn up plans to hand the Duke and Duchess of Sussex a major international job that could see them moving abroad after the birth of their child.” As per the report, Prince Harry's advisers have been looking into “bespoke” roles for the young royal couple in Africa, that would see them promote Great Britain on behalf of the Commonwealth while also working for overseas charities related to causes close to their hearts. 
The report said the plan has been “drawn up” by Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to the US. 
The news circulated over the Easter break, causing Buckingham Palace to make a statement—however, they did not deny the report. “Any future plans for The Duke and Duchess are speculative at this stage,” the statement said. “No decisions have been taken about future roles.” 
The exact timing of their relocation seems to be unclear—the original report suggested a 2020 move but subsequent publications have suggested it could be within a few months. 
Either way, it's not altogether out of the blue—Africa has a shared special meaning for the couple, who travelled there together just weeks after their first date in 2016. “I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana. We camped out with each other under the stars,” Prince Harry revealed in the couple's engagement interview in November of 2017. “She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.” 
They visited Africa again in 2017, where together, they helped with the conservation of elephants, choosing to share a photograph of this trip on their new Instagram account during a larger post on April 5. “Their Royal Highnesses travelled to Botswana to assist Dr. Mike Chase of Elephants Without Borders in equipping a bull elephant with a satellite collar,” the Instagram note confirmed (see below and scroll through the Instagram gallery to see the picture). 
As per reports, the relocation would likely be to a Commonwealth country in Africa, where they would use their platform to appeal to young people, driving awareness to various causes in the area, with elephant conservation seemingly just the beginning. 
Meanwhile, Prince Harry attended the royal family's traditional Easter church service on Sunday amidst the rumours, with his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, notably missing in action. With news her mother, Doria Ragland, is now in town, it seems the duchess was resting her feet at their home in Frogmore Cottage, near Windsor, as they (and the world) await the birth of baby Sussex.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and husband Abhishek Bachchan celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary in the Maldives with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan. See all the pictures now 
April 20 marked Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan's 12th wedding anniversary and to celebrate the occasion, the couple (along with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan) flew over to one of their favourite holiday destinations, the Maldives. During their time off together, the duo also made it a point to share a few snapshots from their family getaway with their Instagram fans, and the album has received lots of love on social media. On Friday night, Abhishek shared a gorgeous snapshot of wife Aishwarya wearing a blue gown and statement necklace, which he captioned "honey and the moon", but one of the Bachchans' sweetest photographs from the getaway had to be this one, which shows them smiling with little Aaradhya. 
How did Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan spend their time away from Mumbai? Between taking photographs of one another, the couple enjoyed swimming sessions with their daughter, and also spent a few sunsets by the beach. Having returned to Mumbai, the duo are continuing to post throwback pictures from their travels on their Instagram pages, giving their fans some major vacation envy. 
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan's relationship has come a long way since the stars first met in 1999, while doing a photoshoot for Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke (2000). “It was our first film together, and I expected a diva. Instead, she was disarmingly wonderful,” Abhishek once said in an interview. Abhishek proposed to Aishwarya in New York in 2007, and their wedding was easily one of the most talked-about nuptials in Bollywood. 
Till date, the couple have starred in eight films together including Dhoom 2 (2006), Umrao Jaan (2006), and Guru (2007). According to reports, the couple will be seen in a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie together soon.

Months after their own wedding in Lake Como, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh were seen attending a wedding in Mumbai. Don't miss their pictures and videos 
It's hard to believe it's already been close to four months since Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh tied the knot in Lake Como. Following their nuptials, the couple have been busy with different projects, including Singh's Gully Boy, and Padukone's next film, Chhapaak. Between their busy schedules, the newly-weds came together today for a very special personal event, a wedding which was held at Mumbai's JW Marriott hotel. 
Dressed in a white sari patterned with vibrant pink blooms, Deepika Padukone looked radiant alongside her husband at Namita Masurkar's wedding with Mihir Manjeshwar. Padukone wore her ivory sari with a matching halter blouse, pearl -detailed earrings, and had her ebony locks pulled into a severe low bun. Singh, on the other hand, greeted guests and congratulated the couple in a red and black ensemble. The couple were also seen taking pictures with the bride and groom's little cousins. Scroll through Instagram and you'll notice the hashtag #NamitaWedsMihir has already started taking over social media with inside images and videos from the wedding celebrations. This particular clip shows Padukone and Singh walking up to the bride and groom's mandap to meet their families before taking a seat for the wedding ceremony. 
The overall design and decor was executed by Mumbai-based brand DreamKrraft Wedding, where the entrance of the wedding venue bore a larger-than-life neon signage with the names of the couple. Inside, a deconstructed mandap saw single-strand cascading floral vines, crafted entirely out of white and red blooms. A floral backdrop in the shape of Lord Ganesh took centre stage behind the mandap. What's more, the wedding also featured a live artist who was seen creating live portraits of the couple at the venue, while a flutist and a harpist serenaded the guests. Missed all the pictures from #NamitaWedsMihir?

Turns out, the celebrated tennis player has been investing in women-led companies since 2014 
Serena Williams has long urged women to “dream crazier”, fight for equality and push boundaries. Now, the 23-time Grand Slam winner has revealed a secret she's been keeping for five years: she's been investing in women-led and diverse companies everywhere. 
In an Instagram post on April 17, Williams detailed the work her company, Serena Ventures, has been conducting since 2014. “In 2014, (yes, I know I can keep a secret) I launched Serena Ventures with the mission of giving opportunities to founders across an array of industries. Serena Ventures invests in companies that embrace diverse leadership, individual empowerment, creativity and opportunity.” 
To date, the company—which Williams started with Alison J Rapaport—has already invested in over 30 businesses, including Billie, a female-owned razor company, and Lola, another female-led reproductive health subscription firm. “Serena Ventures focuses on early stage companies, giving them the opportunity to be heard,” the company's website reads, making it clear that it aims to help young start-ups. “As we grow, we hope to mentor young founders and take burgeoning entrepreneurs to the next level. Serena Ventures extends relationships, encourages collaboration among portfolio companies, and expands partnership opportunities across my vast network.”

As the final series of Game of Thrones airs, Vogue catches up with Maisie Williams about life on set and the wildly anticipated conclusion of the blockbuster fantasy 
Really, really exciting but also really confusing. 
Just working with Sophie [Turner]. She makes me laugh until I actually cannot breath. All the way through shooting, we've clung to each other, and our friendship has just gotten better and better as we've gotten older. 
Quite drastically. In the beginning, this was such a man's game. Now it's a big old catfight—particularly the final series. 
When I was 12, I thought it was a great idea to play Arya left-handed because she favours that side in the books. Eight years later, and I'm still paying for that mistake. I had to keep it up for continuity. In the beginning, I just had to do a little sparring. Now, I'm doing entire fight sequences with the wrong hand, and I'm like, "Why did I ever think this was a good idea?" 
Either “winter is coming” or “stick him with the pointy end”. Sometimes people also ask me, “What's your name?” and when I say Maisie Williams, they're like, “No! A girl has no name.” It's embarrassing. 
Just how fearless and outspoken she is. She always says what she means. I've tried to be the same way, but it's kind of difficult in real life when people have emotions—and answer back. 
When Jon Snow died. Part of me always felt like he was going to come back though. That said, there are some things coming up in the final season that are pretty groundbreaking. 
A tortoise—and the motto would be “Go Hard or Go Home” because their home is their shell which is also... hard. 
Ygritte because she was the hottest red head, and Rose [Leslie] is just so funny and a darling. 
Probably Circe—which sounds kind of dark, but her answer to literally everything is just to open a bottle. That's relatable! 
The Night King. I mean, those cheekbones. Chiselled by the gods. 
This character without a name who gets his head squashed by the Mountain for bragging about seeing Cersei naked during her Walk of Shame. No one remembers him. That's the best possible way to do a cameo in a series. 
Sansa. She's always really wanted it, even though it's never been within reach. Plus, she's a redhead. 
Cold, memorable, and dragons.

Take a look inside with Vogue 
It's been close to two years since Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan welcomed a baby boy into their family, but the fascination with Taimur Ali Khan continues to grow by the day. Whether the toddler is attending a wedding, enjoying a horse ride or just accompanying his parents to the airport, Taimur's every move makes it onto social media within minutes. 
You may not remember it, but back in 2016, pictures of Taimur Ali Khan's nursery, designed by Ritakshi of Bibs N Cribs, were released on social media, no doubt inspiring the rooms of many babies in the country. Featuring a customised crest for the little Pataudi, the baby's pristine white crib was seen sitting in a cosy room with white furniture and earthy wallpaper.

The two-year-old's sister, Sara Ali Khan, took to Instagram recently to share an adorable, never-seen-before snapshot of both her brothers spending time together, captioned, "My Easter Bunnies 🐇🐰🥚#munchkins #brothersinarms#doubletrouble". The picture shows Taimur sitting in his cot wearing an orange T-shirt as Ibrahim Ali Khan poses for the camera with his arms around the toddler. Look beyond the brothers and you'll get a closer look at Taimur's soothing brown and beige wallpaper, along with a row of family photographs that decorate his room. Pictures include snapshots of his parents Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan holidaying with him in Switzerland, the Pataudi Palace and other locations. Other decor elements in Taimur's nursery also include a little Mickey Mouse stuffed toy, and a deep blue couch.

As Meghan Markle’s due date approaches, we wonder if the new royal baby would be a look-alike of its father, Prince Harry, or the mother 
From speculation about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's alternative birth plan to rumours about what the baby's gender will be, everyone has been waiting for the birth of the royal baby with bated breath. The couple first announced that they're expecting a new arrival in the family last October on a royal tour to Australia, inciting a wave of curiosity. There has been a lot of talk about the Duchess of Sussex's birth plan since, and it is believed that she is exploring a natural delivery. Markle is supposedly working with a doula—someone who provides emotional and physical support during childbirth. Details of their nursery being an eco-friendly space, equipped with high tech gadgets, have also come to light. 
As the Duchess' date comes closer, many people may have found themselves in heated discussions on whose iconic features will be most reflected in the little one's face. Considering it's not too far-fetched to imagine that it's going to be somewhere along the middle, we searched the internet to find old pictures of both parents and help you imagine a likeness, till we actually get to see the baby. Scroll through our gallery for some of Harry and Meghan's sweetest childhood images.

Two years after her hush-hush trip to Delhi, unseen pictures and a video of the Duchess of Sussex dressed in a sari and talking about women's hygiene have been doing the rounds recently. Take a closer look below 
Even before she became the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle was everyone's radar. If the American actor wasn't being followed for her red carpet looks, she was trending for her popularity on television series Suits and of course, her much-talked-about relationship with Prince Harry. In the midst of it all, Markle also caught India's interest when she made a hush-hush trip to the country back in 2017 as part of her charity work with the organisation World Vision Canada. 
It's a known fact that the 37-year-old is a vocal feminist, and during her India trip, Markle used her time to highlight issues surrounding gender equality, and also spoke about women's hygiene and girls' limited access to education in India during her five days in the country. One of the most exciting pictures to come from her trip was one that showed her hands painted with traditional mehandi designs. And now it turns out, Markle tried more than just henna during her travels. 
Fresh pictures from the Duchess' 2017 India visit show her spending time with local women dressed in a traditional Indian sari, complete with a matching bindi and bangles. Markle sits draped in an ombre green and blue version of the Indian staple, which she paired with a beige sari blouse with elbow-length sleeves. 
A recently released video also shows the Duchess enjoying a traditional dance performance. Reports state that Markle spent her time in Delhi and Mumbai meeting with children from several schools and NGOs, and was also seen helping kids paint murals and plant flowers in gardens. During one of her school visits, Markle is seen speaking directly into the camera about girls being forced to drop out of school because of a lack of bathrooms. "What we found is that the enrolment at this school went up three times once the latrines were built so that girls had access to clean hygiene and bathroom facilities while they're at school," the Duchess observed. The tour also had Markle meet with Shamina Shafiq, a former member of the National Commission for Women, and be introduced to the Myna Mahila Foundation, which works with women who reside in Mumbai's urban slums.

From Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s viral on-stage kiss to Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s record-breaking selfies, here’s proof that Cupid does exist 
Given that their lives are almost entirely spent in the limelight, it comes as no surprise that the world's most famous celebrity couples are especially protective of their love lives. But lately, many have opened up about their relationships to the point of indulging in Bollywood-level PDA. While newlyweds Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh shared a sweet kiss at a recent awards function, Shah Rukh Khan can still often be spotted gushing over his wife, Gauri Khan, even after 17 years of marriage. Always on the go, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas like to dial up the virtual love every once in a while as well. Need a little reminder that love is what it's all about? Here's a look at some of your favourite celebrity couples' cutest PDA moments. 
Abhishek Bachchan's secret to wooing one of the most beautiful women in the world involves the simple, yet oft-forgotten art of routinely appreciating her. On the eve of his daughter Aaradhya Bachchan's recent birthday, the actor acknowledged his wife's efforts with an Instagram post that read, “A child's birthday cannot be complete without appreciating her mother. For giving birth to her, for loving her, taking care of her and basically just being a Wonder Woman! To the Mrs, thank you for giving me the greatest gift ever... our daughter!” His wife, meanwhile, reciprocated the gesture in her own way by sharing cosy couple pictures on her Instagram, choosing to let a string of emojis do all the talking for her. 
This duo may have tried to keep their relationship under wraps for their first few years of dating, but their frequent moments of PDA served as a dead giveaway. You won't need to reach too far into your memory to remember the visual of Singh serenading Padukone outside a party with a yellow rose. After making things official with several star-studded wedding parties last year, the couple hasn't held back. Singh's performance in Padmaavat earned him the Critics Award For Best Actor at a recent ceremony, with his proud wife handing over the trophy with a kiss.

After successfully managing to keep their relationship away from the public eye, this young couple seems to now be making up for lost time. Further proof to that end can be found with a quick scroll through their Instagram handles—from getaways spent exploring the wonders of Los Angeles to their joint appreciation of edgy sneakers, they clearly have lots in common. Post their summer wedding last year, Ahuja has been gunning for the ‘Husband of the Year' title, changing his name to ‘Anand S Ahuja' and hyping his wife on Instagram. “Every week you do something that just outdoes what you did the week before!” he raved in a recent post. Did you miss this especially cute picture of the two on holiday recently? 
Their wedding in Italy may have been hush-hush, but these days, #Virushka loves giving their collective 56 million Instagram followers regular peeks into their charmed life together. While star cricketer Kohli breaks records on the pitch, his wife is busy creating new ones on celluloid. Kohli is known to take to the social media platform to talk about the positivity Sharma brings to his life. “The person that inspires me to push forward despite all obstacles. The person that guides me to do the right thing in life against all odds. The person that has changed me inside out and made me realise the power of true love. My strength. My soulmate,” he proudly stated in an Instagram post. You'll often see these two exploring new cities hand-in-hand, and soaking up some sun while lying in each other's arms during their travels. 
After their paths crossed at an award show after-party, Nick Jonas wasted no time in wooing Priyanka Chopra. Not quite ready to make things official right away, the duo left a trail of breadcrumbs in the form of flirty Instagram comments (remember when Jonas commented, “That smile” on a photo of Chopra at her favourite burger joint?). They ultimately held a grand celebration of their love in Jodhpur with multiple ceremonies last year, and Chopra made things Insta-official by changing her name to Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Ever since, the newlyweds have been packing on the virtual PDA. Whether they're sharing a kiss in front of the Mercedes Maybach Jonas just bought his wife. or walking hand-in-hand on the streets of Miami, this couple looks picture-perfect all the way. Friendly reminder: Get yourself a guy who will toast your successes and look at you like this while you have your moment in the spotlight. 
With a filmy love story that played out like one of his on-screen romances, it stands to reason that 17 years have done little to dull the spark in Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan's marriage. The couple set the stage on fire with their performance on the popular track, 'Dilli Wali Girlfriend' at Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's wedding, proving that sometimes, chemistry just grows with time. The little tidbits of affection continued on social media during their recent Spanish vacation, with Shah Rukh sharing one of their rare selfies together; “After years the wife has allowed me to post a pic I have taken… she's all heart!” read the caption. Want more of their sweetest PDA moments? You can't miss their adorable pictures from 2017's Vogue Women Of The Year Awards. 
After Nick Jonas tied the knot with Priyanka Chopra, all eyes are on Joe Jonas, who seems as in love with fiancée Sophie Turner today as he was when the duo first got together. Having met through Instagram DMs when Jonas messaged the Game of Thrones star out of the blue, the two have been setting relationship goals ever since they started dating. Their PDA isn't what you're used to. Turner and Jonas have stepped out sporting matching nail paint in the past, and have also sealed their love for one another with matching tattoos. In case you missed it, these two got inked in October 2018 with Toy Story-themed tattoos that come together to spell out ‘To infinity and beyond'. Doesn't get cuter than this. 
You won't find them gushing over each other on social media, but Saifeena has never shied away from being vocal about their love. At a recent panel, Kapoor Khan spoke about her husband's unwavering support in the challenging period post the birth of their son, Taimur Ali Khan; “I'd really like to thank Saif. I was extremely exhausted after childbirth. The first thing is you want to put your child on your chest to give warmth to the child. With my eyes half-shut, I would say, ‘Saif, put Taimur on your chest. Give him that kangaroo love'.” In front of the camera, the duo present a stately image befitting his royal lineage, often picking coordinated his-and-hers outfits. Case in point: Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's wedding had the couple stepping out in matching ivory looks—an embellished Anita Dongre lehenga for her, and a high-collared sherwani for him. This picture proves that sometimes, eye contact is enough PDA. 
Though this couple likes to insist that they lead a normal life, their love for each other takes every day from basic to beautiful. Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor met through their parents before tying the knot in Delhi in 2015, and in just four short years, their family has grown by two. The duo first welcomed an adorable baby girl, Misha, and celebrated the birth of their son, Zain, seven months ago. Today, the happy family serves up a picture-perfect portrait on Instagram, merrily navigating the maze of parenting with grocery runs and gym dates while still finding time for mushy selfies. Those searching for proof of love need look no further than the actor's 38th birthday, which had his wife posting an adorable selfie on Instagram with the caption: “Thank you for being the most loving husband and friend, for loving me through all my stages and sizes, for spoiling our babies silly with unconditional love and attention, for making sure you remain silly so we can all laugh till our stomachs hurt, for picking me up when I'm down and for tipping me over when you're looking to make a joke. To the most hardworking, humble and resilient soul. For the one who has so much love to give, I pray God blesses you with even more.” 
After dating for two years, former baseball player Alex Rodriguez popped the question to Jennifer Lopez recently during an intimate getaway, and the proposal took over the internet like wild fire. Whether they're on a red carpet or the sets of her upcoming movie, Hustlers, the two can't seem to keep their hands off each other. Follow the bride- and groom-to-be on Instagram, and you'll notice there's no dearth of kisses and hugs in their world.

If you’re one of the millions of people following @sussexroyal, you could be interacting with The Duchess of Sussex directly 
Much has been written about Meghan Markle's former life as a Suits actress, humanitarian activist and of course, the woman behind the lifestyle blog The Tig. This had afforded Markle (now The Duchess of Sussex) a certain level of celebrity and she had even amassed three million Instagram followers on her own account where she shared recipes, mantras, outfit details and intimate moments with friends. In January of 2018 she closed down her account in order to move to London, marry Prince Harry and start her life as a royal. At the time, Kensington Palace released a statement saying the future Duchess was “grateful to everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years.” It seemed to herald the conclusion of Markle's Instagram tenure, but now we have to question if it really was the end. Rumour has it The Duchess of Sussex is personally running the newly minted Instagram account for her and Prince Harry—@sussexroyal—and here's why. 
If you have Instagram, it is impossible you've escaped the news the Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently started their own joint Instagram account. Announced on April 3, the launch was part of a pre-planned split of the Kensington Palace household, with the Cambridges and the Sussexes now considered separate in terms of their house, office, communications and staffing. The Duke and Duchess broke apart from the @kensingtonroyal account, opening @sussexroyal where they shared this statement: “Welcome to our official Instagram; we look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements, and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues. We thank you for your support, and welcome you to @sussexroyal.”- Harry & Meghan.” 
Since opening the account, they have done exactly that, sharing information about their work, including with the charities and organisations they are patrons for and also using it to announce major news, like the Duke's collaboration with Oprah Winfrey on a new health series for Apple. (We are expecting them to also announce the birth of their baby on this platform). 
But as the posts grow and the impeccable styling of the Instagram grid continues (hello photo borders, one of Markle's previous Instagram tropes), it is becoming clear that the duchess is certainly very much involved in the account, even leaving some to wonder whether she is personally running it. 
For one, the Instagram captions are incredibly lengthy and also intimate—it definitely has the personal touch which the Duchess has brought to the royal family. In a post about what has been dubbed the #globalsussexbabyshower—a grassroots initiative encouraging the public to donate to key charities the couple support in lieu of baby gifts—the caption called the movement a “special surprise” and even used an emoji. 
Then there's the American slant. In a recent post, Their Royal Highnesses pointed out the impact the #globalsussexbabyshower had on these key charities, in which the caption noting the movement had “re-energized their hard working team of 200+ staff and volunteers.” Note the American spelling of re-energised—was this personally written by the Californian-born Duchess? Later, the caption uses the word “diapers”, an American term for what the British would call nappies. There's also dollar signs aplenty and although these are offset with British pound signs, it totally feels like the Duchess is very much behind the messaging of the account. It's likely she isn't managing the account—she has social media staff to do so and that involves vetting comments, controlling the royal social media guidelines and so on. However, we wouldn't be surprised if Markle was personally penning the captions and even pressing post—after all, we know she is more than capable of doing so. 
The palace is likely to never comment on the issue but we are building our case and wishing for posts about homemade banana bread recipes and how to source the perfect Tignanello wine. Until then, we'll leave you with Markle's famous social media mantra—#NoBadEnergy.

From Alia Bhatt’s intense Kathak preparations to Shraddha Kapoor’s street dance sessions, these stars are leaving no stone unturned in their training 
Given the potential of a single dance sequence to seal a movie's place in YouTube's hall of fame even before the release of the actual movie, it should come as little surprise that actors are going the extra mile to perfect their routines. Further proof to this can be found in a quick scroll through the paparazzi's regular Instagram logs, with stars being spotted outside dance classes more often than the gym. And with good reason too—Alia Bhatt's striking poses in Kalank's 'Ghar More Pardesiya' involved strenuous training every single day for a year, while young debutante Ananya Panday started a rigorous dance regimen before signing her first movie to keep up with industry standards. Here, we round up the dance forms and local training academies that are on celebrity radar. 
Bhatt's masterful performance in 'Ghar More Pardesiya' in her upcoming movie, Kalank, can be credited to her exhaustive training over the course of one year. The fruits of her labour are visible in the music video that has crossed 38 million views since its release on YouTube. Bhatt further elaborates, “I learnt Kathak for around a year. I would have lessons every day before we shot the song. Then, I danced to the choreography and practised it for about two and a half months. Just two days before we were filming 'Ghar More Pardesiya', I went to Pandit Birju Maharajji, who helped me learn the expressions I needed to lip sync to the track. His guidance helped me a lot.” 
The young star made her grand Bollywood debut in 2018 with one of the most talked about dance numbers of the year, 'Zingaat'. Since then, the 22-year-old has kept the momentum going with regular dance classes at House of Wow, Bandra, taking prominence in her weekly schedule—her younger sister Khushi Kapoor even revealed that the actor randomly starts dancing when idle in an upcoming episode of BFFs with Vogue. Having signed Karan Johar's action drama, Takht, as her second project, Kapoor has been diligently practising her dance sequences for the same. 
The freshly-minted debutante already has two successful movies on her portfolio, and about twice as many chartbusters to her credit. And while she admits that the dance routines for Kedarnath came easy given her skills as a trained Odissi dancer, the robotic dance moves for 'Aankh Maare' apparently threw quite the curveball. The solution came in the form of comprehensive dance training at a studio in Andheri, Mumbai. The 23-year-old has continued with a brisk training schedule alongside the shoot of her next feature, Love Aaj Kal 2 opposite Karthik Aaryan, and recently set the internet ablaze with a throwback video of her performance on 'Saat Samundar Paar' for a wedding. 
Panday is said to have started a heavy roster of acting and dance classes since 2017 to prep for her big Bollywood debut in Karan Johar's Student of the Year 2. Under veteran choreographer Saroj Khan's tutelage, she has been mastering the requisite Indian dance forms that constitute an archetypal Bollywood movie, and even shared the stage with Will Smith for one of the dance sequences from the movie. 
Having proved her mettle with several dance-centric movies in the recent past, Kapoor is now challenging herself to learn five different dance forms for her upcoming feature opposite Varun Dhawan, Street Dancer 3. The 32-year-old can regularly be spotted at a dance academy in Andheri, Mumbai, where she is attempting to master multiple dance forms—afro, krumping, locking and popping, animation tutting and urban—for a major dance-off sequence to be shot on the streets of London.

She loves her Indian desserts, can't stop painting her nails and has an ear for some of Bollywood's oldest romantic numbers. Get to know the real Sara Ali Khan with her biggest confessions 
With Kedarnath and Simmba, Sara Ali Khan has made her way to the list of Bollywood's most-followed newcomers. But while we all know about her style and her silver screen skills, there's much more to this debutante than meets the eye. Our April 2019 cover star doesn't just love bingeing on Indian sweets, she's also got a playlist full of unexpected old-school tracks and an obsession with nail paint. Ready to discover the real Sara Ali Khan? 
I'm a huge pizza fan, and I have the biggest sweet tooth ever. I love milk cake and besan ke laddoo. 
I am a die-hard Sridevi fan. The fact that the main role in Chandni (1989) and Reshmi in Sadma (1983) are played by the same actor is shocking to me even today. 
I really don't know what I would do without my mother. I think my biggest fear is to not have immediate, prompt access to her. 
I don't have a temper, if you really upset me or piss me off, I will cry. 
It depends. 'Lag Jaa Gale' is definitely one of my favourites, so are 'Bahon Mein Chale Aao' and 'Tune O Rangile Kaise Jadu Kia'. My playlist goes from 'Om Namaha Shivay' to 'Allah Hu' to 'Mere Mehboob Kayamat Hogi' to 'Coca Cola Tu', and there is no part of me that will be able to tell you if I like 'Lag Jaa Gale' more or 'Coca Cola Tu'. I can't help it, they both speak to my soul. But it's best to avoid playing 'Aankh Marey' in front of me, because suddenly I'm a lot more open and a lot more fun than people are down for. And I'm like, "You played this song, you change it. You asked for it." 
I think a little too much. They say do what your heart tells you. Now that's a bit of a problem if you've met me because my heart tells me really funny things and sometimes my heart and brain don't really coincide. 
I love New York but after graduating from Columbia University, I started traveling within our country a lot. I think right now I would like to travel to more parts of our country. I have never seen the North East, I want to go to Ladakh, Orissa, Kolkata… I saw the Taj Mahal last year. 
My first memory of going to a place where people do this thing called 'shooting' was probably either the sets of Omkara (2006) or Kalyug (2005). It may even have been Preity Zinta's van or my mom's hairdresser's room somewhere. 
A period film with Mr [Sanjay Leela] Bhansali… Let's get greedy and say an author-backed film with Mr Bhansali. 
Crying. 
I am obsessed with nail paint. I have changed it in every shot of the songs in Kedarnath. I was heartbroken on the day of my Vogue shoot when the team told me, "These are your nails for the day". I was like, "Are you joking?"

If you love Indian weddings, this news is going to make your day. Priyanka Chopra and Mindy Kaling are going to be working with Dan Goor on a movie, a comedy based on Indian weddings 
Priyanka Chopra is having a good year. Three months after announcing her plans to produce a film on controversial cult leader Osho's personal secretary, Ma Anand Sheela, Chopra has just confirmed that she will be teaming up with Mindy Kaling and Dan Goor for a film based on the typical Indian wedding. The announcement comes on the heels of Universal Studio winning the rights to develop the untitled comedy film pitched by the trio. 
As per reports, Kaling will star alongside Chopra in the film, and will potentially direct it too. She will also be writing the screenplay with Goor, who is the co-creator and executive producer of American sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine. The movie will be co-produced by Goor, Kaling International, Chopra's Purple Pebble Pictures, and 3Arts' Howard Klein. 
While the exact details about the film haven't been revealed yet, reports say the wedding film's plot "revolves around a big wedding in India and the ensuing culture clashes." Think Crazy Rich Asians meets My Big Fat Greek Wedding, except set between America and India. If you've got a thing for rom-coms, or just loved tracking Priyanka Chopra's own wedding with Nick Jonas last year, a movie like this will be right up your alley. 
Celebrating the exciting moment, Chopra took to her Instagram account to share a series of posts with her fans. In the first one, she wrote, "Two women with a passion for telling good stories, just got the green light to THEIR story THEIR way. So proud of this incredible partnership with @mindykaling and @djgoor! We are about to show you what it means to be modern, global, and Indian. See you at the cinema!" 
In the second post, she shared a picture with Kaling and Goor and captioned it as "#PROUD @mindykaling @djgoor." The post has already received lots of love and support from fans who can't wait to see the movie. On the Bollywood front, Chopra will soon be seen in Shonali Bose's The Sky Is Pink, which also features Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim in significant roles. The film, based on motivational speaker Aisha Chaudhary, is scheduled to release on October 11, 2019.

Tiger Shroff, Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday are unmissable in the very first look of Student of the Year 2. Catch up on the trailer now! 
Back in 2012, Karan Johar's Dharma Production gave India's young adults a teenage romance film to fall in love with: Student of the Year. The film didn't just mark Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra's first steps into Bollywood, it also quickly reached cult status, inspiring back-to-school looks, prom outfits and much more. If, you like so many others, count SOTY as one of your weekend guilty pleasures, this is going to make your day. After months of sharing sneak peeks of Student of the Year 2, the film's cast and crew came together today to finally release its trailer, and it's more action-packed than you could have imagined. 
Starring Tiger Shroff in the lead role along with debutantes Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria, Student of the Year 2 seems to follow a similar story line as its prequel. The three minute trailer theatrically introduces each character and strongly hints at a love triangle, along with lots of power struggles, and of course, snippets from Saint Teresa's much-talked-about sports contest. While Shroff plays the role of the ever-determined Rohan, Panday portrays a no-nonsense character named Shreya and Sutaria will be seen as the glamorous Mia. In true Dharma fashion, the trailer promises Johar's trademark touch: think perfectly put-together sets that will make you wish you were part of this academy, eye-catching ensembles that perfectly complement each character's personality, and a playlist full of catchy tunes. Spoiler: you'll also get to see Will Smith make a cameo appearance in the film, and rumour has it that Bhatt, Dhawan and Malhotra will be making special appearances in the movie as well. 
Earlier today, Karan Johar also took to his Instagram page to share a brand new poster of Tiger Shroff, Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria, saying,"Make way for the #BatchOf2019, here they come!!" 
If you haven't checked out the trailer yet, it's time to catch up. Student of the Year 2 releases on May 10.

“Take your rightful seat in history, Dr Bouman,” New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter 
If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has anything to do with it, everyone will know of the woman who captured the first photo of a black hole: Katie Bouman. Bouman, a 29-year-old computer scientist, made history on April 10 as the image was circulated for the first time. 
AOC wasted no time in congratulating the scientist: “Take your rightful seat in history, Dr. Bouman!,” she wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations and thank you for your enormous contribution to the advancements of science and mankind. Here's to #WomenInSTEM!,” which stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
As a graduate student Dr Bouman helped to lead the development of a computer programme that made the breakthrough image possible. She started making the algorithm three years ago while she was still studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
“Watching in disbelief as the first image I ever made of a black hole was in the process of being reconstructed,” she wrote in the caption to the Facebook post. The image of the black hole shows a halo of dust and gas 500 million trillion kilometres from planet earth. 
Captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)—a combination of eight telescopes—was made possible thanks to Dr Bouman's algorithm. Now an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology, she insists it was a team effort of 200 scientists to capture the image of the black hole. “No one of us could've done it alone,” she told CNN. “It came together because of lots of different people from many different backgrounds. We're a melting pot of astronomers, physicists, mathematicians and engineers, and that's what it took to achieve something once thought impossible.”

Elle Woods is a real person and her name is Kim Kardashian West 
38-year-old beauty entrepreneur, reality TV star, social media queen, mother-of-three (soon to be four) and wife of Kanye West is nothing if not full of surprises. Almost every move she makes and has made since she first rose to public prominence has been unexpected. 
Case in point: who saw her meeting with President Trump to discuss the release of Alice Marie Johnson from prison coming? No one. What's more surprising is that she's on a reality TV show, so fans feel like they're privy to so much of her life, when does she have time to be working on other secret projects? 
In the latest episode of Keeping Up with Kim Kardashian West we've learnt that the 38-year-old is basically the real life Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. In her cover interview with US Vogue, the reality star revealed that she's studying law. And like anything Kardashian West does, she's not doing it half-heartedly, she's all in and working towards taking the notoriously tough bar exam in 2022. 
This revelation has brought up so many questions, not the least of which is how is she studying law without the requisite undergraduate college degree to get into graduate law school? According to US Vogue, in four states, including California, there is another way into law school: an apprenticeship with a lawyer or a judge. This is the path Kardashian West is taking and has, per the interview, two “mentor” lawyers, Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney, who she studies with every week for the required 18 hours of “supervised study”. 
This is her first year of studying law, but seems to be a natural at criminal law in particular: “...crim law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me… The concepts I grasp in two seconds,” Kardashian West shared with US Vogue. 
On the one hand, Kardashian West studying to be a lawyer actually makes sense. The reality star's dad, the late Robert Kardashian, was a lawyer and famously represented OJ Simpson during his 1995 murder trial; there's a legal legacy there. 
But on the other hand, she's already exceptionally busy between running her beauty empire, looking after her soon-to-be expanding family—Kardashian West and Kanye West are expecting their fourth baby by surrogate sometime in May—and appearing on her family's reality TV show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. How will she find the time to also become a lawyer? 
“I had to think long and hard about this,” Kardashian West told US Vogue of her decision to study law, but she says that after the “really good result” with Alice Marie Johnson, she felt like she could do more if she knew more. “I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society. I just felt like the [legal] system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more.” 
After this latest move, would anyone be surprised if Kim Kardashian West ran for president one day?

Showing off her impeccable dancing skills, Madhuri Dixit Nene is unmissable in 'Tabaah Ho Gaye', the latest song released from Kalank's soundtrack 
Of all the films releasing this April, Kalank may be the most talked about among Bollywood fans. With its extensive cast, larger-than-life sets, regal costumes and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, this romantic saga is bound to be an interesting watch, and every new detail about the movie that hits the internet takes social media by storm. 
If you've been following Kalank's promotions, you've already heard some of its songs, namely 'Ghar More Pardesiya', 'First Class', and the film's title track. Today, the Kalank team released one more number from the movie, titled 'Tabaah Ho Gaye'. While the video of 'Ghar More Pardesiya' had Roop (played by Alia Bhatt) showcasing her Kathak skills, 'Tabaah Ho Gaye' spotlights the character Bahaar Begum, played by Madhuri Dixit Nene. Dressed in a vibrant orange anarkali, Bahaar Begum takes the dance floor surrounded by dramatic, oversized chandeliers (you may remember this set from 'Ghar More Pardesiya'), and there's no missing the precision in her every move or the expressions on her face. Many fans are also drawing parallels between 'Tabaah Ho Gaye', which tells the story of a lost love, and Madhuri Dixit Nene's heartfelt dance performance in 'Maar Dala' from Devdas (2002). It's safe to say that this Bollywood icon's dance skills are just as on-point today as they were 17 years ago. 
The highlight of the two minute video is, of course, the solo performance the actor gracefully executes towards the end of the song. Can't believe the ease with which she pulls it off? You'll want to rewind and watch this picturesque song again and again. 
Prior to the release of the song, director Karan Johar also took to his Instagram account to talk about 'Tabaah Ho Gaye', and also shared a very special message with the sneak peek. "Kalank will be special to me for various reasons but one of the most special reasons was that it was our first major collaboration with Madhuri," he said. 
Starring Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapur, Madhuri Dixit Nene and Sanjay Dutt, Kalank is all set to hit theatres on April 17. In case you missed the film's impactful trailer, click here.

Every year, Barkha Dutt creates and curates an interactive festival called We The Women for Facebook and UN Women, in an aim to provide a platform for such women and acknowledge their achievements. Well into the third instalment, the latest edition was held in Bhopal, addressing issues faced by women in various fields spanning across cinema, politics, sports, literature and law. 
The festival provided a free space for everyone to meet and interact with extraordinary female minds from across India, and also hear from the men who stood up for women and feminist principles. Among the many topics discussed here, the most important included the unforgettable moments in history like the Bhopal Gas Tragedy of 1984 (which is considered to be the world's worst industrial disaster), and the underrepresentation of women as judges and politicians. Barkha Dutt also spoke to Captain Shalini Singh about her journey from army widow to joining the Indian army herself. 
Taapsee Pannu also supported Dutt by sitting down for a conversation with The Revolver Daadis, to discuss the age-old topic of misogyny and how the Dadis are breaking the norm.

Kim Kardashian West's latest picture puts her among the ranks of Victoria Beckham, Selena Gomez and others who have sported Indian clothes and accessories in the past 
Remember when Selena Gomez wore a bindi in her 'Come & Get It' music video, or when Paris Hilton picked a hot pink sari during her visit to India, or when Julia Roberts sported a silk sari in Eat, Pray, Love? Indian accessories and garments have had a long history of finding themselves in the wardrobes of Hollywood A-listers, and recently, Kim Kardashian West added another one to the list when she stepped out in a gold maang tikka for husband Kanye West's weekly Sunday Service. She paired the piece with a white, off-shouldered dress and shared the outfit on Instagram with the caption, 'Sunday Service Vibe.'

The royal couple’s new social media account reached one million followers in less than six hours, confirmed Guinness World Records 
Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex launched their new Instagram account on April 2, people have fully welcomed the new insight into the couple's life. So much so that the couple have now officially broken a world record, having amassed more than one million followers in less than six hours on @sussexroyal. 
The account, which now has 3.3 million followers, will be used for a variety of reasons: “We look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues,” the couple said in their first post, featuring the pair's royal cypher—the entwined initials H and M below a coronet—in white. 
Guinness World Records confirmed the feat by taking to Twitter to share the achievement: “Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, whose new Instagram account sussexroyal reached one million followers in less than six hours.” 
The previous record was held by South Korean K-pop singer Kan Daniel, who achieved one million followers in 11 hours, 36 minutes. Before him, the record was held by Pope Francis, who hit the million mark in 12 hours after launching @franciscus in 2016. 
The couple has already shared a second post—a gallery of photographs of Harry taking part in a ballet class in West London since launching the account. 
The move sees the couple step away from the @kensingtonroyal Instagram account—which was previously used by the Cambridges and Sussexes—and will now represent William and Kate, and currently has 7.2 million followers. 
In recent weeks, several changes have been made to the traditional royal set-up. First of all, the Queen joined Instagram at the start of March. The royal family also published new social media guidelines for the public after Kate and Meghan experienced continuous trolling. Harry and Meghan will also set up a new residence at Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle in the coming days as the couple await the arrival of their first child. The separation of the households was confirmed by the Queen and is a first for the royal family.

When I identified the need for these positions in my team, it was only logical to look at Bumble Bizz to begin the search for the right candidate. I'm eager to see how this plays out and I'm looking forward to making new connections through this initiative.” 
Interested candidates in India and the US can match their profiles with Chopra's through Bumble Bizz. The actor's team will reach out to the shortlisted candidates over the next few weeks, before selecting the final names.

Teigen recently posted a picture on Instagram showing off the celebrity couple’s new ink 
The couple that inks together, stays together? Seems to be the truth today for power duo Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, who showed off matching tattoos in a tribute to their adorable family of four. 
The husband and wife team decided on a delicately scripted trio of names: For Legend, “Chrissy-Luna-Miles” was artfully penned on his upper arm, and for Teigen, “John-Luna-Miles” on her forearm. The artist behind the ink? Los Angeles-based Daniel Winter, whose fine-lined creations can be seen gracing the limbs of A-listers from Sophie Turner to Miley Cyrus. He was the one behind Lady Gaga's Edith Piaf-inspired tattoo ahead of the Oscars. The pro sets himself apart with a single-needle fine-line technique that allows for minimalist drawings of stars, palm trees, flowers sayings, and chain links that mimic a new bracelet. 
While Legend opted for just the set of names, Teigen added on a small heart on the inside of her index finger—a loving touch indeed.

Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner recently spoke about her time at Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' wedding, revealing the one Bollywood dance move she still remembers 
Just when we thought summer had finally set in, winter came back in on Wednesday evening with the world premiere of the last season of HBO's Game of Thrones. While promoting the show in New York recently, actor Sophie Turner revealed some interesting details from her experience at Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas's lavish wedding in December in 2018. If you, like thousands of others, followed #Nickyanka's wedding closely, you won't want to miss this. 
During the interview, Turner admitted that her upcoming wedding with fiancé Joe Jonas will be very different from Priyanka and Nick's. As Turner comes from a family of doctors and lawyers, her relatives won't be indulging in any festive dance-offs, but that doesn't mean that Turner herself isn't a pro at some Bollywood moves. Watch the video and you'll see the actor, along with Maisie Williams dive into an impromptu jam to 2015 Bollywood movie's most popular track, 'Gallan Goodiyan'. 
  
One of the first times Sophie Turner and Priyanka Chopra were seen spending quality time together was at the latter's bachelorette party in Amsterdam, and since then, the duo's bond seems to only have strengthened. Turner was seen having a blast at Chopra's Jodhpur wedding in a series of beautiful lehengas, and most recently, the J Sisters, as they like to call themselves, were also spotted soaking up some sun during a quick family getaway to Miami. Watch Turner show us her Bollywood moves below!

Karan Johar is the first director to join Bollywood actors Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma, Priyanka Chopra and Shahid Kapoor on the list of Indian celebrities to get their very own Madame Tussauds wax statue 
After the likes of Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra and Anushka Sharma, Bollywood director Karan Johar just celebrated the reveal of his wax statue, which is housed in Madame Tussauds, Singapore. The filmmaker was joined by mother Hiroo Johar and his team at the celebration. What makes Johar's wax avatar so special is the fact that it perfectly reflects his personality. Dressed in a statement-making velvet blazer printed with countless butterflies, the statue's pose is one every millennial will be able to identify with. Johar's replica stands smiling into his phone, taking a selfie. 
Building up to the reveal of Karan Johar's wax statue, the official Instagram page of Madame Tussauds Singapore shared the following teaser. 
Karan Johar too kept his fans in loop with this post on Twitter: 
In a recent interview, Johar said that the wax statue is a very special gift for his twins, Roohi and Yash Johar. "I feel like a childhood dream has been realised today as my statue will be a part of this prestigious museum. I am absolutely excited and honoured," the director said in an interview recently, before talking about his own childhood memories of visiting Madame Tussauds with his father at age eight.

Mayoori Kango, who was seen in a few Bollywood films in the ’90s, made her drastic career swap work for her 
Mayoori Kango's filmography features titles like Papa Kehte Hain, Betaabi, Hogi Pyaar Ki Jeet, Badal and Papa The Great. She also did a number of small screen shows like Kaahin Kissii Roz, Kittie Party, Kkusum and Kya Hadsaa Kya Haqeeqat. But if you're a '90s kid, you will most likely remember her as the girl from the song, "Ghar Se Nikalte Hi". 
In an industry where a few hundred movies get rolled out every year, Kango's marriage and move New York in the early 2000s meant that she was soon out of Bollywood fans' radars, but not many know that the actor chose to do films in her teenage years over getting enrolled in IIT Kanpur. According to reports, the actor pursued an MBA in marketing and finance from Zicklin School of Business - Baruch College in New York after moving to the city, moving on to work in digital media agencies. A quick look at her LinkedIn profile reveals a career graph that's spanned many well-known brands, including a stint as the chief digital officer at Zenith. 
In the latest update from the actor-turner-digital marketer, she has now joined the Google India Gurgaon office as the brand's industry head-agency business. From a doe-eyed girl-next-door in Bollywood to someone at the top rung of a large digital corporate, Kango's career trajectory has been quite an interesting one.

There’s a new way to follow the Duke and Duchess of Sussex 
Today, Kensington Palace announced the creation of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's very own Instagram account, SussexRoyal. 
“We look forward to sharing the work that drives us, the causes we support, important announcements, and the opportunity to shine a light on key issues. We thank you for your support, and welcome you to @sussexroyal,” the couple wrote on their first Instagram, which was a picture of their joint monogram followed by several photos chronicling their royal duties. 
Now, the account KensingtonRoyal—which previously served as the official account for the Cambridges and the Sussexes—will now only represent Prince William and Kate Middleton. 
The news comes after Queen Elizabeth agreed to create a new household for the newly married couple. “This long-planned move will ensure that permanent support arrangements for the Duke and Duchess's work are in place as they start their family and move to their official residence at Frogmore Cottage,” the royal family said in a statement. 
Before, William, Kate, Meghan, and Harry all operated under the same umbrella of Kensington Palace, sharing staff, social media accounts, and resources. 
Chatter about a household split started back in October, when U.K.'s The Times stated that Princes Harry and William were “[calling] it a day for their double act.” 
“They have become different people with different outlooks on life. Splitting the household is the obvious thing to do,” a source told the paper. 
And they have two different futures: William and Kate will one day become the king and queen consort of the United Kingdom, two rigid roles, whereas Harry and Meghan have more flexibility to define their place in the royal family. 
So what will Instagram look like for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? Well, let's look at their first post: It's a slideshow portraying a mix of posed and candid pictures. Yes, there's a standard royal shot of the couple greeting crowds, but there's also one of Prince Harry fist-pumping. And, noticeably, there are some without the royal couple at all, like one showing schoolgirls in Morocco. And the last photo? It's an artsy, black-and-white candid: the Sussexes stand on a balcony with their backs to the photographer, waving to fans below. 
Even while operating under KensingtonRoyal, the couple had a more laissez-faire social media style: during their royal tour of Fiji, Australia, Tonga, and New Zealand, Prince Harry did his own Instagram Story while flying in a helicopter. Later, he took what looked like an iPhone photo of Meghan standing amid trees in New Zealand, smiling and holding her baby bump. 
In the comments section of SussexRoyal, the official account for Instagram wrote, “We are so happy you are here.” And, considering that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle gained more than 250,000 followers in under an hour, it seems the world is, too.

After releasing 'Ghar More Pardesiya', 'First Class' and Kalank's title track, it's time for Bollywood fans to check out the official trailer of Kalank. Have you watched it yet? 
Karan Johar never does things halfway, and his latest venture, Kalank, stands as proof. Ever since the film's posters hit the internet, the buzz around the 1940's romantic saga has only grown stronger. After dropping the film's teaser and first three songs, 'Ghar More Pardesiya', 'First Class' and the film's title track, the Kalank team just released its official trailer, which gives Bollywood enthusiasts a chance to discover a little more about the film's plot, sets and characters. 
Starring Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapur, Madhuri Dixit Nene and Sanjay Dutt, Kalank promises to be a grand project, and its trailer serves as proof. Opening with a series of never-seen-before shots of the cast members, the trailer reveals some pretty big details about the movie's storyline, starting with Bhatt's first dialogue, "Mere gusse mein liye gaye ek faisle ne hum sab ki zindagi barbaad kar di" (my one anger-fuelled decision ruined all of our lives). As the trailer progresses, more hard-hitting dialogues unfold the plot of the film, which tells the story of Roop (played by Bhatt), who enters a loveless marriage with Dev (Roy Kapur) to scorn a past lover, Zafar (Dhawan). And that's not all. Watch carefully and you'll also spot some unexpected faces in the sneak peek. (along with Kiara Advani, Kriti Sanon makes a cameo appearance in a dance sequence, and Kunal Kemmu seems to play an important role in the movie as well). 
Building up to today's trailer release, the film's cast has been going all-out on social media with unseen posters and video clips from Kalank. Yesterday, Alia Bhatt shared the following sneak peek from the film on her Twitter page too. 
Kalank is all set to hit theatres on April 17, 2019, but if you can't wait for the film's release, scroll to check out the trailer of the film before anyone else.

Malaika Arora just returned from the Maldives with Arjun Kapoor. Here's a look at some of Arora's best holiday pictures 
It's been a while since rumours surrounding Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor's relationship started doing the rounds. Though the two actors have never gone on record to confirm their equation, the duo are often seen at parties and dinners together, and now, reports state that the two may also soon be tying the knot in a Christian ceremony which is said to take place on April 19, 2019. 
Amid all the rumours, Arora took a break recently to enjoy some time off in the Maldives, and has been filling up her Instagram feed with several FOMO-inducing vacation pictures. But if you thought Arora was holidaying alone, you may be wrong. Recently, the actor was seen exiting Mumbai airport with Arjun Kapoor in tow, which has led her fans to believe the couple were on vacation together in the Maldives. In case you missed it, Arora returned to Mumbai in a breezy striped coordinated set, while Kapoor was seen accompanying her in a slogan tee and jeans. 
If you haven't checked out Arora's Maldivian holiday snapshots, you may have missed the fact that Arjun Kapoor has also been actively commenting on her vacation pictures, though the actor refrained from sharing any pictures on his own Instagram feed. Here's one of Arora's most popular posts from the holiday. 
When asked about the photographer of these images by friend and Bollywood director Farah Khan Kunder, Arora dodged the question saying she'll answer Khan Kunder when she comes back and meets her. 
In the recent past, Arjun Kapoor was seen sharing a couch with sister Janhvi Kapoor on Season 6 of Koffee With Karan, where he admitted to being in a relationship and also revealed that he may now be open to getting married. The latest episode of the talk show also had Malaika Arora chatting with Karan Johar, and one of the most talked-about moments was when Arora was asked about Kapoor's performance on the show. Her answer: “I like Arjun Kapoor—this way or that way.” Scroll to see Arora's best holiday pictures.

Bollywood A-listers such as Radhika Apte, Vicky Kaushal and Diana Penty among others have come together to celebrate fashion at the 8th edition of the Hindustan Times India’s Most Stylish Awards. Here’s a look at all the guests who turned up on the red carpet 
After hosting seven editions of the Hindustan Times India's Most Stylish Awards, the 2019 award ceremony to recognise the country's best dressed personalities across Bollywood, music, sports, business and politics is back tonight. Being held at Mumbai's St Regis, the evening has commenced welcoming several note-worthy names. 
In keeping with the theme of the evening, Bollywood's best dressed stars went all-out for the occasion tonight, just as they have for past editions of the annual awards ceremony. Last year, Deepika Padukone was awarded India's Most Stylish female, who showed up in a six-yard-staple gifted to her by the sari patron Rekha. Shahid Kapoor bagged the same award under the male category, dressed in a monochrome checkered suit by Gaurav Gupta. Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan was conferred as the Superstar of Style, while Sonam Kapoor Ahuja was received the Global Style Icon award. 
Among the first guests to arrive was Raazi actor Vicky Kaushal, who was soon followed by Radhika Apte. The duo were a part of the ensemble cast of the much acclaimed anthology Netflix film Lust Stories, although in different segments. Kaushal and Apte are the hosts for the evening, and have been joined by actor Ayushmann Khurrana, who will also be performing tonight. Other stars spotted tonight include Shah Rukh Khan, Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna, Kiara Advani, Sonakshi Sinha and Dimple Kapadia. While many women have opted for vibrant hues (think rani pink, canary yellow and ultramarine blue), Gauri Khan, Anushka Sharma, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diana Penty, Preity Zinta and several others walked the black carpet tonight in ebony ensembles, proving that black will always be stylish.

Alia Bhatt, who is currently promoting her movie Kalank, talked about her mental health and battling anxiety recently. Here's what she had to say 
So far, 2019 has been a successful year for actor Alia Bhatt. Not only was her latest release Gully Boy a big success, the star also recently won a Filmfare award for Best Actress for her work in Raazi. Currently, Bhatt is busy promoting her upcoming film, Kalank. Between busy promotion outings, the star also recently opened up about anxiety, and her experience with it. "I haven't been depressed but I've had bouts of anxiety. It comes and goes," Bhatt revealed in an interview. "It's been happening quite a bit since the past five to six months. It's not like an anxiety attack but I just feel low. Thankfully, I'm aware of it because of my sister (Shaheen Bhatt). She's fought depression. I've read her book," the actor revealed. 
In case you missed it, Shaheen Bhatt's book about depression came out on World Mental Health Day in 2018. Titled 'I've Never Been (Un)Happier', the book inspired Alia to share a heartfelt post on her own Instagram page. 
Bhatt isn't the first Bollywood actor to shed light on mental health issues. In the past, Deepika Padukone too has spoken out about her experience with depression, and Anushka Sharma has opened up about anxiety as well. During the interview, Alia Bhatt also revealed that her close circle of friends are a source of constant support in her life. "No matter how bad it is, I just let myself feel it. Sometimes, I feel like crying for no reason. Then it passes. Initially, I'd be a little confused. I'd constantly give reasons that it's because of work or maybe I'm tired or haven't been able to meet anyone... The kind of personality I have, I become a little on the edge. I spoke to friends about it. I spoke to Ayan [Mukerji] about it, I spoke to my sister's friend Rohan [Joshi]. Everyone told me that you've got to realise that it will go away. What's important is to accept it and not say that you're fine. If you're not feeling fine, then you should just say you're not feeling fine." 
On the work front, Alia Bhatt's next project, Kalank, hits theatres on April 17. The actor will also soon be seen sharing screen space with beau Ranbir Kapoor in Brahmastra.

If I Could Tell You Just One Thing finally dropped on YouTube and is full of life lessons. See what Simone Biles, Awkwafina and Diane von Furstenberg shared with Priyanka Chopra 
YouTube launched Priyanka Chopra's highly anticipated special If I Could Tell You Just One Thing yesterday, and the video has already earned itself more than 700,000 views. The half-hour special which released on Chopra's official YouTube channel shows the global star spending time with three inspirational women as she asks them to share just one thing with her. In case you missed it, the three women are rapper-turned-actress Awkwafina, Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. 
Through the course of her YouTube special, Chopra gets the three women to reveal some life-changing truth bombs, and their advice to her is something every watcher should jot down too. The actor, who married Nick Jonas last year says, “I guess getting married really made me think about what a next chapter is... What I'm excited about is meeting all of these people I'm going to meet, and asking them, 'What would be the one thing you want to tell me?',” in the opening monologue. 
The special started with Simone Biles, who used the platform to speak about the importance of therapy today's generation. Biles also opened up about her experience with abuse. Being an athlete, the one piece of advice she gave the Isn't It Romantic star was to trust herself and do something that terrifies her every day. 
The second guest on the special, Awkwafina (who we most recently saw as the quirky Peik Lin Goh in Crazy Rich Asians) spoke about what it was like for her to be catapulted into the public eye and going through immense life changes quickly. The rapper-turned-actor highlighted the importance of staying grounded and being in touch with herself while going through different stages of life. During her conversation with Priyanka Chopra, Awkwafina also looked back at her childhood, revealing that she was raised by her grandmother, and talking about using humour as a form of defence mechanism. Her one piece of advice to Chopra was something her grandmother shared with her: “Life is a series of up and downs. When you're up the only way is down and when you're down the only way is up.” 
If I Could Tell You Just One Thing came to an end with Chopra's one-on-one with Diane von Furstenberg, the woman responsible for popularising the wrap dress. During her conversation, Furstenberg talked about how she believes every woman in the world is strong, and how she plans to use her voice to empower others. The designer even helped Chopra try on the very first wrap dress she designed back in 1974, showing the star how to correctly wear the dress. The one piece of advice the designer shared is one that will resonate with many: “ The most important relationship in life, is the one you have with yourself and it's important to prioritise that.” Haven't watched the full video yet?

Since December 2018, Bollywood's been all about larger-than-life weddings. After Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh said 'I do' in two picture-perfect ceremonies in Lake Como, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas made things official in Jodhpur and now, rumour has it that Arjun Kapoor and Malaika Arora may be all set to tie the knot too. Though the duo have not officially confirmed their relationship to the public, their numerous outings and dinner dates (along with those social media party posts with friends) over the past few months have got the world's attention. 
Given that Malaika Arora's father Anil Arora is Punjabi and mother Joyce Polycarp is Malayali Catholic, reports state that the actor-television host may be planning a Christian wedding with Kapoor, which is said to take place in April 19, 2019. According to reports, will most likely be attended by Deepika and Ranveer, along with Kareena Kapoor Khan, Karisma Kapoor and of course, Arjun Kapoor's many cousins. 
It comes as no surprise that Arora would prefer a white wedding. Back in 2009, her sister Amrita Arora Ladak too said 'I do' to husband Shakeel Ladak in a Christian ceremony. The couple is also reported to have bought an apartment together in Mumbai's upscale Lokhandwala area in Andheri, where they will settle in post their marriage. 
Recently, Arjun Kapoor was seen sharing a couch with sister Janhvi Kapoor on Season 6 of Koffee With Karan, where he admitted to being in a relationship and also revealed that he may now be open to getting married. The latest episode of the talk show also had Malaika Arora chatting with Karan Johar, and one of the most talked-about moments was when Arora was asked about Kapoor's performance on the show. Her answer: “I like Arjun Kapoor—this way or that way.” 
In case you missed it, Arora also opened up about her previous marriage and divorce with Arbaaz Khan on radio show 'What Women Want', where she was interviewed by none other than close friend Kareena Kapoor Khan. When asked about love after divorce, Arora's response was simple. "I think all women should jump back into it with equal gusto. Have fun, enjoy it. I think for the first time in your life, you'll also kind of discover a sense of freedom." 
On the work front, Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor have their hands full. While Arora was most recently seen playing judge on reality show India's Got Talent, Kapoor is awaiting the release of his next film, India's Most Wanted, and also prepping for Panipat by Ashutosh Gowariker.

Following his love for music, Ranveer Singh turns global entrepreneur with the launch of music label IncInk. Here’s everything you need to know about it 
Ranveer Singh has always been one to follow his heart. One of the most loved actors in Bollywood today, Singh has charmed his audiences year after year with his commendable on-screen performances and interesting character choices. Most recently, the star transformed himself once again for Gully Boy, a film that saw him play the role of a struggling rapper from Mumbai. Following his passion for music, Singh just made a major announcement on his social media pages today: he is now launching a music label named IncInk, and this venture makes him a global entrepreneur. 
What's the story behind IncInk? The Padmaavat actor has joined hands with close friend Navzar Eranee to launch the music record label, which will launch talented artists. Sharing its logo on his Instagram, Singh wrote, "Inclusive. Independent. This is the soul of #IncInk - my passion project.” 
Through his record label, Singh intends to help talented artists in the field of music reach a global level. Sharing more details about the project, he described IncInk as “my passion project. A manifestation of a certain vibe. #IncInk is an independent record label formed by artists for artists...to discover, nurture & promote exciting talents from across India. Presenting #KaamBhaari, #Spitfire and #SlowCheeta the different hoods of our country. Let's show these boys some love.” 
Since his announcement, #IncInk has become today's highest trending hashtag in Mumbai, and has received lots of love on social media from Singh's friends from the industry including Alia Bhatt, Shanoo Sharma, Siddhant Chaturvedi and Arjun Kapoor. One of the sweetest reactions Singh has earned so far, of course, comes from wife Deepika Padukone. Here's what she said. 
On the movie front, Ranveer Singh is currently working on Kabir Khan's sports drama '83. The movie is based on India's historic win against the West Indies at the 1983 world cup, in which the actor will be seen playing former Indian player Kapil Dev. Apart from this, he will also be seen in Karan Johar's next project, Takht. The period drama is set in the Mughal era and features Alia Bhatt, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Vicky Kaushal and Janhvi Kapoor in lead roles.

From Virat Kohli to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, these sportsmen are as cool on Instagram as they are on the cricket pitch. How many are you following so far? 
It's a well-known fact that cricket is not just a sport in India; it's a living, breathing emotion, and the tournament that brings together the finest names from local and international cricket on the same pitch is devoured with an unfettered hunger by the masses. Now in its twelfth season, the Indian Premier League (IPL) continues to exert its dominion over our collective psyche in the scorching months of summer with record-breaking highs on the field, even as the after-party continues with viral candid moments on Instagram. If you're looking for more of the latter, here are the names you're going to want to hit follow on right away. 
Numbers fail to do justice to Royal Challengers Bangalore captain, Virat Kohli's cult following on Instagram. While he is known for being a trailblazer on the field, his whopping 31 million fanbase looks to Instagram to get a peek into his secluded life with wife Anushka Sharma who has 24 million Instagram fans of her own. One couple selfie, or even a throwback photo from their secret wedding in Tuscany, is all it takes for the cricketer to break records on Instagram, before setting new ones. 
Despite being one of the most successful captains in the history of the sport, the Chennai Super Kings captain's Instagram page is surprisingly simple, and full of pictures you'll relate to if you're a parent like him. A typical day in Dhoni's life often has him documenting his daddy duties—whether it's blow-drying his daughter Ziva's hair or sharing the joys of besan laddoos with his family. 
This Royal Challengers Bangalore player left a trail of broken hearts in his wake when he announced his retirement from international cricket last year, but his legion of fans still has IPL to get their fill of his prolific batting. Dubbed Mr 360, his exceptional talent with the bat is underlined by his gentlemanly appreciation of the sport—and that genteel attitude continues on his Instagram feed, which sees him leading a charmed life with his wife and two children. Villiers' third child is to be named Taj after the iconic Indian monument. 
At 39 years old, this Kings XI Punjab whirlwind is living his best life, and the party continues on Instagram where he plays host to 2.2 million followers. Living up to his self-proclaimed moniker of ‘Universe Boss', Gayle's Insta feed is an extension of his outlandish personality, including his love for muscle cars. 
The star of Chennai Super Kings' victory in the 2018 IPL final, 37-year-old Watson seems to be getting better with time, like fine wine. In addition to those selfies that showcase his rugged Australian good looks, snapshots of Watson's gorgeous sports reporter wife, Lee Watson, and their adorable toddlers, make for one picture-perfect Instagram page. 
Having played the starring role in countless teenage crushes, this Chennai Super Kings all-rounder is known to make waves on the field, and off the pitch as well. Sir Jadeja, as he is fondly called online, leads the stylish pack of Indian cricketers with his dapper personal style and his discerning eye for on-trend hairstyles. 
As the captain of Mumbai Indians, Sharma commands a devoted army of over eight million followers on Instagram. Touted to be the next in line after Kohli, the 31-year-old IPL member takes to Instagram to share tidbits from his demanding fitness regimen—usually followed by some downtime with his family over long-distance video calls. 
His cricketing career has seen some record-breaking highs and lows, but the star player of Rajasthan Royals is back where he likes it best—in the thick of action. The 29-year-old Australian player marked his return to India for the twelfth edition of the IPL by donning a traditional turban, and was also spotted acing that pink uniform on the field. 
As one of Delhi Capitals' consistent top scorers, this 21-year-old hasn't just piqued the interest of national selectors, he's also a strong Insta star with close to 1.7 million followers. From a steady stream of endorsements to magazine editorials and of course, selfies with his CEO girlfriend Isha Negi, the former captain knows how to keep his fans entertained on social media. 
This Delhi Capitals member may mean business on the cricket pitch, but there's no denying his happy-go-lucky attitude when he's not hard at work on the IPL. When Shikhar Dhawan isn't loading up his Instagram feed with adorable videos of his son Zoravar, he's often giving his three million followers some major workout goals with his gym posts.

The space agency announced on March 25 that its plans had changed, “in part” due to a shortage of outerwear 
Earlier this month it was announced that the first all-female spacewalk would take place on March 29, 35 years after the first woman ever took part in one. Now, NASA has made changes to the team line-up on the trip due to the lack of spacesuits to fit the female astronauts. 
Astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain were due to spacewalk (make a trip out of the spacecraft) on a mission this week to replace batteries installed last summer at the International Space Station. The full walk has been estimated to take around seven hours. 
The space agency announced on March 25 that its plans had changed, “in part” due to a shortage of outerwear. “Koch had been scheduled to conduct this spacewalk with astronaut McClain, in what would have been the first all-female spacewalk,” the space agency said in a statement. “However, after consulting with McClain and Hague following the first spacewalk, mission managers decided to adjust the assignments, due in part to spacesuit availability on the station.” 
McClain took part in a spacewalk last week, becoming the 13th woman to do so. “McClain learned during her first spacewalk that a medium-size hard upper torso—essentially the shirt of the spacesuit—fits her best,” the agency said. “Because only one medium-size torso can be made ready by Friday, March 29, Koch will wear it.” 
Koch will be the 14th woman to take part in a spacewalk—with her male colleague Nick Hague. McClain is now “tentatively scheduled” to perform her next one on April 8. 
The first woman to complete a spacewalk was cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya in 1984. Up until now, spacewalk teams have either been all-male or male-female. In nearly 60 years of spaceflight, 213 spacewalks have been carried out to test new equipment, carry out repairs or science experiments. Interestingly, both McClain and Koch were part of the 2013 NASA class that was 50 per cent female.

Don’t look for any drama between Priyanka Chopra and Meghan Markle 
After the Duchess of Sussex missed Chopra's wedding in India and the actress later failed to attend the duchess' lavish New York City baby shower, some tabloid speculation started: Were these two famous friends. . .fighting? But on a recent episode of Watch What Happens Live, Chopra succinctly shut those rumors down. 
It was a caller from Philadelphia who posed the question. “Are the rumours true that you were upset that Meghan Markle skipped your wedding to Nick Jonas?” he asked. Chopra started to laugh while host Andy Cohen added: “They said you didn't go to her baby shower because you were pissed at her!” 
“Oh, my God,” she said. “No, it's not true.” Her tone was so definitive that Cohen only responded, “Yes, okay.” 
Tabloids employing a false “catfight” narrative between two women is, unfortunately, nothing new—especially in royal circles. Once upon a time, there was a rumour of a rift between Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson (which, decades later, Fergie is still contesting), and more recently, between Markle and Kate Middleton. It got so bad that Kensington Palace issued a rare denial after a report that the two had an “explosive row”: “This never happened,” a palace spokesperson reportedly said. 
So, Priyanka's response—concise, dismissive, and frankly, a little annoyed—was, yes, a reaction to the question at hand. But also likely a reaction against just another story that pits women against women. After all, aren't there a million plausible reasons as to why two successful, world-famous women may have not been able to make these events, especially when one is expecting her first child? 
But now, thanks to Andy Cohen, it seems that Chopra has put the rumor to rest.

Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have been hanging out with Sophie Turner and more in Miami. Did you miss the couple's latest holiday pictures? 
Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas love jet-setting around the globe. Post their Jodhpur wedding in 2019, the couple have been spotted everywhere from England to Switzerland, and their travel plans don't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Just weeks after being seen dancing together in the Jonas Brothers' brand new music video 'Sucker', the duo have now flown over to Miami with their closest family members and friends for some time off. Over the past 24 hours, snapshots of Chopra kicking off her summer with the Jonas crew have taken over Instagram feeds everywhere, and may just give you some vacay FOMO. The actor and her husband are currently travelling with Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas and his fiancée Sophie Turner, along with others. 
Some of the first pictures to surface from Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' Miami getaway show the actor giving Jonas a kiss in a selfie, and their PDA is too cute to miss out on. Did you see the caption she added to this sun kissed picture? 
Over the course of just one day, Chopra has made the most of her holiday by switching between a total of three summer-ready looks. There was no missing her in that burnt orange dress, dancing with Sophie Turner on her yacht to 'Sucker' and (surprise, Bollywood fans!) Simmba's 'Mera wala Dance'. 
Post that, the star was also seen basking in the sun in a bottle green bikini, and then took to the streets of Miami in a striped coordinated set in shades of baby pink, powder blue and yellow. The highlight of her day may have been when Chopra and Turner tried their hand at jet skiing. 
With all those outfit changes, many #Nickyanka fans can't help but wonder if the Jonas brothers were sailing through Miami for yet another shoot or music video. Until we get more details, check out all the pictures from Priyanka Chopra's Miami trip below.

Priyanka Chopra is seeking advice from three inspiring woman as she enters the new chapter of her life. Here's everything you need to know. 
Priyanka Chopra isn't just an actor. The global star is a woman of many talents and now, is adding one more project to her list. Chopra will soon be launching If I Could Tell You Just One Thing, a special YouTube series that will have her seeking advice from three inspiring women, namely designer Diane Von Furstenberg, actor Awkwafina and Olympic gymnast Simone Biles. In case you missed it, the trailer of the upcoming show hit YouTube on International Women's Day, which fell on March 8. 
Based on the bestselling book of the same name by Richard Reed, If I Could Tell You Just One Thing has been produced by award-winning production house Sundog Pictures along with Chopra, Johnny Webb, Rob Bagshaw, and Sally Freeman, among others. The show will follow the Quantico star on her journey to meet and interview the three women, and will have each woman share their personal stories and give Chopra an actionable piece of advice that could help her (and all her followers) in navigating their own lives. 
It was back in January that Priyanka Chopra first announced If I Could Tell You Just One Thing with her #10YearChallenge Instagram post, saying, "With this #10yearchallenge taking over the internet, it's got me thinking about the past ten years of my life, like probably all of you. So much has changed! Not just my hair or my clothes (or my husband!), but in how I see the world. How I understand myself. In these 10 years, with everything I've done, I realised that it's my curiosity in others that has led me to grow into who I am today. So I decided to feed my curiosity by starting a journey where I will meet some extraordinary people. I am a lifelong learner and I am always seeking inspiration. Help me navigate my way through this journey as I ask my peers, role models, and friends -- #JustOneThing. Watch my stories today☝️ to be a part of my new @youtube Originals Special, “If I Could Tell You Just One Thing." She even asked her followers on social media to help her “navigate” the show and suggest things she can ask her guests. 
And sharing the trailer on March 8 on her Instagram, she wrote, "There is so much we can learn from each other...I'm grateful to @dvf, @simonebiles and @awkwafina for joining me on my show and sharing so many amazing stories as you'll see on #JustOneThing - my new @youtube original special, releasing on 27th March, 2019." 
After venturing in the digital space with the show, Chopra will be soon also be seen in Sonali Bose's The Sky Is Pink along with Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim. If I Could Tell You Just One Thing will premiere exclusively on her YouTube channel on March 27.

All set to release in January 2020, 'Chappaak' tells the story of an acid attack survivor. Don't miss Deepika Padukone's look from the movie. 
From a yesteryear superstar in Om Shanti Om to a Rajput queen in Padmaavat and a party girl in Cocktail, Deepika Padukone has played several varied roles in her decade-long career, but her next may just be the most challenging role she's ever taken on. Releasing on January 10, 2020, Chhapaak will have Padukone transform into an acid attack survivor. Directed by Meghna Gulzar (who is also the name behind Raazi and Talvar), Chhapaak is inspired by the life story of Laxmi Agarwal, who survived an acid attack at the age of 15, which was carried out by a suitor and his friends after she declined to marry the former. Having survived the traumatic experience, Laxmi Agarwal founded an organisation called Stop Sale Acid and has also led campaigns against acid violence. In 2014, Agarwal was also presented with the 2014 International Women of Courage award by Michelle Obama. 
To mark the very first day of Chhapaak's shooting in Delhi, Deepika Padukone took to her Instagram account just minutes ago to share the film's first look. The poster shows Padukone's brand new avatar, an acid attack survivor named Malti smiling from behind a mirror. How does she look? Meghna Gulzar couldn't have put it better herself when she spoke about Malti at an event recently: "You won't be seeing Deepika, you know. You will be seeing a disfigured Deepika. There is an uncanny similarity between the survivor and Deepika." 
Padukone too spoke about taking on Chhapaak recently saying, "When I heard this story, I was deeply moved as it's not just one of violence but of strength and courage, hope and victory. It made such an impact on me, that personally and creatively, I needed to go beyond and so the decision to turn producer." A celebration of the undying human spirit, Chhapaak will be Padukone's first production under KA Productions.

Betting agencies have also predicted the sex of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first child 
Before taking a wild guess at what Prince Harry and Meghan Markle might name their new royal baby, which is rumoured to be due in mid-to-late April, it would be wise to take into consideration all the rules and traditions the Royal Family have set in place first. 
Royal traditions generally dictate that royal names nod to both relatives and British history by way of a family moniker, while also remaining relevant enough for modern day use. Recycled names are commonplace, particularly given that as each individual possesses multiple, there are only so many that remain free. 
However, while King Edward VIII had a total of seven names, in recent times, members of the royal family have taken to cutting them down to between three and four. As Prince William and Kate Middleton opted to give their children just three, it's highly likely Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will do the same. 
When Middleton was pregnant with Prince Louis, Carolyn Harris, a history professor from the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies and the author of Raising Royalty: 1,000 Years of Royal Parenting, confirmed that “the further down the line of succession, the more likely you are to have a more unique or untraditional name.” 
Therefore, it's also probable that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex may decide to veer away from tradition and opt for a far more modern name, given that their first born will be seventh in line of succession to the British throne. 
In terms of hinting at their possible pick, the pair have been mum on the topic, with Markle telling a royal fan in Australian that “we've been given a long list of names from everyone, we're going to sit down and have a look at them.” 
According to US Vogue, Diana and Arthur are trending with British betting agency Betfair. Similarly, those betting on Ladbrokes are going with Diana, Victoria, and Alice if it's a girl, while Albert, Phillip, and Arthur top the list of boy's names. 
Although Princess Charlotte's full name, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, already includes a nod to the late Princess of Wales, it's still highly likely Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will find a way to include a tribute to Diana in their newborn's name. 
As for the gender of the high-anticipated baby, bets are favouring a female.

From performances to adorable PDA between your favourite celebrity couples, these are the highlights from this year's Filmfare Awards 
It has been a busy awards season this March, as actors like Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Katrina Kaif, Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana, Vicky Kaushal and Sonam Kapoor Ahuja made it to their third show last night, when the best in Bollywood gathered for the 64th annual edition of the Filmfare Awards in Mumbai on Saturday, March 23. 
Attendees were treated to Shah Rukh Khan playing host, as well as powerful performances by Kriti Sanon, Janhvi Kapoor and Ranveer Singh, among others. Young stars like Sara Ali Khan, Ishaan Khatter and Janhvi Kapoor made their debuts at the awards, while Bollywood also celebrated its stalwarts in the same night. Vicky Kaushal performed a dance tribute for Amitabh Bachchan, and Hema Malini was given the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award. The late actress Sridevi was also posthumously conferred with a Lifetime Achievement Award, which was accepted by her husband Boney Kapoor and daughters Janhvi and Khushi. 
With so many of the best Bollywood stars together under one roof, it's no surprise that there were a couple of unmissable moments from the big night. Here are some of our favourite ones. 
The foursome had a successful night at the show, plus they got to catch up with each other. The two men embraced when they saw each other, while Deepika, Alia and Ranbir were seen chatting in the first row. Alia Bhatt's film Raazi won five black statuettes (including Best Film!) and she took home the Best Actress award as well. Ranbir Kapoor won the award for best actor for his role in Sanju, and the two were seen gazing into each others eyes on the stage as they collected their trophies. Deepika Padukone presented her husband with the critic's choice Best Actor award, and the couple had a sweet moment on stage. Ranveer Singh got down on one knee as his wife gave him a kiss on the cheek. 
The two actresses were a part of major releases this year, and they were a big part of the show. Sara Ali Khan, who attended the show with her mom, took home the debut actor trophy. As she walked the red carpet, Janhvi Kapoor shared her excitement about performing in front of the best in the fraternity, especially now that she had seen the stage and decorations. She then wowed the audience with a dance medley. 
From Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's statement-making fuchsia pink Ralph and Russo gown to Alia Bhatt's black strapless gown by the same designer, everyone brought their A-game to the red carpet. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Diana Penty joined Kapoor Ahuja with their fuchsia Monisha Jaising and Dolly J ensembles respectively, while Athiya Shetty chose a green and cream outfit by Bibhu Mohapatra. Deepika Padukone and Kajol kept it classic in all-black looks, while Katrina Kaif chose a pastel Falguni & Shane gown. The men kept things exciting as well, with Ranveer Singh wearing a printed Versace jacket and sunglasses, and Karan Johar in a bedazzled suit. Here's a look at the highlights from last evening.

As 10 lakh polling stations are set all over the country, we give you a step-by-step guide to help you exercise your most fundamental right 
April marks the execution of the world's largest democratic exercise, as the parliamentary elections bring the political aspirations of the country's finest to a decisive conclusion. While the Trump-Clinton saga ruled the world stage for the past few years, all eyes are now on India with the announcement of the 2019 Lok Sabha election dates. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi eyes a second term, staunch opposition is expected from the Indian National Congress. Given the far-reaching consequences of the results, it is time to speak through your ballot and make your voice heard. This year will see around 820 million eligible voters, and with around 15 million of them being first-time voters, questions are expected, but you needn't look far for answers. If you don't have a voter ID card yet, or aren't really sure what one is, scroll ahead for our guide to everything you need to know about voting in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections 2019. 
The universal adult franchise prescribed in the constitution grants the power of voting to any Indian who has completed 18 years of age in the polling year, including resident and non-resident citizens. However, being able to exercise your right to vote necessitates having your name registered in the electoral roll and a voter ID card. 
The election commission has provided multiple means of registering for a voter ID card and subsequent electoral roll, including online and offline methods that cater to the different needs and conveniences of the citizens. Depending on your preference, you can opt for one of the following methods to register for a valid voter ID card before the elections: 
Documents required: 
A passport-sized photograph. Any one form of age proof, including Aadhaar card, 10th or 12th marksheets, driving license or passport. Any one form of identity proof, including as Aadhaar card, electricity bill, water bill or passport. 
Method: 
Visit National Voters' Service Portal at Nvsp.in and click on ‘apply online for registration of new voter/due to shifting from AC. Fill in Form 6 with the required details and attach the photograph, age and identity proof, as instructed in English, Hindi or any other Indian language of choice. Once the form has been submitted, you will receive a reference number that can be used to track the application over the next 30 days. The form will be passed on to the concerned Booth Level Officer, and after the mandatory verification process is cleared, the voter ID card will be generated and delivered to your address. 
Documents required: 
A passport-sized photograph Copy of age/identity proof Copy of residence proof 
Method: 
Visit the nearest office of an Electoral Registration Officer, Assistant Electoral Registration Officer or Booth Level Officer, and request Form 6. Fill in two copies of Form 6 with the necessary details and relevant supporting documents, and hand over the same to the Booth Level Officer of your polling area or post the documents to the required Electoral Registration Officer. After relevant checking and a potential visit to verify the residential address, your voter ID card will be delivered to your address. 
Anyone with a valid Indian passport who fulfils the required criteria of 18 years of age can register for the electoral roll, even if they aren't currently residing in the country. Those who wish to apply as an overseas elector can download Form 6A from the National Voters' Service Portal online. After filling in the required details, the form can be submitted online with one passport-sized photograph, self-attested photocopies of the Indian passport and valid visa. Once the documents are received by the electoral officer, a Booth Level Officer will visit the home address specified for verification. 
In case there isn't a valid address available, the documents will be sent for further verification to the Indian Missions Abroad embassy in the current country of residence. Once the process is completed, the final decision will be delivered to the foreign address specified, and your name will appear under a separate category for overseas electors in the electoral roll. 
To confirm your presence in the electoral roll prior to the elections, log on to NVSP's website to search the national electoral roll using a few basic details. The portal also allows you to locate your nearest polling station, print your voter information slip and familiarise yourself with the Booth Level Officer for your constituency. In case of any erroneous information, existing voter information can be modified and updated by filling the Form 8 available on the website. 
Voting for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections 2019 is scheduled to be held across India in seven phases on April 11, April 18, April 23, April 29, May 6, May 12 and May 19, with the announcement of the final result slated for May 23. Presence of a valid voter ID card is necessary on the day of voting, and the same must be presented to the First Polling Officer at the venue. The names of individual voters are then confirmed in the Register of Voters by the Second Polling Officer, and a signed voter slip is generated. The electronic voting machine (EVM) is kept in a separate compartment of the polling station, allowing the voter privacy while casting vote for their preferred candidate. The process is confirmed by the inking of a small, indelible mark on the left forefinger.

The political leader is setting a prime example in leadership through her reaction to recent events, which includes placing stricter gun laws in New Zealand after the Christchurch attacks 
In February 2018, speaking on the show 60 Minutes, the Australian news anchor Charles Wooley announced, “I have met a lot of prime ministers in my time, but none so young, not too many so smart, and never one so attractive.” He was speaking about Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister who, then 37, was pregnant. As the nightmare interview unfolded on national television, Wooley went on to ask her partner, Clarke Gayford, to comment on the pregnancy, stating, “It's interesting how many people have been counting back to the conception... as it were.” Twitter erupted in outrage, though many thought the interview “flattering.” A year later, there was a BBC interview, where anchor Victoria Derbyshire asked Arden if she planned to propose marriage to her partner. There would have been several questions on policy that the political leader would rather be answering—Brexit, immigration, socialism for today—but even in this age, a juggling woman continues to be a source of wonder, youth and “attractiveness”—a cue to transgress into flippancy. 
Ardern has been in the news the past few weeks following the shootings at two churches in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, where 50 people lost their lives. Times of crises, especially in the world of politics, often spur a stream of rhetoric and populism. The ideal response calls for a measure of empathy and decisiveness, and this is where few have been able to find fault with her. 
The gunman was a white supremacist who left behind a manifesto detailing the motives of his attack. Meeting the families of victims and quelling the concerns of the nation's immigrant community, Ardern was quick to separate the shooter from the nation's larger ethos, announcing, “You may have chosen us, but we utterly reject and condemn you.” Notably, she refused to name the shooter in her statement to not ascribe to him fame or notoriety. Ardern also announced that within 10 days of the shooting, new gun laws would be announced. (Soon after the attack, the New Zealand cabinet made an in-principle decision to introduce new gun legislation.) 
Ardern's global fandom isn't just tied to recent events. Leader of the Labour party of New Zealand, Ardern is a social democrat, a supporter of gay rights, a feminist, and the owner of a Twitter account that reads “Won't tweet what I ate for breakfast—make no promises beyond that” (where she regularly takes #AskJacinda questions), Ardern is clearly setting the template for what we want our leaders to be.

Putting all rumours to rest, Sanjay Leela Bhansali just confirmed that he will be working with Priyanka Chopra in upcoming film Gangubai 
With her life and career exactly where she wants them, Priyanka Chopra is reigning supreme. It's been a great few months for the Bollywood star both personally and professionally, and now, Chopra is also all set to star in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's next movie, titled Gangubai. 
Known for his larger-than-life sets, gripping storylines, regal costumes and poetic dialogues, the filmmaker seems to have his hands full at the moment with not one, but two projects. News about Chopra and Bhansali coming together for Gangubai hits the internet just days after Alia Bhatt revealed that she will be starring alongside Salman Khan in another Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, Inshallah. During an interview recently, the director touched upon his plans for Gangubai saying, “I love the story, it's been with me for long and I'm keen to make the film. Priyanka and I are in talks.” If you're an avid Priyanka Chopra follower, you may remember that the star recently spoke about the movie on the latest season of Koffee With Karan as well. 
The last time Priyanka Chopra and Sanjay Leela Bhansali worked together, it was for Bajirao Mastani, where Chopra played the role of Kashibai and shared space with Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh. Currently, Chopra is working with Farhan Akhtar on The Sky Is Pink and will also soon be seen playing Ma Anand Sheela in a much-awaited biopic.

To mark her debut on US Vogue's April cover, Padukone appears in the iconic video series to tell us about favourite restaurant in NYC, the languages she can (and can't speak), her travel hacks and the thing she misses most in India when she's away. Joining fellow Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra, Padukone talks about the biggest similarities between Hollywood and Bollywood, her dream costar and the best film she's done so far. She dives deep as well, sharing her thoughts about depression, feminism and finding her personal mantra. Padukone even gets coaxed into busting a popular dance move (hint: flossing). Want to know what her most overused emoji is or what show she is currently binge-watching? You'll have to watch to find out.

Hosted by two of Bollywood's newest faces, Kartik Aaryan and Vicky Kaushal, the awards included some unmissable moments including Alia Bhatt's romantic on-stage dance with beau Ranbir Kapoor (the couple did a quick performance to one of the first romantic tracks of Bhatt's career, 'Ishq Wala Love')...

Meghan Markle’s New York baby shower may have been an extravagant affair, but it didn’t see her mother or her UK friends in attendance 
Like any milestone life event, whether it's getting married or having a baby, it's important to mark it with appropriate fanfare and make the most of the time by creating as many memories by way of multiple celebrations around the occasion as possible. 
Take a wedding, for instance, there's an engagement party, often a rehearsal dinner the evening before, the wedding ceremony itself, a reception and then a day-after recovery do. And it's similar for a new baby, there's the baby shower, then there's the day the baby arrives, then there's the christening. These life events really are kind of like festivals! 
Which is why the news that royal mum-to-be, 37-year-old Meghan Markle is planning a second baby shower seems totally fine. Normal even. Is anyone surprised? It's a life event that requires many celebrations and in the duchess's case celebrations in different countries. It is a royal baby after all who will be in seventh-in-line to the British throne when he or she arrives next month. 
Also, if there's one thing we know for sure about the actress-turned-duchess it's that she loves a get-together. She flew across the ocean to New York for a whirlwind few days in February this year, heavily pregnant, to have macarons with her friend and sometime stylist Jessica Mulroney, attend her baby shower thrown by her good friends Amal Clooney and Serena Williams and go out for dinner with her US-based gal pals. Talk about commitment. 
To be fair, the baby shower Clooney and Williams threw for the duchess did sound incredibly extra and like a once-in-a-lifetime event. As we reported earlier, Vanity Fair estimated the cost of the shower at around US$200,000 (AU$277,000) thanks to the the location (the penthouse suite at upscale five-star hotel, The Mark), the baby shower activities which included a flower arranging lesson, the snacks (a dessert table provided by the hotel's Michelin-starred chef), and a luxury piece of luggage from Away for each shower guest to take home. 
However, despite the extravaganza of that baby shower, the Duchess of Sussex's UK friends and her beloved mum, Doria Ragland, weren't in attendance, which clearly calls for a second baby shower. Which The Daily Mail reports is happening with a source telling the publication, “Doria [Ragland] is coming to a baby shower here [in the UK]. It will be a small gathering of five or six people.” 
Per The Daily Mail it is believed a “handful” of Markle's closest friends “including Victoria Beckham” and Meghan Markle's sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, are expected to be on the guest list for the second shower with Ragland to fly in from her home in Los Angeles. 
The second shower is rumoured to be a low-key event which The Daily Mail reports Markle originally wanted to hold at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor—where Markle and Prince Harry are planning to make their home—but with the house still undergoing renovations, the publication reports it could be held at Buckingham Palace instead. 
When more details of the second royal baby shower come to light, we'll update this story, so check back in.

Lilly Singh joins the likes of  Samantha Bee and Busy Phillipps with her latest win. Here’s everything you need to know about her new show. 
YouTube star Lilly Singh, also known as Superwoman, will now be the host of her very own late-night talk show titled A Little Late with Lilly Singh on NBC. The Indian-Canadian influencer made the announcement last night on the Tonight show with Jimmy Fallon, which also airs on NBC, and in true Superwoman fashion, shared the big news with all her 8.3 million Instagram followers with the happiest of snapshots and an equally cheery caption. 
Talking about the show, Singh told Fallon, “I truly get to create a show from scratch. I get to make it inclusive, I get to create comedy segments, interview people and really create something that I believe in. And I'm so honoured and humbled.” Singh even used the opportunity to take some advice from Jimmy Fallon on being a new host for the late-night talk show and was also welcomed to the NBC family by Seth Meyers, who hosts the The Late Night with Seth Meyers on the same network. 
With her new show, Lilly Singh will be replacing Last Call host and former MTV VJ Carson Daly, who will be stepping down after 17 seasons. Her show is set to launch in September and will be executively produced by Singh, making her the only female to currently host a late-night talk show on one of the four big networks. 
Singh first amassed a following via her YouTube channel IISuperwomanII, which she launched in 2010. She has since written How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life, and starred in films such as Bad Moms and Fahrenheit 451.

After Anushka Sharma and Shahid Kapoor, Deepika Padukone unveiled her wax statue at London’s Madame Tussauds with Ranveer Singh and her family 
Ever since her Bollywood debut in Om Shanti Om, Deepika Padukone has only grown as a star, and is considered to be one of the Indian film industry's finest actors today. Along with the many awards and honours she's collected on the way, the actor earned one more today: her very own wax statue at Madame Tussauds, London. 
It's no secret that Sabyasachi Mukherjee is one of Padukone's favourite designers. Not only does she frequently wear the couturier's creations, she even went on record to confess her love for Mukherjee's work back in 2016, during her visit to Madrid for the IIFA Awards. It tied in perfectly, then, that Padukone's brand new wax replica, which was unveiled today, is dressed in a stunning ivory Sabyasachi ensemble, which the actor wore to the very same awards ceremony three years ago. The champagne-hued lehenga has been topped off with a sheer floor-length cape and stunning emerald jewellery. While Padukone had styled this look in 2016 with intense smoky eyes and a low ponytail, her wax avatar wears the festive look with a classic wavy hairdo. 
For the reveal of her statue in London today, Deepika Padukone herself was seen in a pristine white caped pantsuit, paired with a low bun and diamond drop earrings. The star was accompanied by her parents Prakash Padukone and Ujjala Padukone, her in-laws Anju and Jagjit Singh Bhavnani and her husband Ranveer Singh. One of the cutest moments from the big moment was when Padukone looked at her mother and said, "Ma, if you miss me too much, you know where to come!" Ujjala Padukone responded with, "Now I know what would happen if I had twins."

The very first Kalank song to hit YouTube shows Alia Bhatt showcase her Kathak skills. Watch the complete video now 
Alia Bhatt is a silver screen chameleon, and her vast body of work serves as proof. While her debut film Student of the Year had her playing high school queen bee, Udta Punjab saw her transform into a migrant worker and most recently, Raazi showed her in a new light, that of a secret spy. In her latest project, Kalank, Bhatt fans will get to see the 26-year-old show a new side to herself as 'Roop', a character who is as elegant as she is fiesty. If you've been tracking all the new posters of Karan Johar's upcoming romantic saga, you may already know that the very first song from Kalank, 'Ghar More Pardesiya', has just been released on YouTube, and shows Bhatt doing something you've never seen her do before: showcasing her admirable Kathak skills. 
The colourful video of the song sees Bhatt walk into a celebration, where she joins co-star (and Kathak dancer) Madhuri Dixit Nene in a dance. As Dixit Nene sings, Bhatt takes the dance hall by storm with one perfectly-executed dance pose after another wearing an ivory, red and gold ensemble styled with regal gold jewellery and a loose braid. With that precision, you'd be surprised to know that Bhatt has only been training in the traditional dance form for about a year. 
A day before the song was released online, Bhatt took to her Instagram page to share a picture-perfect moment from the song, along with a note on how hard she's worked for Kalank. "I think you can safely say that I have never been SO nervous for anything in my life," the star revealed to her 29 million followers, but given the amount of love 'Ghar More Pardesiya' is already receiving, it's safe to say that Bhatt's efforts haven't gone to waste.

In a newly released statement, designer Masaba Gupta and producer Madhu Mantena confirm their decision to part ways, and ask for privacy 
Close to three years after their wedding, designer Masaba Gupta and film producer Madhu Mantena have decided to part ways, and have released an official statement to the public today. The couple tied the knot back in November 2015, and along with family, the celebrations had also been attended by some of Bollywood's biggest stars including Alia Bhatt, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut. 
"After much thought and consideration, we have come to an amicable conclusion on all matters," the statement reads. "We have decided to move forward separately and get divorced. We are two individuals who respect and care for each other and have made our own choices. We would appreciate if we are given our privacy in this time." Reports state that Masaba Gupta and Madhu Mantena have filed for divorce at the Bandra Family Court, Mumbai. 
This news comes after a seven month period of trial separation, which Gupta had spoken out about on social media in August 2018, saying, "With a lot of sadness, Madhu and I have today decided to go on a trial separation in our marriage. Both of us have taken this decision in consultation with professionals and our parents. The only thing we are ready to say for now is that 'What we both want of life individually and separately is putting unnecessary pressure on the marriage and love that we share. Hence, we would like to take some time off from our marriage to figure out for ourselves what we want out of this life. We are not strong enough to explain ourselves to even friends who deserve an answer from us.... All we can say to them is to give us time and to give us love when we reach out to you. We now need a lot of it :)" 
On the work front, Gupta will be launching her very first resort and swimwear line tomorrow, and has recently collaborated on a jewellery line with Amrapali.

In a new Instagram post featuring Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor, director Ayan Mukerji reveals a secret about Brahmastra that you need to know about. 
Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor have been on every Bollywood enthusiast's radar ever since they first stepped out together for Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's wedding reception, and the interest in the duo has only grown since. Soon, fans of the two actors will get to watch them join forces on the silver screen in Brahmastra, a fantasy film written and directed by Ayan Mukerji, and produced by Karan Johar. As we come closer to the film's release date, the Brahmastra family has begun sharing sneak peeks from the film in unique ways. While Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor recently came together to release the movie's logo, Mukerji has been sharing some unseen pictures from the film on his Instagram page too. His latest post is one you can't miss, as it may have just revealed new information on the plot of the film, as well as Bhatt and Kapoor's on-screen relationship. "Ranbir and Alia needed to work as one unit and that relationship was more important than their individual characters because at its heart, our movie is a love story. There has been a lot of love since then," Mukerji captioned this throwback picture from 2016, which shows a beaming Alia Bhatt smiling for the camera sitting between Ranbir Kapoor and himself. 
Over the past few days, Ayan Mukerji has also shared his cast's looks from the upcoming movie, which hits theatres this Christmas. Just days after Bhatt's Kalank poster took over the internet, the director, who also happens to be a close friend of Bhatt's posted this mysterious picture of the star saying, "I met Alia when she was 18 and almost instantly she bombed her way into my life and my movies and my soul. Today, she's not so little anymore and bombing us with too much beauty in Kalank's beautiful trailer which dropped earlier." 
Mukerji also shared some sneak peeks of Ranbir Kapoor from Brahmastra, where he revealed that the actor's character was initially named Rumi. 
Can't wait for more Brahmastra updates? Check out what Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor got up to in Uttar Pradesh at the film's logo launch earlier this month here.

After celebrating at Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's wedding, the Ambani family came together to host a musical fountain show for Indian jawans 
This week, all anyone could talk about was Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's wedding celebrations, which were attended by global leaders, top ranking members of the biggest companies in the world, sportspeople, and of course Bollywood's biggest stars. Post the wedding, the Ambani family organised a special musical fountain show for India's armed forces, police and their families on Tuesday, March 12. Thanking the forces for their unwavering service to the nation, Nita Ambani said at the event, "Each one of you and your families has the deepest gratitude and respect of all our 1.3 billion Indians. We thank you for accepting our invitation to participate in this very special programme at a very special place." She further added, “This is a proud moment for all of us to have our armed forces and their families with us today. With folded hands and from the bottom of my heart, I welcome the families of our jawans and officers. On behalf of Mukesh and myself, I seek your blessings and good wishes for our children Akash and Shloka. Your presence truly multiplies our happiness.” 
Ambani also reiterated the Reliance Foundation's commitment to take full responsibility of the education, employment and livelihood needs of martyred jawans' families. The philanthropic arm of Reliance Industries Limited is also in the process of establishing a skill development centre exclusively for the armed forces and their families. Ahead of the wedding, the Reliance Foundation head had also sent sweets to 50,000 Mumbai police personnel to share the family's happiness. 
The special event was held at the Dhirubhai Ambani Square at Jio World Centre in Bandra, which was inaugurated last week by Nita Ambani in the presence of 2,000 underprivileged children from NGOs supported by the Reliance Foundation, and was also where the Ambani and Mehta families kickstarted Akash and Shloka's wedding celebrations with an Anna Seva ceremony. The show presented vibrant water foutnain displays, along with a dance performance and an aerial dance act. The performance started with a rendition of Raas Leela of Lord Krishna, Radha and the Gopikas of Vrindavan, which was presented by over 150 artists from across the country. This act was followed by a musical fountain show on 'Vande Mataram', and closed with pictures of Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's journey from childhood to their wedding day. 
The highlight of the evening, of course, was the state-of-the-art water fountain, embedded with 600 LED lights, mist emitters, fire effects and 392 water nozzles that shoot water up to a height of a whopping 45 feet. The evening welcomed about 7,000 members from the security forces accompanied by their families as a mark of respect for them and to seek blessings for the wedding of Akash Ambani with Shloka Mehta.

Days after Alex Rodriguez announced his engagement to long-time girlfriend Jennifer Lopez with an Instagram post of her wearing his ring, the American star revealed what went on behind the scenes at the proposal 
On Saturday, Alex Rodriguez revealed that he and Jennifer Lopez are officially tying the knot. “She said yes,” he captioned the Instagram image of Lopez's hand along with that brand new emerald-cut sparkler. And today, the bride-to-be shared a series of intimate shots from the exact moment Rodriguez got down on one knee. The photos showed off both the dreamy private Bahamas beach location where the couple were vacationing, and Lopez's totally effortless—and not to mention aisle-ready—updo. 
While Lopez's name is practically synonymous with a variety of picture-perfect hair and makeup looks—including waist-grazing ponytails and many a fluttering fake lash—she has been known to sport more than a few slicked-back buns. Whether emerging from the gym or stepping onto the red carpet, the tight top knot (and pair of oversized hoop earrings, of course) has practically become her signature—and this recent look was no exception to that rule. 
Paired with a breezy white two-piece ensemble, the textured bun was likely the work of a few swift pins and an earlier dip in the Atlantic ocean. And although the power couple's wedding date isn't likely to be for a little while, here's to embracing a bridal beauty strategy that plays to your already honed strengths.

The reality TV star addressed her ‘psoriasis face’ with a no-makeup selfie video on Instagram 
Kim Kardashian West is experiencing her latest psoriasis flare-up, and shared evidence of the same on her Instagram story this week to highlight the common beauty ailment. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was first diagnosed with the inflammatory skin condition in 2011 during an episode of her reality show, and she has been vocal about her struggles ever since. She reportedly tried several different treatments to reduce flare-ups, including seaweed, detox smoothies, bathing in hot spring water from Iceland and even applying her sister Kourtney Kardashian's breast milk on her flaky, red patches. She wrote about the diagnosis on her eponymous (now defunct) app in 2016, saying “I wore this all-sequin dress and I started getting really itchy; I thought it was just a rash caused by the fabric, but then the rash was COVERING my legs and my mom was like, I think you have psoriasis!!!” 
[#image: /photos/5ce3f538b41afb2ce0a96cc5]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/kimkardashian 
Since her diagnosis in 2011, Kardashian West has tried to control her skin condition by experimenting with different techniques—however, since psoriasis is a chronic condition, it cannot be cured. It is due to an overactive immune system that causes cells to build up rapidly on the skin, which form scales and red patches that can be both itchy and painful. These patches can flare up in response to stress, cold weather and specific medications as well. While Kardashian West has attempted light therapy and a steroid ointment (that she spoke about on Instagram stories), she is still searching for the best treatment. She even reached out to her fans for help last December, asking them for suggestions and medication. 
She recently also responded to a tabloid that quoted her having a “bad skin day”, clarifying that the angry red blotches on her face were a result of a psoriaris flare-up. 
Over the years, Kardashian West has learnt how to use makeup to cover up the flaky patches with the help of her makeup artists. “I like a little bit of an oily slip for the foundation. You can see, I have psoriasis on my face. We gotta cover that,” she said in a beauty tutorial for Vogue.

More great news for Women's Month: An administrator from NASA said in an interview that the first person on the Red Planet will likely be a woman 
In a recent science and technology show, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said that the first person to land on the red planet is likely to be a woman. And he said that the next person to walk on the Moon will probably be a woman too. 
In case you didn't know already, NASA is all geared up to have its first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station on March 29. “These are great days,” said Bridenstine. “We have the first all-female spacewalk happening this month at the end of March, which is of course, National Women's Month.” Last week, NASA announced that astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain will go down in history as the first women to ever conduct a spacewalk outside the International Space Station. They will be joined by Mary Lawrence, who will lead the team as flight director, and Jackie Kagey, who will be the lead flight controller, confirmed NASA 
“NASA is committed to making sure that we have a broad and diverse set of talent,” added Bridenstine. The agency has clearly come a long way since inducting the first woman to the astronaut corps way back in 1978, with women comprising 34 per cent (more than 6,100) of NASA's astronaut task force today. The agency has big plans for its female astronauts for upcoming space missions, especially the next trip to the moon.

Watch the trailer in full here, and don’t forget to mark May 24 on your calendars 
After teasing a first look at the live-action remake of Aladdin during the Grammys, Disney just dropped the full trailer—and it's a veritable nostalgia bomb. There are the bustling markets and towering spires of Agrabah; the treasure-filled cave of wonders; an impossibly sassy Genie (Will Smith)—and more than a handful of smouldering glances between Aladdin (Mena Massoud) and Princess Jasmine, played by this month's cover star Naomi Scott. Best of all is the soundtrack, which includes classic songs such as ‘Friend Like Me' as well as Scott's rendition of ‘A Whole New World'. 
While the remake stays true to the original in many ways, Scott has breathed fresh life into the character of Princess Jasmine. “I saw her as a young woman, not a teenager, with a mature strength that can cut you down,” she tells Vogue for this month's issue. “So I said to them, ‘Just to let you know, I want to play her strong, and if that's not what you're looking for, that's OK, but it's not for me.'” Thankfully, she still has her beloved tiger Rajah by her side, in spite of earlier reports that the pet had been written out of the script. Watch the trailer in full below, and mark your calendars for May 24 now.

From the music to the scrumptious food, Rohini Iyer reveals all the details from the star-studded dinner she hosted at her Bandra residence. 
While most crave sleep after Indian weddings, Bollywood seems to enjoy unwinding in a different way. Last night, some of the Indian film industry's favourite faces came together for an intimate dinner get-together at Rohini Iyer's Bandra residence, and the pictures prove that the evening was an eventful one. 
Iyer isn't just the woman behind India's leading media management company, she's also a pro at preparing for impromptu celebrations. "I decided to host a small dinner at home because Priyanka [Chopra] was leaving town the next day. So, I just decided to call a few friends over and unwind. Some of them were coming straight from work, others were coming after attending the Ambani wedding party. All of us are insomniacs so it went on till dawn!” Iyer revealed to us. Chopra, who splits her days between New York and Mumbai, happened to be in the country to celebrate Akash Ambani's wedding with Shloka Mehta and joining her at Iyer's late night dinner were the likes of Janhvi Kapoor, Ishaan Khatter, Jacqueline Fernandez, Sushant Singh Rajput, Huma Qureshi, among others. 
But what's a get-together without the right food? “I know what everyone likes so I ordered accordingly. There was everything from truffle pizza, ravioli and avocado kebabs and it turned out amazing,” Iyer says. As for the playlist of the evening, Iyer opted for something quite unexpected. “I enjoy listening to old-world French music, and that's what was playing on my gramophone and everyone was making fun of me. Luckily Ishaan was there and he had some great music on his iPhone. So, he became the DJ for the dinner.” 
One of the most exciting pictures to surface from Iyer's residence is a star-studded groupfie featuring herself and her dinner guests huddled together on her terrace. One of the guests, writer Mushtaq Sheikh, was the first to share the snapshot on Instagram, which he captioned "the most super loaded Bollywood selfie of the season." 
And that's not all! Through the course of the evening, Rohini Iyer and her celebrity guests managed to capture a handful of unmissable party pictures. Missed them? Time to catch up.

It did break one thing for sure 
Commonwealth Day in the royal household was a big, significant day from both a sartorial perspective and the PDA between the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge. 
First, the outfits. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry kicked off their Commonwealth Day celebrations on Monday morning with a visit to Canada House to which eight-month pregnant Markle wore an embellished forest green coat from Canadian designer brand, Erdem. 
The green coat was a considered choice not just because it looked chic but also because it paid respect to where their official event was held: Canada House. The event at Canada House marked the first event for the Duchess of Sussex after it was announced on International Women's Day that she had been given the role of vice president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust—an organisation promoting young people in Commonwealth countries around the world. The Duke is the president of the organisation and this was their first event together in those roles so Markle's choice of a Canadian designer hit all the right sartorial and respectful marks. 
The next sartorial moment of the Commonwealth Day celebrations came by way of Kate Middleton at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with the rest of the royal family—Prince William, the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle—in a show-stopping red Catherine Walker coat with military-style button detailing, matching red hat and beige suede pumps. 
The significance of the coat, like Markle's Erdem wardrobe choice, arose not just from a style standpoint but also because of when she wore this coat previously. Middleton is a master royal wardrobe recycler and this is a prime example of pulling out a favourite at the perfect time. What Kate Wore reports the first time the 37-year-old duchess wore the Catherine Walker piece was when the Cambridges visited New Zealand in 2014 for an official royal trip. The coat has Commonwealth history. 
Markle also made a statement in her second outfit of the day, changing into a printed cream Victoria Beckham dress with matching cream coat and pillbox hat. She chose a British designer for a very British day. 
Fashion aside, the duchesses made 2019 Commonwealth Day also noteworthy because they broke, if not royal protocol, definitely one other thing when they greeted each other with a friendly kiss at the Commonwealth Day service: their rumoured feud. Rumours of a feud between the two royal wives had been circling around the tabloids for months but with that one friendly hello greeting those rumours were broken. Nothing to see here folks, just two friendly sisters-in-law saying hello in a totally normal way. 
Did that PDA also break royal protocol? We can't know without a deep dive into the official royal protocol books (surely there's such a thing?) but we do know that new fashion ground was broken by the duchesses at the service and any rumours of ill will were also definitively quashed.

Starring Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and many more, Karan Johar's next film is all about eternal love. Have you checked out the teaser of Kalank yet? 
Few do romance quite like Karan Johar. Over the years, the Bollywood director has made audiences laugh, cry and fall in love with his complex on-screen characters time and again with his work, and it looks he's all set to do it again with his latest, Kalank. Set in the 1940s, this romantic saga stars Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Sanjay Dutt, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Sonakshi Sinha and Aditya Roy Kapur, and the film's posters have already taken the internet by storm. What's got everyone's attention is each star's makeover for Kalank. While Bhatt looks every bit the royal as Roop in the film's first look, Dhawan's character Zafar is all about fiery aggression and Madhuri Dixit Nene's new avatar, Bahaar Begum, makes for a hauntingly beautiful poster. 
If you, like most Bollywood fans, have been waiting to find out more about Kalank, we've got some good news for you! Dharma Productions has finally dropped the very first teaser of the movie on YouTube, and it's everything you expected it to be. 
Bringing together picture-perfect sets, stunning costumes and hard-hitting dialogues that sound like poetry, Kalank's first look promises a plot line full of exciting twists and turns. While one scene shows a teary-eyed Bhatt performing a marriage ceremony with Aditya Roy Kapur, another shows the 25-year-old walking towards Varun Dhawan, who one may also think is her love interest in the film. Watch it once for its beauty and then again to absorb all the hints on what the story may be about.

During a recent interview, Hollywood actor Angelina Jolie shed light on the reason behind her break-up with ex-husband Brad Pitt. Here's what she had to say about the divorce 
It was back in September 2016 that new about one of Hollywood's most-talked-about couples, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, parting ways first surfaced. After more than a decade of togetherness, the couple's separation came as a shock for their fans all over the world. While Jolie maintained her silence on the matter, Pitt released a statement at the time of their divorce saying, “I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the well being of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time.” 
Since then, both Jolie and Pitt have spoken out about their divorce on separate occasions, shedding some light on the reasons behind their decision. In May 2017, Brad Pitt revealed details about his divorce and come July 2017, Angelina Jolie opened up for the first time about her life post the split when she featured on the cover of Vanity Fair. Now, Jolie has revealed more details on her divorce in an interview with Entertainment Today. “No relationship is ever just black-and-white, and while Brad and I have such different points of view regarding numerous matters, what lead to our divorce primarily were different ideas of how to bring our children up,” the actor said. “His addiction to alcohol was the reason why he lost many opportunities in Hollywood. He was even jealous because I wouldn't let him promote my business. Nonetheless, he's the father of my children and I don't want to talk about it too much.” Together, the actors are parents to six children: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox Jolie-Pitt. 
This isn't the first time the topic of Pitt's battle with substance abuse has come up. In 2017, Brad Pitt spoke about his addiction in his GQ interview, saying "I can't remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn't boozing or had a spliff, or something. Something. And you realise that a lot of it is, um—cigarettes, you know, pacifiers." 
Currently, Jolie is working on Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (the sequel to 2014's Maleficent), which will release in October 2019. Pitt will be seen this year in two films: Ad Astra, in which he will be seen playing an astronaut, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which hits theatres this July.

The Duchess of Sussex got a new position and declared her yet-to-be-born child’s feminist feelings all in one day 
Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, had a busy International Women's Day, noting her blossoming baby bump is home to, she hopes, a burgeoning feminist. 
Meghan Markle lent her voice to the International Women's Day panel hosted by the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, an organisation the new royal was named vice president of that same day. 
Prince Harry is currently president of the organisation, of which Queen Elizabeth II is patron, which aims to support and educate the youth of the Commonwealth who are change-makers inspired to make a difference, “no matter how small”, within their environment. 
“In this new role, the Duchess will highlight the Trust's partnerships with young people across the Commonwealth, and in particular its work supporting women and girls,” a statement announcing the appointment reads. 
In her first act as vice president, Markle spoke alongside Annie Lennox OBE, Adwoa Aboah, Julia Gillard, Chrisann Jarrett, Angeline Murimirwa and Anne McElvoy, senior editor of The Economist, who moderated the conversation. The women touched on all manner of subjects including education, challenging stereotypes and Netflix. 
Markle revealed during the discussion that yes, she does watch the streaming service and that one documentary in particular, Feminists: What Were They Thinking?, made an impact on her. 
Per Town & Country, Markle noted, “I had seen this documentary on Netflix about feminism, and one of the things they said during pregnancy was ‘I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism.' I loved that, so boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that that's the case with our little bump.” 
That embryonic kicking of feminism is surely being felt around Kensington Palace at the moment and we can't but help love the idea. 
Markle also revealed her secret to avoiding the negativity on social media, when the topic of disrespectful comments directed to women in positions of power flood social platforms. 
“I don't look at [Twitter]... But I do read The Economist,” Markle noted, adding, it's better to focus your attentions on journalism that's tackling real issues rather than “muddling” your attentions. 
While we now know for sure that Markle and her prince watch Netflix just like you and your significant other, we wonder what else the pair are spending their free time watching? We totally see Markle as a big Connie Britton fan, bingeing Dirty John in one night. 
We also can't help but be inspired by that embryonic kick of feminism literally fluttering around the duchess's womb right now!

This one is Jennifer Lopez’s fifth engagement ring, so it was always going to be noteworthy 
Over the weekend America's favourite celebrity couple, Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, or J.Lo and A-Rod, as they're respectively also known, got engaged to be married. 
The former professional baseball player, 43, proposed to his 49-year-old actress, singer, dancer, producer girlfriend of two years during a romantic trip to the Bahamas. According to E! News the proposal was a surprise with a source revealing that although A-Rod had been telling friends he planned to propose to J.Lo this year, he hadn't specified when. 
“Even though this trip to the Bahamas has been planned for a few weeks, friends had no idea that Alex would be popping the question this weekend,” the source told E! News. “Alex kept all of the details surrounding his ring shopping and his proposal very private—almost everyone in their inner circle was caught by surprise when Jennifer posted the photo of the ring.” 
Both Rodriguez and Lopez shared their engagement news via social media, taking to their individual Instagram accounts to post a picture of the spectacular sparkler. A-Rod captioned his with “She said yes” and Lopez captioned hers with multiple love heart emojis. 
Of course the internet immediately went into meltdown once the news was out with well-wishers posting congratulatory messages on the newly-engaged couples' Instagram accounts. The internet was also very interested in the ring itself which looks to be an extremely large emerald-cut diamond. 
The president of SuperJewler.com, Andrew Fox, told one publication he guesses the ring “is an emerald cut [diamond] of between 11 carats and 15 carats”. E! News reports the ring is estimated to be worth “between [US]$1 million and [US]$5 million.” A staggering amount for an engagement ring, but as this is Lopez's fifth engagement it's no surprise A-Rod selected a ring that would make a statement. 
And it's worked out, a source told E! News the ‘Jenny from the Block' singer “absolutely loves the ring Alex selected for her.” The proposal was also a complete surprise to J.Lo even though she reportedly knew A-Rod always planned to marry her one day. 
“They've been madly in love since very early on in the relationship and he has made it very clear he wanted to marry her,” the source told E! News. “But she had no idea it was going to happen on this trip.” 
As for those other engagement rings J.Lo has worn in the past—J.Lo has been engaged four times previously with various big rocks to show for it. 
Lopez was married to her first husband, waiter Ojani Noa, for two years and per E! News that engagement ring was a pear-shaped diamond. Then in 2001, J.Lo married her back-up dancer, Cris Judd, who had proposed to Lopez with an emerald-cut diamond ring. Engagement number three was to Oscar-winner Ben Affleck. J.Lo called this engagement off prior to the wedding but during their engagement sported a huge pink diamond ring from Harry Winston. 
Husband number three, Marc Anthony, gave J.Lo her fourth engagement rock, another blindingly large diamond from Harry Winston, which was reportedly worth around US$4 million. 
Which brings us to engagement number five to A-Rod. Congratulations to the happy couple!

From Maroon 5 and Honey Singh's special performances to party selfies, here's a look at all the action from inside Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's post-nuptial celebrations in Mumbai 
A day after Mukesh and Nita Ambani's older son, Akash Ambani tied the knot with childhood friend Shloka Mehta, the newly-weds' families hosted a post-wedding bash on the evening of March 10. Held at the same venue as the wedding, Jio World Centre, Mumbai, last evening's celebration was as star-studded as anticipated, and was attended by Bollywood stars and note-worthy names from the country's political and business world. While you may have already checked out everyone's wedding-ready looks from the celebration, you may have missed the biggest inside moments from the evening that was. Catch up on all the #AkuStoleTheShlo action now! 
After Chris Martin of Coldplay and The Chainsmokers performed at Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's pre-wedding bash in St Moritz last month, the Ambanis sought out the talent of another globally-loved band for the couple's post-wedding bash. Maroon 5, the American band that's reportedly a favourite of Akash and Shloka's, was seen playing out its top hits at the newlyweds' post-wedding celebration yesterday, and their time at the celebration also marked their maiden performance in India. One of the sweetest moments from the evening was when Akash Ambani took his bride up on stage to dance as Adam Levine sang one of Maroon 5's most popular tracks, ‘She Will be Loved'. The band also made sure to treat their guests to one of their newest songs, 'Girls Like You'. 
But what's an Indian wedding without some upbeat Bollywood tracks? After Maroon 5, Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's guests were also seen clapping along with rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh, who performed some of his most-loved songs including 'Dope Shope'. 
Some of the many stars in attendance last night included Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Karisma Kapoor, Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna, Sidharth Malhotra, Kajol, Rekha and Amitabh Bachchan, all of whom made sure to congratulate Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta on their big day. Through the course of the evening, several celebrity guests also took to their Instagram pages to share some party pictures from their night out. While Lara Dutta Bhupathi posed in her festive wear with Dia Mirza, Riteish Deshmukh and Kriti Sanon, Shilpa Shetty Kundra caught up with couturier Manish Malhotra, who designed the bride's lehenga-sari and the Ambani family for the evening, and Bollywood icon Rekha. 
Tonight, the Ambani and Mehta families will host a wedding reception in the couple's honour.

Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta both welcomed guests to the post-wedding celebrations in Manish Malhotra looks. Take a closer look at then ensembles now 
After tying the knot at BKC's Jio World Centre yesterday, Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta, and their families, hosted a lavish post-wedding party for their friends and family at the same venue this evening. The new bride made an appearance for the eager paparazzi in an embellished, champagne-hued lehenga sari by Manish Malhotra, while groom Akash Ambani complemented her in a navy blue sherwani, also by the designer. 
For her bridal lehenga, Mehta chose a traditional red number by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. However, for the festivities tonight, she went with a glamorous option by one of the most favoured couturiers in the country, who also happened to have lent his creative vision to the overall direction of the wedding—Manish Malhotra. Mehta's ornate lehenga sari featured intricate jaali work and rose gold Swarovski crystals, transforming the drape into something worthy of the red carpet. 
Jewellery wise, Mehta picked an elegant diamond necklace with matching bangles in contrast to that heavy emerald and jadau necklace she wore for the pheras. The new bride chose a luminous, base, a light smoky eye and a pinkish nude lip for her makeup, and wore her hair open in slight waves. 
Shloka Mehta's sartorial sensibilities have been simple yet impactful as was the case with her ensemble for the reception. Scroll through the slideshow to take a closer peek at her recent look.

The latest pictures on Instagram show the Bollywood brigade trickling into the multi-use venue for Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's continued wedding festivities.

Vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardists Jesse Carmichael and PJ Morton, bassist Mickey Madden and guitarist James Valentine from the American band will be taking to stage later on in the evening at the lavish venue. Tomorrow, March 10, will see yet another function held by the Ambani and Mehta clan.

Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani tied the knot at Mumbai's Jio World Centre centre yesterday. The bride wore a custom Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla lehenga 
The Ambanis don't do anything by half measures. World leaders, top ranking management in some of the biggest companies in the world and of course Bollywood have made their way to the Jio World Centre in BKC, Mumbai to be a part of Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani's wedding celebrations. After sighting gentry, one finally got a chance to take a look at the bride who picked an elaborate lehenga by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla for her big day. 
Mehta's lehenga featured intricate cut work jaali in zardozi with fine zardozi and jadau embroidery. Her stunning blouse was embellished with in zardozi maal and jadau. Mehta opted for two dupattas--the one on the shoulder bore a trellis formation of floral motifs and another one with bootis over her head. The bridal red of her outfit was contrasted by heavy jadau and emerald necklaces. Akash Ambani complemented her in a pale gold sherwani. 
The couture duo is a popular choice for the Ambani household and it's no wonder Shloka Mehta too opted for their creation for her wedding. Mehta's personal style has always been demure and her choice of lehenga perfectly exemplified that.

If there's one thing you can count on Karan Johar for, it's creating magic on the silver screen. From Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001) to Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016) and Dhadak (2018), the Bollywood director's movies have taken his audiences on countless journeys with some of the best stars in the business, and it doesn't look like he'll be slowing down anytime soon. In the coming year alone, Dharma Productions several new projects coming out, but one that seems especially close to Johar's heart is Kalank. Over the past day, Bollywood fans have finally got to see some glimpses from the movie, and you can't miss them. 
Starring Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha and Aditya Roy Kapur, Kalank seems to tell a heart-wrenching tale of love. While March 7 had the film's cast revealing the looks of the three #MenOfKalank, today, Women's Day, will have them finally sharing the women's looks. So far, we've already seen Alia Bhatt as 'Roop', and it's safe to say no one's seen the star in an avatar like this before. Wearing traditional Indian jewellery and a ghungat over her head, Alia Bhatt looks every bit the royal in her new Kalank poster, and the sneak peek has earned thousands of likes and comments in just 15 minutes! 
The movie, which seems to belong in an olden era, comes with a special story of its own. On March 6, Karan Johar took to his Instagram account to share the logo of his movie along with a mysterious movie still. Johar also shared a message telling his fans why Kalank is so important to him, describing it as "the last film my father worked on before he left us". "It was his dream to see this film come through," Johar revealed. "I couldn't fulfil his dream then... my spirit was broken... but today his wish has found a relationship with celluloid... the story of turbulent relationships and eternal love has found a voice." 
With so much history behind it, it's safe to say that this movie's been made with a lot of love, and is bound to be an exciting watch. Missed the rest of the cast's look for the movie? Catch up via our slideshow.

How smart is your audience? What does it mean to be an outspoken feminist in India? Kusha Kapila talks about her journey from writer to internet sensation and the importance of staying true to oneself 
Ask a millennial in India who Kusha Kapila is and they might not have an answer. Ask them about Billi Maasi and you'll hear the sound of the Edison bulb lighting up. Larger than her own self is the persona created by an eloquent, contained and sharp woman who was once an aspiring journalist—Kusha Kapila rose from the writing desk at iDiva to become a talent that is now recognised by her many comic alter egos. From Karan Johar to the Ambanis, Kapila is known to anyone staying abreast with what's relevant in the country's pop culture scene. 
Famous for sketches that take digs at the country's rich, her content is hilarious yet nuanced and manages to take on challenging conversations about the many issues women face in India. Is Instagram too limited a space for her work? Kapila might soon be branching on creating her own YouTube channel, and is even taking a stab at stand-up. Being constantly in touch with those interacting with her work, the internet sensation has had several learnings. Vogue gets in conversation with Kusha Kapila on what it means to be an influencer in India, served with a side of her endearing personality. 
It's all by accident. We got into a very hectic Facebook deal, where we had to come up with daily content. Santu [Misra, national creative head, Times Internet] at that point went like, “I am going to take charge of the situation, and I am going to make sure all the girls are in front of the camera.” When we started, there were maybe one or two channels that were doing very safe video content, and weren't really asking the uncomfortable questions. Our videos had a lot of sass—we were talking about women being called crazy, being eve teased on the roads, and we were doing these really funny characters who were saying important things. 
Somewhere it is a kind of commentary on the elite culture. Santu and I discussed what comedians believe in—although we don't think we are qualified comedians—that when you make content, never punch down, punch up. Do not make comedy at the expense of people who are marginalised or going through a hard time. That's why when we made South Delhi Girls and people were like, “Oh my god, you are stereotyping women”, we didn't think too much of it. We were women who wanted to make content for women, and we could only represent women. Initially, South Delhi Girls was just our commentary on class differences between cities and how different they are to each other. And once we really got into it, it genuinely became like a parody on this culture, of the things that they very casually say. These are real things that people have said in front of us; we've probably just exaggerated them by like five per cent. They are more privileged than most people in the country. Nothing will happen to their equity if we make a few jokes at their expense. 
Billi Masi is a person I have actually met in real life. I met her when I was 19, at a friend's relatives' party at Chattarpur Farms, and I was in awe of her. There I was sitting like a fly on the wall just observing everybody—it was the crème de la crème of the society, everyone in their designer finery. And there she was—this middle-aged woman, and everybody was egging her on to sing and she was like, “No I won't sing today.” But then she just sat and went to this meditative pose and sang ‘Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo'—it was just incredible. 
Most of the characters I play are inspired by real life; DJ Aarti is from the side of town I come from. I have had siblings and cousins who talk like that. I come from a very religious family and my mom's a god-fearing person; Gurri di Mummy is a very exaggerated version of my mother. Naina is every girl in South Delhi ever. I have studied in Delhi, I was surrounded by a lot of South Delhi girls and they are a whole mood; they are a different species altogether. 
Writing just helps you so much more. You are able to translate situations better for the camera, you know the words that will stay with people, you know the slang that people will take home with them. ‘Shivoham' and ‘riyaaz' were inspired by people I had written about or profiled at some point, and these were phrases that they used. 
Now when I make my own content, I first start by writing how I would as a writer. I go through the lines and then we sort of perform them. So, the transition was actually pretty easy. It wasn't something I was uncomfortable with either, because I have some background in performance from when I was in college, but I never took it seriously. I don't think that 10 years ago, we could have thought of this as a career option. I have been working as a writer for seven years and being a video star happened to me in my late 20s. Half of the time I feel like, ‘Oh god, is it too late?' But that's the best thing about the internet—it doesn't matter when you start your journey. It doesn't matter if I'm 30 or a mom, or a person with two failed careers. If your story is unique, it will resonate with people. 
Because I started my career in digital, I know that there are no formulas. I have written clickbait headlines. When I left iDiva as a writer I had the maximum number of page views, so I know what works for people. What you need to realise is that people on the internet are very smart. If you are making a very evident effort to curate your personality and your feed, they will call you out. 
I got into this knowing that at no point can I pretend to be somebody I am not. That's how people accepted me. The whole ‘I am married, and I am sort of building my life on my own, I am doing my own apartment and everything' situation is my narrative. And it's something that a lot of young adults especially relate with. I have never had to curate my personality or who I am or my feed. The only thing I made sure of was posting consistently, because that is key. [Because I needed to] consistently put work out there, I just on sort of started deriving content from my own life. If I've had a tooth extraction, I will do something around it because this is what I'm feeling. I don't go to unbelievable lengths to make content, because that's not me at all. 
I actually had a bit of a revelation last year, I went for a wedding to the Andamans and my phone didn't work for a week and I died. I was like, what is this life? I had this massive existential crisis. Is this my life? Is my phone, my Instagram account, what I am limited to? Because, genuinely, if there were no phones, if there were no Instagram accounts, what would I even be? Is that all to my personality? And it was a very, very, scary thought. That's when I decided I need to branch out have a more tangible presence, maybe a live show or a web series this year. 
It's nice because I don't think they really look at me as a celebrity, because I am not one. I believe a lot of my followers think that they are a part of my life; they know Zorawar (my husband), they know the kind of life I have. Because I share 20 per cent of my personal life on Instagram, they feel included in the whole narrative of who I am. People believe I'm accessible, so that is one of the major differences between an internet content curator and a celebrity. They will never approach a celebrity the way they approach me. 
I've had this guy shove his camera in my face and show me the middle finger when I said that I don't want to get clicked. When people meet somebody they like or admire, they completely lose sense of consent—they won't respect your space, they won't respect the fact that you are a real person and that you would want to be treated like one. It doesn't matter what gender you belong to. 
But if you ask me, I love all this—I love meeting new people, I love getting feedback for my work. So many times I have gotten into long discussions about a particular sketch that I did and why I did it and the thought behind it. People have real questions to ask me, which is great; I really enjoy that. 
A lot of my content is for women, and I don't mind saying that. And if you are a man enjoying my content then honestly my work is half done. If it's reforming you in any way, it's awesome, because I talk about a lot of issues that are close to women. I talk about body positivity, about loving yourself, about sexism, about feminism, I speak about all the issues that must be spoken about, but obviously infuse them with my humour. But I do attract a lot of hate from men. If you are getting offended with the work that I'm doing, I think I am making a difference. 
There's a little content piece that I do called 'Kavita ki Kavita' that I have never actually sold to any brand because I like poetry. I wanted to make something using millennial slang that everybody could enjoy, and that wasn't too heavy. I remember, before the #MeToo movement exploded, I wrote about eve-teasing, catcalling. After a few Kavita ki Kavita videos, people actually sent me ideas on what topics to approach next. When #MeToo happened, they asked me where my piece on the movement was. In that moment, I felt under pressure because I knew it had to be very strong, it had to raise the right questions and it had to say the right thing. 
On Instagram you have a one-minute window, I had to say everything I needed to say, and it needed to have closure. So I actually wrote what it on paper, shot it, and I put it out there. And the outpouring of love and what my viewers felt about the piece... it was incredible. At that point, I didn't do it for the views. I felt that as a content creator, I needed to have a real purpose to what I am doing and why I am doing it. 
I felt it when I just started, when I was in the middle of it, when my follower count was increasing, but humour comes naturally to me. The pressure is on when something happens in the country; people make you feel the need comment on it. 
When I worked with Kareena [Kapoor Khan], I was full of nerves. It was my first video and I was just so scared, and it was a big deal that Rhea Kapoor gave us that opportunity so early on. Our content was just getting out there. We did what we had to do but we felt confident because, here's the deal—they understand movies, we understand the internet. So, at least in your mind, you feel like it's a level playing field. 
It's a great collaboration because we have our loyal audience and they obviously have an entire nation that is loyal to them. It's a great meeting of forces. I remember when we were filming something with Abhishek Bachchan, and ten seconds into the rehearsal he's like “What! You are so good. How can you even do this?” I think that broke the ice between us. I have had no bad experiences, and probably because everybody is so digital savvy now, that they realise this is only going to benefit them. Vicky Kaushal gave like three takes for this really funny video and when you see him performing, you know he put his life into it. I think most of the actors also realise the engagement and the massive reach of the platform. And now with Netflix and Amazon Prime, you realise this is all coming together. 
I always wanted to be a journalist. I actually wanted to cover a war, I remember, because Kargil happened when we were growing up and we used to watch Barkha Dutt—it had a very lasting impact on me. But obviously I realised there's only so much I can do. I always wanted to write and that's exactly what I did. I had a brief acting stint in college. I used to do street plays and there was a period when I actually considered theatre, but never acting. 
My mom is actually not surprised at all. I faced absolutely no backlash of any kind from my parents; they've been extremely supportive. They are all proud of me and just happy that I finally know my worth, because they always thought I was undermining myself. For my family, it's just like 'wow, this stupidity of yours has actually become a career'.

Tired of your life here and looking to move out? Iceland, Sweden and New Zealand should be on top of every woman's list 
If you've ever dreamed about living and working in the United States, you might want to think again. Released ahead of International Women's Day on March 8, the PriceWaterhouse Coopers' annual ranking of the representation and welfare of women in the workplace across 33 OECD countries has ranked the US and UK 23rd and 13th, respectively. 
China and India were not included in the study as non-OECD nations. However, China would rank 27th, just ahead of Japan, while India would rank at the bottom, behind Korea, because of low levels of female participation. While 2019 marks another year of continued steps to achieve gender equality in the world of work, looks like there's still ground for India to cover. 
In the list, Iceland, Sweden and New Zealand held the first three places, and Nordic countries took five of the top 10. According to the report published on Tuesday in London, the rewards are great for getting more women into work in these countries. The UK could match the levels seen in Sweden only by increasing female employment, according to PwC. 
In India, the numbers look bleak because of fewer women at work to begin with—which remains a key drag on our progress. But according to the report, India can see a huge boost in female earnings by closing the gender pay gap, and an increase in GDP by increasing the female employment rate to the level of Sweden. Unlocking the potential of women within a country with a large population could be the best route for India. 
The PwC Women in Work Index has been compiled after considering the situation of gender pay gap, female participation, unemployment, full-time employment rate and more, in each country.

It's official: Beauty entrepreneur Kylie Jenner has earned the number one spot that previously belonged to Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg 
At the tender age of 21 most people are barely liquid, still live at home and probably have zero assets to their name, but not Kylie Jenner. The 21-year-old beauty entrepreneur has just been crowned by Forbes as the youngest ever self-made billionaire thanks to the beauty brand she founded, Kylie Cosmetics, just four years ago in 2015. 
That's right, in less than five years, Jenner has built a business which is so profitable and successful she is now in the billionaires club and has even managed to knock the previous youngest self-made billionaire, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, out of the number one spot (per Forbes, Zuckerberg was 23 we he made it into the billion dollar club). 
Forbes estimates Jenner's cosmetics company is “worth at least US$900 million” which combined with the money Jenner has already made from the business, has made the mother-of-one a billionaire. 
“I didn't expect anything. I did not foresee the future,” Jenner told Forbes. “But [the recognition] feels really good. That's a nice pat on the back.” 
How did she do it? Jenner has been business savvy from the beginning, she owns 100 per cent of the business and until last year, when she signed an exclusive deal with huge US beauty chain Ulta, the business was online only with the occasional pop-up store, so costs were kept to a minimum. 
Indeed Forbes says the business is “just seven full-time and five part-time employees [with] manufacturing and packaging outsourced to Seed Beauty, a private-label producer in nearby Oxnard, California. Sales and fulfilment are handled by online merchant Shopify.” And of course her mum, Kris Jenner, is in charge of “finance and PR in exchange for the 10 per cent management fee she siphons from all her kids.” 
Social media has driven much of the brand's extraordinary success which Jenner already had a huge presence on prior to launching the brand. “It's the power of social media,” Jenner told Forbes. “I had such a strong reach before I was able to start anything.” 
As for how she's celebrating hitting billionaire status at just 21, it sounds like she'll be celebrating with more hard work. “I see [the brand] going very far. I work really hard,” Jenner told Forbes. Although, surely she'll make time for at least one celebratory selfie to share with her fans on social media first?

According to estimates by WHO, seven million people around the world die annually from exposure to air pollution 
March 5, 2019 brought a much-needed reality check with it for Indians. The IQAir AirVisual Report 2018, created in collaboration with Greenpeace Southeast Asia, showed India as one of the most polluted regions in the world. Out of the 3,000 cities evaluated for the report, as many as 22 cities that cross the WHO bar at PM2.5 (particulate matter, tiny airborne particles) are located in the country, with Delhi topping the list. 
An article published on Greenpeace.org had Yeb Saño, executive director, Greenpeace Southeast Asia, commenting on the latest reports. “Air pollution steals our livelihoods and our futures, but we can change that. In addition to human lives lost, there's an estimated global cost of 225 billion dollars in lost labour, and trillions in medical costs. This has enormous impacts on our health and on our wallets. We want this report to make people think about the air we breathe because when we understand the impact of air quality on our lives. We will act to protect what's most important,” he said. 
According to the report, India alone faces two million premature deaths due to air pollution, with Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, Faisalabad, Noida and Patna ranking among the most polluted cities in the world. Moreover, it has also revealed some harsh truths about India. “Multiple databases on air quality, including recent report Airpocalypse-III by Greenpeace India, have reminded us of how air pollution is impacting our daily lives in India,” it said. 
If the news has you startled and questioning whether this reality can be changed at all, take solace in the fact that it has in fact been done before. Beijing once topped the list of the most polluted cities in the world but this rank came down drastically over the years, with the city hitting an astonishingly low 122 in the 2019 report. “Beijing is showing us that it can be done, as many other cities in Europe and US have over the past decades too,” environmental activist Pujarini Sen, who works with Greenpeace India, told a news publication. “We have enough research and studies suggesting the way ahead towards a breathable India, but the question that remains to be answered is whether there is enough political will to aggressively fight the health emergency India faces today, and move away from polluting fuels and practices of past.”

While Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, Sara Ali Khan and others send Janhvi Kapoor good wishes on her big day, the actor is celebrating her birthday with a peaceful family getaway 
Janhvi Kapoor might be only one movie old in Bollywood, but the elder daughter of late actor Sridevi and producer Boney Kapoor has already become a household name. March 6, 2019, marks the budding star's 22nd birthday, and Kapoor has already begun to receive lots of love and wishes on her big day via social media. Along with the wishes shared on her countless fan pages, one of the most adorable birthday posts to crop up on Instagram so far comes from Kapoor's cousin, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, who shared a throwback picture this morning from when Kapoor was just a baby. The snapshot, which shows a teen Sonam cradling little Janhvi on her lap was captioned “Happy happy birthday baby jannu... all my love baby girl... keep smiling your gorgeous smile.. @janhvikapoor”. 
And that's not all! Showering some more birthday love on 22 year-old today was the actor's aunt Maheep Kapoor, who shared an album of never-seen-before childhood pictures of the star having a blast with sisters Khushi Kapoor and Shanaya Kapoor. As the day progressed, Kapoor's only brother, Arjun Kapoor took to his page to wish the actor as well, with a tongue-in-cheek caption. Check it out below. 
Another super sweet wish you can't miss out on is fellow actor Sara Ali Khan's.

While the world loads up our social media feeds with good wishing for Janhvi Kapoor, the 22-year-old decided to bring in her birthday last evening away from the city. Last night, Kapoor cut her birthday cake dressed in an ivory kurta set at the Taj Nadesar Palace, Benares, as her father Boney Kapoor and little sister Khushi clapped and sang for her. Kapoor also performed a puja at Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple to start her birthday on an auspicious note. This morning, the birthday girl took to Instagram to share a picture of her father holding a newspaper and packs of chocolates by a sprawling garden, and captioned the sun-kissed picture "best gift ever". Just hours later, she also shared this snapshot of herself enjoying a peaceful boat ride in Benares. The caption that comes with it is all about positivity.

In a recent interview, Priyanka Chopra spoke out against internet trolls, living in the digital world and the pressure that comes with it 
Followed by millions of people on a daily basis, Priyanka Chopra is no stranger to living life in the public eye. But it comes as no surprise that global fame comes with "crazy pressure" of its own, and recently, the actor broke the silence on what it's really like for celebrities such as herself to deal with internet trolls. "Most of the time, I see the media writing about trolling, that someone got trolled for this and that. I have never understood how somebody's opinion becomes news. How the media gives such credence to maybe 500, 600 or 1,000 people writing behind the anonymity of the computer," Chopra said in the interview, also adding that the "glorification of trolling has added the crazy pressure on to entertainers. Those are the pressures that are not even created by us or the fans. It is just created by the one thing which is the internet. It has has made people's job easier... You can make a story out of anybody's comment." 
During her talk, Chopra also touched upon her own experiences with trolls, and how she makes sure to never succumb to the negativity on the internet, whether she's being talked about for her personal views on current affairs, her wardrobe, or her wedding. "I have not been someone who has lived my life according to somebody else. I have walked to the beat of my own drum but I am very cognisant of somebody's feelings as a public person. There is something called living your life according to the social responsibility that you feel as an individual, and then there is something else, like living your life according to how everybody else wants to you to live. And that is not the world we should live in.” Of course, celebrities aren't the only ones who have to face social media trolls in the digital age. "Our children should not be taught that people's opinions are that important," Chopra said. "When they get bullied in school or when they get bullied as teenagers because of the comments written on Instagram, it leads them to depression, leading them to take harsh decisions in their life." 
On the professional front, Priyanka Chopra will soon be seen sharing screen space with Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim in The Sky Is Pink, and also took over the internet in the new music video of 'Sucker' by the Jonas Brothers, which marks her very first work project with husband Nick Jonas.

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are easily one of India's most-followed celebrity couples.

When it comes to friends, Meghan Markle likes to keep hers close. From A-listers Serena Williams and Priyanka Chopra to old uni pals and girls from her Suits days, Vogue takes a look at who’s who in the royal’s inner circle 
Meghan Markle may now be a fully-fledged royal, but she definitely hasn't forgotten her friends from her pre-Prince Harry days. Last week, she jetted to New York for a lavish baby shower in the penthouse suite of The Mark Hotel, thrown by A-list pals Serena Williams and Amal Clooney, along with university friend Genevieve Hillis. Also in attendance were former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's rumoured matchmaker, fashion designer Misha Nonoo. 
Markle's inner circle have been consistently loyal supporters amid various reports of her strained relationship with her father and press stories of Palace staff branding her “Duchess Difficult”. Earlier this month, five female friends spoke out anonymously in defence of Meg—as they refer to the royal—to counter the rumours and confirm that she hasn't changed since her marriage to Harry. 
From old university friends to celebrity stars, Vogue takes a look at who's in the Duchess of Sussex's girl gang.

Her unofficial stylist and matron-of-honour in all but name at the royal wedding last May, Jessica Mulroney is undoubtedly one of the Duchess's closest friends. The pair met after Markle moved to Toronto to film Suits in 2011, often appearing in each other's Instagram feeds. While her royal romance was still under wraps, Markle and Prince Harry reportedly stayed with Mulroney and her TV-host husband Ben in Canada, demonstrating the level of trust between the two women. The stylist's three children—twins Brian and John, eight, and Ivy, five—acted as page boys and bridesmaid at the royal wedding; while Mulroney, who now has her own fashion segment on Good Morning America, is believed to have styled the Duchess's royal tour wardrobe last year.

One of the Duchess's actor friends, Priyanka Chopra and Markle bonded after meeting at a Women in Television dinner at the start of 2016. Later that year, Markle described the Bollywood star as “unbelievable”, adding that “she has become a really good friend”. While Chopra was among the starry guests at the royal wedding last May, she is believed to have missed Markle's baby shower this month due to work commitments. Meanwhile, Markle—who is expecting her first baby in April—did not make the trip to India for Chopra and Nick Jonas's lavish wedding in December.

Tennis champion Serena Williams became firm friends with Markle after they met at the Super Bowl in 2010, according to People. The Duchess cheered Williams on at Wimbledon in 2016 and last summer the pair enjoyed a day out at the polo. Speaking about how they have helped one another deal with media scrutiny, Williams said in September: “We have known each other for a long time, but we really are relying on each other a lot lately.” The Duchess showed her support for Williams's fashion line while in Australia last October, sporting the Boss Blazer, while the tennis star recently designed a Royal Duchess hoodie, which she sent to Kensington Palace.

While actor Abigail Spencer is known for starring in Suits with Meghan Markle, the pair first became friends years before that after meeting at an audition. The two women share the same birthday, too—August 4, 1981—and in an interview in May 2018 with Entertainment Tonight Spencer said: “We were born on the same day, hours apart, in the same year... she's a trusted friend and one of the most glorious people I have ever met." Spencer, who was among the best-dressed guests at the royal wedding in an Alessandra Rich polka-dot dress, recently enjoyed lunch in New York with Markle ahead of her baby shower. The Duchess even sported a baseball cap branded Rectify, the Sundance drama that Spencer starred in, as she left the city.

Widely considered to be the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's matchmaker, Misha Nonoo is another key member of Markle's inner circle. The fashion designer previously revealed how she and the former actor were introduced by a mutual friend at a lunch in Miami and “got along like a house on fire”. Markle famously wore Nonoo's Boyfriend shirt at her first public appearance with Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in Toronto in September 2017, and more recently chose a black cashmere crew-neck jumper by the designer while touring Morocco. Although Nonoo is known for her friendship with Markle, she is no stranger to the royal family. Her ex-husband Alexander Gilkes is a friend of Prince William and Prince Harry, while she is also close to Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

While many of Markle's closest friends are based across the Atlantic, Amal Clooney forms part of the Duchess's support base in the UK. The pair are believed to have met through a mutual friend, with Clooney helping Markle to settle into her new life following her engagement to Prince Harry. The Sussexes reportedly stayed with Clooney and husband George at their villa by Lake Como last summer, while their Cotswolds bolthole is close to the Clooney's Berkshire home. The friendship between the two couples was shown when George Clooney recently spoke out in Markle's defence, suggesting that the royal had been “pursued and vilified” in the media.

Fellow Northwestern alumni Lindsay Roth is among the Duchess's oldest friends. The TV producer and author met Markle in her freshman year at university, while they were both taking a Toni Morrison literature class. Speaking about her friendship with the Duchess in 2017, Roth said: “I don't know many people who are as generous and supportive as Meg is.” Markle was maid-of-honour at Roth's wedding in 2016, and may have been the inspiration behind her book What Pretty Girls Are Made Of, which is about an aspiring actress.

As godmother to her two daughters, the Duchess is clearly close to entertainment lawyer turned entrepreneur Benita Litt. Markle shared a now-deleted Instagram post of her and the family in 2016, in which she described Litt's children Rylan and Remi—who acted as bridesmaids at her wedding—as her “fairy god-daughters”. Litt also appears to share the Duchess's passion for fashion, co-founding travel bag brand Legend of Lido in 2016.

On being cast as a young Janhvi Kapoor for the upcoming biopic of IAF pilot Gunjan Saxena, child actor Riva Arora took to Instagram to share her big news 
After the roaring success of her debut film Dhadak, Janhvi Kapoor is now all set to take on an entirely new role. The young actor will be stepping into the shoes of the first female IAF pilot Gunjan Saxena in an upcoming biopic based on her life. But that's not the most exciting part—Kapoor will also be sharing screen space with a young Riva Arora, who played the role of Sridevi's daughter in Mom (2017), and will be seen as a young Janhvi Kapoor in the film. Arora was last spotted in Uri: The Surgical Strike, apart from television series Mere Papa: Hero Harilal (2018) and Naina (2018). 
Elated to be working with Janhvi Kapoor, Arora took to Instagram to share her excitement. “With Janhvi kapoor - Lovely personality, Same i met her during MOM movie shoot, And today shooting with her. time changes but some people never change, Same love same sweetness full of life, Proud working with amazing personalities, Thank u sonal di for recommending me and thank u casting director jogi sir for casting me 🤩,” she wrote in her caption, posting a picture with Janhvi. Scroll ahead to see Sridevi's reel and real daughters in a single frame. 
In case you didn't know it, Gunjan Saxena was the first female combat pilot who entered the Kargil war zone in 1999. Janhvi Kapoor was spotted in Lucknow recently, where she began shooting for the biopic in which she will be seen alongside veteran actor Pankaj Kapur who is playing the role of her father, and Angad Bedi, who is said to be her onscreen brother. 
But this is not all you have to look forward to from the Dhadak actor in the near future. The actor also features on Karan Johar's Takht, said to release in 2020, which will have her co-starring with Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pednekar and Anil Kapoor.

“Yes, people saw love, and guess what? That’s what we wanted you to see.” 
Following her Best Song Oscar win, Lady Gaga has appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, using the opportunity to shut down rumours that she and Bradley Cooper are secretly in love. The unfound rumours began directly after the Oscars ceremony, fuelled by her performance of 'Shallow', alongside Cooper, which is the very song she won the Oscar for. The pair took to the Oscars stage to perform the A Star is Born hit song together, with Lady Gaga playing piano and the pair both singing, and the performance ending with Cooper joining Gaga at the piano together. Many social media users took the performance a little too literally, assuming they were in love and pointing out that Cooper's partner, Irina Shayk, was in the audience watching on. Lady Gaga decided to clarify things for everyone at home. 
“First of all, social media, quite frankly, is the toilet of the internet,” Lady Gaga told Jimmy Kimmel when asked about the reaction. “What it has done to pop culture is abysmal. And yes, people saw love, and guess what? That's what we wanted you to see.” 
She continued: “This is a love song, Shallow, the movie, A Star Is Born, is a love story. We worked so hard, we worked all week on that performance.” 
Lady Gaga, 32, who just split with her fiancé Christian Carino, also shared a bit of background on how the live rendition came about, confirming that every moment was planned and that they were indeed acting their parts from the film. “Bradley – and I have never relinquished control of a live stage performance and I've done a million of them – he directed this film and he directed all of the musical performances in the film. He directed, obviously, Shallow, the moment in the film, so I knew that he had the vision for how it should go. So I was like, you know, what do you think Bradley? So everything that you saw, the way that it was shot, the way that they pushed the piano out, you saw them put the piano together, and us walk onstage, [there was] no intro – all of it – that was all him. Even also, he was the one that was like, I think that the audience should be lit. So we're not just lit but the audience is lit.” 
“It was just great and from a performance perspective it was so important to both of us that we were connected the entire time.”She went on to jokingly compare the reaction to that of her tour with 92-year-old Tony Bennett. “I mean, look, I've had my arms wrapped around Tony Bennett for three years touring the world, I mean, when you're singing love songs, that's what you want people to feel.” When Kimmel joked that perhaps this means she's having an affair with Bennett, Lady Gaga laughed. 
“I'm an artist and I guess we did a good job. Fooled ya!”

The floral mehandi motif signifies good luck for the mom-to-be 
Meghan Markle is currently at the end of her Royal Tour to Morocco, one of her last before she takes a break from public engagements to get ready for her delivery. As part of their itinerary, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex visited the girls at the Education for All boarding house in the Atlas mountains, which looks after the safe stay of girls in the region in order for them to have a proper access to their education. 
While there, she had mehandi applied as a little souvenir of the trip, and to commemorate her pregnancy. People reported that the henna tattoo was in a floral motif, running from the start of her index finger to her wrist forming a lovely good luck charm for the expecting mother. 
Henna has been used for years by people from various cultures to celebrate auspicious occasions and rites of passage (more about the history of bridal mehandi, here). "It's for when we have a big party," Khadeja Oukattou, one of the school's housemothers, told People. "Now she is pregnant, we do the henna to keep her happy with with the baby. For good luck." she added. 
The traditional ceremony wasn't the first of its kind celebrating Markle's pregnancy. Earlier last week, close members of Meghan's girl gang, A-listers Serena Williams and Amal Clooney decided to bring in celebrations by throwing her a $270,000 baby shower and made quite the headlines. The grand affair included everything from a flower arranging lesson to a dessert table prepared by The Mark Hotel's head chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, where her baby shower was organised. 
As far the Royal family and baby celebrations are concerned, Meghan isn't the first to get mehandi done on her hand. Kate Middleton, who was pregnant with Prince Louis last year also received a henna tattoo as a special gesture while on a royal visit to Sunderland. 
As the world watches out for news of the royal baby's arrival, we wish the Duchess of Sussex well and hope this tattoo brings her all the luck.

The Jonas Brothers are back with a music video featuring Priyanka Chopra, Sophie Turner and Danielle Jonas, and you can't miss it 
The Jonas Brothers are officially back with new music. A few days after announcing their reunion, the band—composed of Nick, Joe and Kevin Jonas—dropped their new single “Sucker”, along with a music video. The song marks the trio's first song in six years, and the brothers marked the big comeback by starring in the video with their respective leading ladies—Priyanka Chopra, Sophie Turner and Danielle Jonas. Since Nick Jonas married Priyanka Chopra in a star-studded ceremony in December last year, the love lives of the brothers have been in the spotlight. Kevin, the oldest, married his wife Danielle in 2009, and Joe proposed to his Game of Thrones actor fiancée Sophie in 2017. 
In the upbeat song, the brothers describe their love for their respective ladies. In the chorus they sing, “I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things going on no one knows about you (about you),” and “I'm a sucker for you/Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly/Any road you take you know that you'll find me." 
The video depicts the group in stylish Alice in Wonderland-themed ensembles as they dance, eat, drink and celebrate in a lavish mansion. The brothers are seen performing the track with their instruments—Joe is seen in an all-black look, Nick wears red pants and a vest, and Kevin sports a red and black sequin suit. The three women, or #JSisters as they call themselves, are in bright colourful outfits as well, including hats, headscarfs, large jewellery and fluffy dresses. 
In standout moments from the beginning of the video, Danielle is seen walking dogs in a pink dress and gloves, Priyanka is walking with large pruning shears, and Sophie is barking instructions from a pink ladder. The family is then seen enjoying a picnic on the lawns, as well as an opulent dinner inside the house. They then spend time eating and drinking in a tub outside, with Sophie spitting her drink back into the water in one hilarious scene. Towards the end, Kevin and Nick wear red fencing masks and duel, while Joe is tied up shirtless as Sophie watches. Each couple has romantic moments dancing with each other throughout the video. At the very end, the Jonases and their partners pose for an artist as he paints their portrait. 
The three brothers shared the news of their comeback just hours before, and Priyanka was among the first to repost the single cover. "And yes they're back…and may I say… hotter than ever. So proud of the family #Sucker #JonasBrothers#MidnightET," she said. 
The next day, she also posted a clip of the video as the Jonas Brothers' shared it on their social channels, and exclaimed her excitement and thoughts about working together with her new family for the first time. #SuckerVideo OUT NOW 🍭🍭 This is the first time we've worked together but not for a moment did it feel like work. Such a fun family affair…#JonasBrothers and the #JSisters cheering each other on! Proud of you husband," she said. 
Danielle Jonas put rumours of a rift with Chopra at rest as she posted a clip of the three #JSisters dancing together in the video. 
Cue the nostalgia, because this marks the return of the popular teen group, and is leaving diehard fans super excited. The trio released their last album in 2013, after which the band split to focus on their own endeavours. In the time since, Nick launched a successful solo career, releasing hit singles like Jealous and Close and got married to Chopra in December 2018. Joe formed a funk-pop band DNCE (cue: Cake by the Ocean) and got engaged to Turner in October 2017. Kevin has been working in real estate since, and has two daughters with his wife Danielle. In addition to their new single, the band is also set to make a week-long appearance on The Late Late Show With James Corden.

We round up the highs, the lows and the most talked about (and meme-d about) moments from the 2019 Academy Awards 
Last month, Tracee Ellis Ross and Kumail Nanjiani announced the nominees for the 91st edition of The Academy Awards, which took place on Sunday, February 24, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Following a groundbreaking year for the industry, which saw Hollywood attendees calling for better representation and a change in the industry's attitude to women with the Time's Up campaign on both the red carpet and the acceptance speeches, this time's award ceremony saw a focus on the political, with calls to action against the current president being a common trope in acceptance speeches. Green Book, a film about a black musician and his white chauffeur driving through the segregated South bagged Best Picture; Bohemian Rhapsody won big with four awards, while Roma and Black Panther received three awards apiece. Scroll ahead for the most memorable moments from the 2019 Academy Awards. 
The surviving members of the classic rock band Queen were joined by Adam Lambert as they performed their hit numbers, ‘We Will Rock You' and ‘We Are The Champions', to open the 91st Academy Awards. The performance was in honour of the late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, as his biopic Bohemian Rhapsody won four trophies at the show, including Rami Malek for Best Actor. The star-studded audience was seen enjoying the performance, and going by the shares and retweets, fans particularly loved the close-ups of Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez rocking out to the songs. 
The three actors referenced Donald Trump, the infamous Fyre Festival and the lack of anchors at this year's awards in a monologue at the start of the show. Kevin Hart was initially pegged as the host for the evening, but he pulled out due to controversial comments he made about race in the past. “We're not your hosts, but we'll stand here a little too long so the people who look at USA Today tomorrow will think that we hosted,” said Fey, as the trio presented an award for best supporting actress (which went to Regina King for her work in If Beale Street Could Talk). 
Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Henry showed off their own ‘best costumes' as they announced the winner of Best Costume Design this year. They wore a medley of some of the costumes from the films nominated in the category—The Favourite, Black Panther and Mary Queen of Scots. McCarthy sported a gown with stuffed animals on it, attached to a long train and rabbit puppet, while Henry wore a cape, hat and mask on his ensemble. 
Lady Gaga has been having a busy awards season—after winning a Golden Globe and two Grammys for her song ‘Shallow', she took home best original song at the Academy Awards as well. Gaga tearfully accepted the award and thanked her A Star is Born co-star Bradley Cooper. “There's not a single person on the planet who could have sang this song with me but you,” she said. The two received a standing ovation for their performance, as they sang a stripped down version of the winning song while sitting at a piano and gazing into each other's eyes—giving fuel to fans who are rooting for the two to have an off-screen romance as well. 
Period. End of Sentence. won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. The film depicts the taboos surrounding menstruation in rural India and the work of the Pad Project, started by a group of teenagers who produce affordable and accessible sanitary pads. “I can't believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar. A period should end a sentence, not a girl's education,” said executive producer, Guneet Monga. 
After five Oscars snubs in the past, Spike Lee finally won Best Adapted Screenplay for BlacKkKlansman, making it his first Academy Awards win. Samuel L Jackson presented Lee the award, and the Oldboy actor jumped into his friends's arms when he got on stage. He started his acceptance speech by telling producers not to start the clock on his speech, and then proceeded to read a two-page letter about the US' complicated racial history. He ended on a political note, saying, “The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let's all mobilise. Let's all be on the right side of history, make the moral choice between love versus hate.”

Considering that Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas first met at an Oscars party in 2017, this occasion was clearly a momentous one for the couple and their fans. See the sweet moments from the party now 
Two years after meeting at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in 2017 for the very first time, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' relationship came full circle with their attendance at the Oscars 2019 after-party on Sunday night (Pacific Time). The event was held at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Los Angeles, and the newly-weds stunned in their finest couture as they posed for the paparazzi—with Chopra sticking out her tongue at Jonas as he grinned back at her. 
The actor picked out a black Elie Saab Couture halter neck gown featuring a plunging neckline and intricate floral sequinned work for the night out, with Jonas complementing her in a navy blue suit and a black bow-tie. Priyanka Chopra looked to a pair of Chopard earrings to accentuate her look, while Jonas opted for a brooch pin by the same label. Beauty wise, Chopra opted for luminous makeup that matched her sartorial game—her eyes were highlighted with shimmering black eyeshadow and a generous use of mascara, a glossy dusty rose lip colour graced her pout, and a soft chignon with loose tendrils framing the face made up her hairstyle. 
The duo was joined by their family members, Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, who made an appearance at the Oscars 2019 after-party as well, making it a successful double date night. In case you missed it, the two made an adorable pair at the party with their PDA, including the time Priyanka Chopra took a moment to fix Jonas' hair, before he leaned in to kiss her on the neck, and when the two stuck their tongues out at each other on the red carpet.

The necklace has a hundred-year history behind it, but has only been worn by three women till date 
Even as the record-breaking success of A Star is Born has elevated Lady Gaga from pop superstar to serious thespian, the multitalented performer has never lost her sense of fun. Her arrival on the red carpet at the Hollywood and Highland Center was among the most anticipated tonight, and she delivered a look that was quintessentially her. After wearing everything from custom Celine to Valentino Couture during awards season the choice of a stately Alexander McQueen was a welcome surprise that reflected both her love of risk-taking fashion—she's repeatedly listed Lee Alexander McQueen as her favourite designer—and her status as a double nominee. 
Never one to choose a basic black dress, Gaga opted for a dramatic new red carpet silhouette. With its sculptural padded hips and lengthy train, the Sarah Burton design was an ultra-feminine choice with an editorial update that kept things exciting. By accentuating an area of the body many dresses merely glide over, the dress offered a sexy and fashion-forward twist on the traditional Oscar gown. 
Gaga scored the ultimate accessory to complete the look: a Tiffany diamond whose legendary fancy yellow stone was first discovered in 1877 and has led a storied life since. The diamond was displayed at the 1983 World's Fair, used in the promotional materials for Breakfast at Tiffany's, and featured in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris during the mid-nineties. Despite its hundred-year history, the diamond has only been worn by three women: socialite Mrs. Mary Whitehouse, Audrey Hepburn, and now Lady Gaga. 
Valued at more than 30 million dollars, the necklace featuring the stone and 100 more carats of white diamonds added the perfect final touch to Gaga's look. Whether or not the famous gems serve as a good luck charm remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Gaga pulled off a movie star moment for the ages.

Inside their big win at the 91st Academy Awards 
Priyanka Chopra is not the reason India was trending at the Oscars this year. Nominated in the Best Documentary Short category was the film Period. End of Sentence, which tackles the taboo around menstruation in India. Indian films have been nominated by the Academy in the past, but wins are few and far between. However, this wasn't the case with the nomination this year, as Period. End of a Sentence. did in fact take home an Oscar. 
Directed by Rayka Zehtabchi and co-produced by Melissa Berton and Mandakini Kakar, the film traces how a high school in Northern Hollywood raised funds to send a manual pad-making machine and a year's worth of supplies to women in Hapur, Uttar Pradesh. The film, which is also available on Netflix, talks about the various stigmas associated with mensuration, the absolute lack of sanitation for women in rural areas, and the variety of superstitions adding an unnecessary layer of impediment for women who are at a disadvantage on account of biology. The film also touches upon the work of the real ‘Pad Man', Arunachalam Muruganantham. 
Mandakini Kakkar proudly walked the red carpet for the 91st Academy Awards in a sari representing both the Indian drape and contemporary Indian design talent. Designer Gaurav Jai Gupta of Akaaro picked one of his signature metallic silk saris to dress her for the momentous occasion. “Kakar will be wearing our handwoven liquid molten metallic silver sari along with a handwoven silk satin graduating pattern jacket. We wanted to go with something which brings out the sharpness and strength in her. I found her to be very focused and simple, someone who is immersed in her work completely. Our silver metallic is a derivate of stainless steel and is modern and sharp. We resonated with the core values of the film and are truly appreciative at this opportunity,” he spoke a few days before the Oscars took place. 
Guneet Monga, the film's executive producer, was elated at the win as well. “Periods are normal and in no way do they stops us from achieving anything. This has been more than 10 years of work by Action India, run by Gauri Chaudhary, on educating reproductive rights on the ground in many villages. Feminist Majority Movement and Girls Learn International have been pushing this cause in US. Every girl in India or anywhere around the world needs to know this and hear this loud and clear. Period is an end of a sentence, but not a girl's eduction. 
“I am honoured and absolutely humbled to have partnered with Melissa and Rayka to make our short documentary happen. Mandakini Kakar from Sikhya was on the floor working with the film and is the voice of the film too. Now that we have an Oscar, let's go change the world,” she said. 
While the team was reeling from the big win, the excited crew was happy to share key moments from their journey at the Oscars. Scroll through our gallery to see more.

The 91st annual Academy Awards are upon us! See what the nominees and Hollywood’s A-list are wearing on the biggest red carpet of the 2019 awards season 
Hollywood's biggest stars turned out for the biggest (and last) red carpet of the 2019 awards season, with the likes of Charlize Theron, Marie Kondo and Ashley Graham turning out for this year's Academy Awards. 
A-listers descended upon Hollywood's Dolby Theater on Sunday, February 24, 2019 (Monday, February 25 in Australia) to celebrate a year of cinematic achievement. But let's be real, the show itself, while exciting, doesn't compare to the fun of the red carpet. 
It's one of the most iconic red carpets there is (maybe only matched by the Met Gala) and is a show that's just as much about fashion as the stars lucky enough to be wearing the magical creations we've seen today. 
All eyes were on Lady Gaga in black Alexander McQueen and Tiffany & Co. diamonds—a surefire nominee for best dressed of the night. Other highlights include Emma Stone in Louis Vuitton, Gemma Chan in Maison Valentino and Regina King in Oscar de la Renta, all nominees in 2019.

A year after Sridevi’s untimely demise, daughter Janhvi Kapoor and other Bollywood celebrities take to social media to mourn her first death anniversary 
To all who knew her and all who didn't, Sridevi was a larger-than-life figure—tall, statuesque, and a gifted actor who tugged at millions of heartstrings with her performances. Owing to a filmography of almost 300 movies spanning at least five different languages, Sridevi was rightfully touted as Bollywood's first female superstar—a box-office magnet from 1970s to 1990s. Naturally, along the way, she received almost every award the industry had to offer. 
On February 24, 2018, an ordinary morning brought sad news for not just the film industry, but the entire nation as well, as millions of fans and well-wishers world over woke up to news of Sridevi's  untimely death in Dubai, where she was attending a wedding. Today, a year after her tragic passing, the late actor's absence continues to felt by family, friends and fans alike. 
On the eve of Sridevi's first death anniversary, daughter Janhvi Kapoor took to Instagram to post a monochromatic picture of two pairs of hands, where the young actor appears to be sitting on her mother's lap, with a heartwarming caption. “My heart will always be heavy. But I'll always be smiling because it has you in it,” she wrote. Cousins Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Mohit Marwah, along Karan Johar, Manish Malhotra and Malaika Arora, among others, commented on the post soon after to share their love and condolences. 
Twitter saw fans and celebrities taking to the social media platform to mourn the late actor as well. Shabana Azmi put up a post early today morning, saying “A year already .. #Sridevi . You will live on through your work”, while veteran actor Anupam Kher shared a tweet reading, “Remembering Sridevi: It'll Never Ever Register She is not There.” Fans have also been re-circulating a tribute video that Boney Kapoor shared on Sridevi's Twitter account in June 2018 to commemorate what would have been their 22nd wedding anniversary. 
Ahead of Sridevi's death anniversary, English Vinglish director, Gauri Shinde, spoke to Vogue about life after the actor. “Sridevi not being in my life made me question my profession itself. What affects me is not that I lost a friend, but the loss of an artist.” In another chat, Manish Malhotra, a long-time collaborator and close friend to Sridevi, also said, “Sridevi's loss has been the first death that I have seen so close and it shook me. It has taken me months to get over it. For months she would come in my dreams. I still can't believe it and already a year has passed. I miss her—I miss her voice, I miss her calls. I miss chatting, catching up, discussing films and clothes, both things that we love. She was, is, and will always remain the most special to me. Her death truly taught me that nothing is permanent in life and that every moment must be lived to the fullest.” 
The Kapoor family had held a special puja at Sridevi's Chennai home on the late actor's Hindu death anniversary on February 14, 2019, which saw Anil Kapoor and other family members in attendance.

From the venue and time to the nominations and where you can watch it in India, here’s a quick refresher on the Oscars, Hollywood’s most sought-after awards night 
For film aficionados across the world, the Oscars remain the most eagerly awaited event on Hollywood's award season calendar. 2019, which marks the event's 91st edition, will be no different. 
Ever since its inception, the Oscars or the Academy Awards (a set of 24 awards presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences or AMPAS, honouring artistic and technical accomplishments in film releases from the previous calendar year) have been largely regarded as one of the highest honours one can receive in their film career. The first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16, 1929 at a private dinner function at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people. 
The validation and celebration of cinema aside, the ceremony itself is one that is closely followed. Last year, it came under criticism over diversity and inclusion, which led to #OscarsSoWhite trending on social media. Frances McDormand's Best Actress acceptance speech for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri also touched on the topic of diversity and demanded inclusion riders in all contracts while asking women at the ceremony to stand with her. And then there was the Best Picture mix-up between Moonlight and La La Land in 2017, caused by presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. 
The Oscars are also considered as the Olympics of fashion, and in light of the current mood, the 2018 red carpet was also used as a platform to make a statement about the Time's Up movement. Sandra Bullock and Octavia Spencer carried clutch bags with the Time's Up badges pinned on them while Emma Watson had Time's Up tattooed onto her forearm. 
The Oscars ceremony will be held on February 24, 2019 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The venue has played host to the event since 2002. 
The Oscars generally hosts about 3,400 attendees, and 26.5 million viewers watched it last year. 
Kevin Hart was initially announced as the host for the 2019 Oscars, and he went on to comment that he was, “blown away simply because this has been a goal on my list for a long time.” However, Hart stepped down three days after the announcement following the resurfacing of homophobic tweets from his Twitter account from 2009-2011. “I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year's Oscars. This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists,” he said. 
The successor for Jimmy Kimmel, who hosted both the 2017 and 2018 Academy Awards, has not been announced, and it seems like this will be the second hostless show in the event's history. The different segments will continue to be presided by presenters, though, as usual. The list of presenters this year includes Mike Myers, Queen Latifah, Serena Williams, Chadwick Boseman and Emilia Clarke. 
This year's nominations were announced on Tuesday, 22 January 2019 with a televised press conference at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theatre in Beverly Hills. Roma and The Favourite both bagged 10 nominations each in the major categories. They are up for Best Picture, alongside Green Book, Vice, A Star Is Born, Blackkklansman, Black Panther and Bohemian Rhapsody. Olivia Colman (for The Favourite), Lady Gaga (for A Star Is Born), Melissa McCarthy (for Can You Ever Forgive Me?), Glenn Close (for The Wife) and Yalitza Aparicio (for Roma) have been nominated for Best Actress. In fact, Lady Gaga's nomination for Best Actress and Song has made her the second woman to be nominated for both in the event's 91-year history. Christian Bale (for Vice), Bradley Cooper (for A Star Is Born), Willem Dafoe (for At Eternity's Gate), Rami Malek (for Bohemian Rhapsody) and Viggo Mortensen (for Green Book) are in the running for Best Actor. 
Indian documentary, Period. End of Sentence.—a short film based on Arunachalam Muruganantham, also the inspiration behind Akshay Kumar starrer Pad Man—has been nominated in the short subject documentary category. 
As per tradition, the nominees for Best Original Song will perform at the event. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga will reunite to perform Shallow from A Star Is Born. Some of the other performers include Jennifer Hudson singing I'll Fight from RBG and Bette Midler performing The Place Where Lost Things Go from Mary Poppins Returns. 
The actor, who attended the Academy Awards in 2016 and 2017, had to give it a miss due to her ill health last year. The newly-married star recently revealed how husband Nick Jonas had gone down on one knee at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party in 2017 to say to her: “You're real. Where have you been all my life?” Hence it is no surprise that fans of the couple are rooting for the duo to make a joint appearance on the red carpet this year. 
In India, Hollywood and fashion enthusiasts often set their alarms early to catch the awards live. In India, the red carpet will start at 5.30am on Monday, February 25, with the ceremony starting at 7am IST. Stream the show online on Hotstar on Monday morning.

They are as outrageously luxurious as you'd have guessed 
As one of the world's biggest and most publicised award ceremonies, attended by the film industry's most prolific names, the Academy Awards have become synonymous with the kind of glamour that is rivalled by no other. As such, it should come as no surprise that the gift bags handed out at the event are just as luxe. 
While only a handful of nominees will be presented with a golden statuette come February 24 in the US (February 25 in Australia), each and every one will walk away with a gift bag that Forbes is reporting to be worth US$100,000 (that's AU$139,665). 
With everything from luxurious holidays, and expensive jewels, to high-class products and VIP memberships on offer, we'd go as far as to say that the gift bag alone is motivation enough for a nomination. 
As the goodie bags themselves are not officially handed out by The Academy, for the 17th consecutive year, it is in fact Los Angeles-based marketing agency Distinctive Assets that has pulled together the goods for the ceremony's rather OTT party favours. 
Along with your choice of a trip to Iceland, the Galapago, the Amazon or Costa Rica and Panama, as cannabis has now been legalised in California, the 2019 gift bag also boasts a selection of marijuana-infused products. For the full list of giveaways, be sure to read on below. Inside the nominee gift bag: 
A International Expeditions shall-ship trip to either Iceland, the Galapagos, the Amazon, Costa Rica and Panama Yeti Cooler filled with Jarritos and a donation of the soft drink to a charitable event of choice Private therapy sessions with phobia relief specialist Kalliope Barlis A MOTA Los Angeles membership and access for an additional three guests Premium A.

Recently spotted on Kareena Kapoor Khan’s talk show What Women Want, Malaika Arora spoke about how her family supported her through her divorce, and how she believes that a child should grow in a happy environment. 
After years in the industry, Bollywood actor, dancer and television presenter Malaika Arora is a household name in India. Most recently, the star is taking over trending charts in the country for her conversation with long-time friend Kareena Kapoor Khan on the latter's radio talk show, 'What Women Want'. In case you haven't been tracking the Ishq FM show, Kapoor Khan has been chatting about women's issues with some of her favourite people, and past episodes have included the likes of Soha Ali Khan Pataudi, Amrita Arora Ladak, Sunny Leone and Manish Malhotra, all of whom have had eye-opening chats with the actor about their lives. Malaika Arora's new episode on the show had her talking not just about parenting in the modern world, but also about her recent divorce with Arbaaz Khan after 19 years of marriage. "Yeh woh word hai jo aaj bhi hum dinner table par discuss karne se darte hai," Kapoor Khan said in her introduction. After keeping the reasons behind her divorce to herself for close to two years, Arora finally broken her silence over the split and how she really felt about it. 
“We were just two people in a situation where we were making each other extremely unhappy” she said, further adding “which was impacting everyone else's life around us.” When asked for the best advice that she received upon arriving at the decision of ending her marriage, Arora responded saying, “If this is the decision that you're making, then we are really proud of you and in our eyes you are a really strong woman... this is what gave me the extra strength that I needed.” Arora also shared advice for women who are unhappy in their own marriages: “Don't let anybody bring you down or tell you that you are any less of a person or a woman, just make sure that you're a strong, wonderful woman.” 
During her chat with Kareena Kapoor Khan, Malaika Arora also spoke out about the stigma attached with divorce. “A woman getting looks upon getting divorced is bound to happen, ki, ‘Oh God, she's a girl that you know…who got divorced or whatever.' That is like the biggest disparity that there is amongst the many other disparities that you have to deal with.” 
Khan also touched upon the topic of finding love after divorce, and Arora's response was all about positivity. “I think all women should jump back into it with equal gusto," she said. "Have fun, enjoy it. I think for the first time in your life, you'll also kind of discover a sense of freedom.” 
In case you missed the episode, now's your chance to catch up.

The shower featured both a flower-arranging lesson and a dessert tasting experience and the bonbonnieres were luxury suitcases 
If you have ever wondered what a royal baby shower looks like then we have some insights for you. Better yet, if you're wondering what a royal baby shower costs then we have that covered too. The answer? Apparently it costs USD$200,000 (or $277,000) to throw a duchess-approved baby shower. 
In case you missed it, Meghan Markle is currently in New York to celebrate the impending birth of her baby with her closest friends. The Duchess of Sussex is said to have arrived at The Mark Hotel in New York last Friday in top secret fashion, with the soon-to-be mother hosting a number of small get togethers with friends in the past few days before the official baby shower which took place on Wednesday. 
The shower, which was also at The Mark, is said to have been organised by Serena Williams with the help of Amal Clooney and Vanity Fair is reporting the party cost approximately $277,000. The Upper East Side affair took place in the luxury hotel's Penthouse Suite, which in itself costs $100,000 per night and is the largest penthouse in the United States. When you add in the cost of Markle's transport to the US—a private jet costing $140,000—the shower has already clocked up $240,000. 
Then there's the royal-worthy baby shower games. According to Vanity Fair's royal expert Katie Nicholl, guests at Markle's baby shower enjoyed “a flower arranging lesson accompanied by a dessert table prepared by the restaurant's head chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who will be there to greet them.” Considering Vongerichten has two Michelin stars for his restaurant, that is some really good dessert that the celebrity-filled guest list were snacking on. If they weren't content with that they also had access to some fairy floss it seems, after a cotton candy machine was seen arriving at The Mark Hotel too. In addition, E! News is calculating the flower arrangements—which are made from out-of-season peonies—at $7300. 
Aside from organisers Serena Williams and Amal Clooney, other guests at the baby shower included Priyanka Chopra, designer Misha Nonoo, Markle's best friend and former stylist Jessica Mulroney, her college friend Lindsay Roth, one of her oldest friends Benita Litt, TV personality (and Oprah's BFF) Gayle King and her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer. Also seen arriving at The Mark was Markle's hair stylist Serge Normant, her make-up artist Daniel Martin, Pilates instructor Taryn Toomey and the man who is said to have helped organise her first date with Prince Harry, Markus Anderson. 
As for what is the appropriate party favour for a royal-approved guest list full of celebrities? Luxury suitcases of course. More than a dozen suitcases by the luggage label Away were being seen wheeled into The Mark, which cost approximately $350 each. 
In a baby shower fit for a duchess we hope that the royal's choice of venue is a nod to what we hope is a potential secret moniker. Given her surname, do you think Meghan's nickname is The Mark?

The biggest night in Hollywood, the Oscars are set to take place this weekend, and the night will bring with it a stunning array of looks on the red carpet. Here, we predict the designer looks we're likely to spot on the celebrities during Oscar 2019 
The Oscars roll into LA on Sunday 24 February, putting an end to months of speculation as to who will scoop the coveted gongs. Tough call when the nominees for Leading Actress alone comprise Yalitza Aparicio, Glenn Close, Olivia Colman, Lady Gaga and Melissa McCarthy. With the fashion world heavily invested in the evening's red carpet proceedings, the pontificating extends far beyond Tinseltown. Each year, the Academy Awards draw a global audience hungry to play witness and jury to the world's best dresses, many of which are, as I type, being personally couriered into LAX from European ateliers by patient PR reps sworn to absolute secrecy. But then these diligent modes of delivery ultimately pay dividends in brand exposure. 26.5 million viewers tuned in to the 2018 Oscars, making this the high fashion equivalent of Super Bowl Sunday, and that's not even taking account of the millions of regrams and memes a single paparazzi shot now has the power to generate. While the world's biggest fashion houses gear up to unveil their Oscars contenders, we're taking a moment to daydream about the gowns that just might rule the red carpet at this year's ceremony. 
When it comes to the most flattering, flashbulb-ready gowns, floor-length metallic styles will always win the day. This year's updates? Elegant capped shoulders courtesy of Givenchy and burnished pleats (brought to you by Gucci and Dior). 
[#image: /photos/5ce4151db40d26c35ed6ad03]||| ||| Gucci. Image: Harmony Korine 
We're predicting Lady Gaga's exuberant red carpet style run is going to inspire other actors to take a risk at this year's Oscars. Cue an eye-popping colour palette (Valentino couture has it covered) and renewed confidence in exaggerated (rather than second-skin) silhouettes. 
[#image: /photos/5ce4151ccc50be1e8413d7fe]||| ||| Alexis Mabille. Image: Getty 
Our guess is that there will be more than a few actors showcasing a new spin on the old Hollywood favourite at this year's Academy Awards: the feather-trimmed gown. The nominees? Oscar de la Renta's for that sweetheart neckline from spring/summer 2019, and the sweeping lengths of Ralph & Russo and Giambattista Valli couture. 
[#image: /photos/5ce4151d3bf9b4f76db1aba8]||| ||| Oscar De La Renta. Image: Getty 
While we've noted a shift away from the red carpet's “naked” dress trend circa 2014, demure sheers are now coming into their own. No one reveals just a hint of the bare skin beneath the fabric quite like Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior. 
[#image: /photos/5ce4151e9cc0c00d25f9b78e]||| ||| Givenchy. Image: Getty 
Red carpet crash course: the simplest dresses, when beautifully executed, are capable of causing a sensation. Schiaparelli, Chanel and Armani Privé couture boast the kind of strapless cuts that dreams are made of (cast your mind back to Winona Ryder wearing Trigère, Oscars 1990) and nowhere does a classic, faultless black cocktail gown feel more at home than on the Oscars red carpet. 
[#image: /photos/5ce4151fb40d265cdad6ad05]||| ||| Giorgio Armani Prive. Image: Getty 
Plot twist: designers Brandon Maxwell, Ralph & Russo and Elie Saab have reinterpreted the one-shoulder column gown for spring/summer 2019, recasting the red carpet staple in sugary shades. The main feature? A scattering of glimmering embellishment.

In a recent interview, Alia Bhatt opened up about her relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, rumours about their split, and all the speculations around her wedding date. 
Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are without a doubt, one of Bollywood's most-talked-about couples right now. It was back in May 2018 that Kapoor first broke the silence on his relationship with Bhatt, saying “It's really new right now, and I don't want to over speak. It needs time to breathe and it needs space.” And almost a year later, rumours surrounding the duo continue to take over the internet every once in a while. One of the most recent ones stemmed from a picture that hit the internet in November 2018, where a frowning Alia Bhatt was seen sitting next to Ranbir Kapoor.

A post shared by ¦ Rαńbir ✖ liα ¦ ❤💍 (@ranbiraliafc) on Nov 16, 2018 at 9:01pm PST 
After months of being tight-lipped, Bhatt recently decided to respond to the new rumours surrounding her relationship with Kapoor in a recent interview with DNA. “Honestly, at first when people started claiming I was crying, I found it funny. It's a joke on my sets and with those who are closest to me,” she revealed. “Anybody who looks at my face tells me, ‘Alia, why are you looking so sad? Please cheer up'. I tend to zone out a lot. But only a few people will know that this is my usual face, when I'm focused or thinking about something. So, I just can't believe that my frown has become a sensation and a new story is being cooked up every day about how I'm sad. It's not true. I don't find the need to clarify it because in my heart, if I know what the truth is, nothing else really matters.” 
In case you missed it, Alia Bhatt also used her recent interview to talk about all the speculation surrounding her wedding. “I don't understand the need for everyone to discuss this [my wedding] all the time. But then, I think to myself that it's a simple question and my answer remains the same. If I'm not getting married right now, that's what I'll say. I'm happy being in a relationship, but that doesn't mean I'm tying the knot just yet. I'm too young to think about it. When I feel there's a need to be in a stronger bond with him, we will come to it. But right now, I'm married to my work and I also have my relationship going well on the side.” 
On the work front, Bhatt is currently celebrating the success of her latest project, Gully Boy, which also stars Ranveer Singh. The actor has two more movies lined up: period drama Kalank (which includes Madhuri Dixit Nene, Sonakshi Sinha, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanjay Dutt), and Brahmastra, in which Bhatt's fans will see her working with Ranbir Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan. Can't wait for more updates on the couple? Here's a peek at some of Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor's sweetest moments together so far.

Deepika Padukone just posted a snapshot with her mother Ujjala Padukone, and it's adorable 
Scroll through Deepika Padukone's Instagram and while you'll see her often sharing pictures from her work sphere, she likes to keep personal moments, especially with family, private. Recently though, the actor gave fans a peek at her candid side when she shared pictures of her indulging in goofy moments with mother, Ujjala Padukone. Looking her happiest, the post read, “trying to get her to smile...but she's such a natural...❤️ #motheranddaughter”. 
The star who tied the knot with beau Ranveer Singh in November last year, celebrated their first Valentine's Day as a married couple on February 14, 2019. But the duo spent the day in a slightly different way than the usual plans most couples indulge in. Ace badminton player Prakash Padukone was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Sportstar Aces awards, which took place on Valentine's Day, and was attended by the entire family. And while Deepika's presence was not unexpected, a doting Ranveer Singh, whose recent feature Gully Boy also released the same day, was also spotted at the awards ceremony in support of his father-in-law. 
If you remember, Deepika Padukone shed a tear at the Sportstar Aces awards last year when she read a letter addressed to her by her father, and this year was no different. The actor had an emotional moment as Prakash Padukone was called on stage for his felicitation. The night also got the people to see the newly-married couple along with Padukone's parents, in one frame on stage. 
For the evening, the star chose a stunning backless gown in an orange hue that she paired with statement floral earrings, paired with a messy hairdo. Ranveer Singh is known for his funny (and often suggestive) quips on her pictures, and was spotted in her comments section with, “Tasty Fingers” on one of the posts, “Purrrrrrrrrrrr” on the second post and lastly “Maar hi dogi Tum ...” on the third post. Scroll down to have a look at what she wore in case you missed it. 
On the work front, the star has begun working on her debut production Chhapak where she will be seen playing the role of an acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal. Singh, on the other hand, is celebrating the success of his latest film Gully Boy, which has received a brilliant response.

After Janhvi Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor is the latest from the clan to enter Bollywood, but will make her debut not as an actor, but behind the camera 
Making a film is no easy feat, a lot goes on behind the scenes to bring the characters on screen to life and making them look the part involves the hard work of a tireless crew. After Janhvi Kapoor, a new Kapoor kid is joining the Bollywood ranks, but from behind the scenes. Carrying the family legacy forward is Shanaya Kapoor, Sanjay and Maheep Kapoor's eldest daughter, and Anil Kapoor's niece. 
The proud parents took to Instagram yesterday to reveal that Shanaya has started work on a new film as an assistant director, and her very first assignment has taken her to Lucknow. 
Maheep posted a throwback picture of Shanaya and with her father and captioned it, “My baby's gone to Lucknow for 2 weeks 🙁#MissYouAlready#AssistantDirectorsLife #LoveYou ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🧿 @shanayakapoor02 #ProudMama❤️” while Sanjay chose to express his love through a separate Instagram post with a picture of him and his daughter wishing her luck “All the best Shanaya ❤️#newbeginnings #newjourney” 
Even though the details of the upcoming film have not been revealed yet, we're sure the project is going to be nothing short of a learning curve for this new Kapoor. This stepping stone for Shanaya comes at a time when her closest friends, Ananya Panday and Suhana Khan are also starting out in films. While Suhana apparently worked with her father on the mega-starrer film Zero, Ananya is on her way to her debut in Bollywood with Student Of The Year 2 which is expected to release in May this year. Ananya also made her first appearance on the Koffee with Karan couch along with co-stars Tara Sutaria and Tiger Shroff recently. 
Shanaya Kapoor is not the first to start out her career in Bollywood as an assistant director. Siblings Sonam Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor had also worked on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Black and Nikhil Advani's Kal Ho Naa Ho and Salaam-e-Ishq respectively, before making it out big with their acting debuts.

It's a party in the USA 
The Duchess of Sussex headed home to the USA for a last minute secret trip to see friends and attend her baby shower, People reports. 
The 37-year-old is due to give birth to her first child, who will be the seventh-in-line to the British throne, in April and with her due date fast approaching it appears the duchess is making the most of the last few weeks that she is able to travel. Most airlines won't allow pregnant women to fly without a medical certificate from a doctor asserting their fitness to travel after 28 weeks (seven months) and many won't allow pregnant women to fly at all from eight months. 
A source told People that Markle's friends had planned a baby shower for the duchess in New York, despite New York not being Markle's hometown. Markle is from Los Angeles, where her yoga-instructor mother Doria Ragland still lives, but since 2011 and before she moved to the UK to marry Prince Harry, the duchess had been based in Toronto, Canada where her show Suits was filmed. 
According to The Daily Mail, Markle flew from London to New York last Friday, February 15, and spent Saturday with her close friend and sometime stylist Jessica Mulroney at upscale French macaron heaven, Ladurée in SoHo. The publication reports the duchess's friends have planned to throw her a baby shower for 15 guests at “an undisclosed hotel on the Upper East Side” today. The duchess is reportedly then heading back to London tomorrow (Wednesday). 
As for who will attend the baby shower, what will go down (baby naming guessing games? Spin the ring to guess the baby's sex?) and what baby gifts will be given to Markle (what do you get a royal baby?) no answers to those questions as yet, but with stylist Jessica Mulroney involved it's certain to be a very chic affair, as befits a duchess. 
This trip is Markle's reportedly second last overseas trip before the baby is due, with the duchess and the duke heading to Morocco from February 23 until February 25 for an official three-day visit. Town & Country reports the trip will focus on two of the couple's main causes—girls' education and “youth empowerment”.

Princes Harry and William are reportedly splitting their households, which has led to speculation on how it’s going to affect their—and Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's—social media presence 
The Kensington Palace's official Instagram and Twitter pages have so far been the go-to for everything that the royal family was up to, be it the younger royals' visits to various countries or the various progressive and empowering speeches by Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle on various issues of social welfare. Even the news of their pregnancies were delivered to their fans through their social media handles, but we might soon be getting our scoop on the royals from two separate accounts. 
A change in the royal household is in order according to The Sunday Times, which in November reported that Prince William and Prince Harry would soon be splitting their households, giving both brothers their own separate staff and their own royal court. 
The news may seem as unexpected to some, but these changes have long been in order owing to Queen Elizabeth II's retirement plans and the royal family's will to offer a smooth transition of affairs to the remaining family, who will carry forward the monarchy and the various responsibilities and titles being held by them. 
Even though full details of the split have not been revealed yet, it is predicted that the transition will happen before the birth of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's child (which is due in April). Frogmore Cottage, which is set to be their official residence soon, is currently undergoing renovations taking care of the royal couple's needs, and will include things such as building an eco-friendly nursery for their baby, and a bespoke yoga studio. 
A source was quoted telling The Sunday Times, "William and Harry are working to make sure the Sussexes have an office that can support their family when they move to Frogmore this spring. This work has been under way since before last year's wedding." 
At the moment, the social media handles for the sections of the royal family are based on where they stay—Clarence House is for Prince Charles and his wife Camillia, and Kensington Palace is for the young royals, the Cambridges (Prince William and Kate Middleton) and the Sussexes (Prince Harry and Meghan Markle). And according to E! News, "the first major division of the joint royal household will be of their media team." With such transformations underway, it is understood that a single team managing the two households would prove to be a difficult situation. If the social media accounts do split, does that mean double the royal content? We'll be keeping our eyes peeled.

Rumour has it Priyanka Chopra may be pregnant with her first child. Get all the details on her and Nick Jonas' baby now 
2018 ended on a very romantic note for Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, who tied the knot in not one, but two gorgeous ceremonies in Jodhpur, India. After saying 'I do' with a white wedding, the duo celebrated their love with a Hindu wedding ceremony as well, before jet setting around the globe for a series of mini post-wedding getaways. 
Post sealing the deal, Chopra and husband Jonas have opened up about their relationship to their fans via interviews, and have even shared their parenting plans. “I definitely want to be a father someday,” Jonas revealed recently. “I think that's a real dream, and I think I've had to grow up pretty quick. With that, you could look at it two ways. You could say that was unfair or you could say it's given me some real perspective at an early age and I've seen a lot of life at an early age, and I hope to be able to share that with a kid of my own someday.” 
Now, rumour has it that Priyanka Chopra might be pregnant with her first child, but neither the star nor her family have shared any statements confirming the news as of yet. Although the couple hasn't officially spoken out on the topic, they have remained neutral to the rumours so far. In a recent interview, one of Chopra's close friends revealed that the actor was excited about her dreamy wedding in 2018, but motherhood is what she is most looking forward to in 2019. Back in February 2018, the star also said “marriage and kids are a big goal for me. I'm a big believer in the institution of marriage and in the family, and in kids, I want to have a lot of them, if God allows. The only problem is, I don't know who I'll do it with.” 
On the work front, Priyanka Chopra is currently celebrating the release of her Hollywood rom-com Isn't It Romantic, which also stars Rebel Wilson and Liam Hemsworth. The star will also soon appear in The Sky Is Pink alongside Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim. 
While the baby speculations continue to take over the internet, here's a peek at what the couple posted for each other on Valentine's Day.

The latest episode of Koffee with Karan sees Tara Sutaria reveal her crush on a Student of the Year alumni, Tiger Shroff field questions on Disha Patani, and Ananya Panday on the nepotism debate—all in their interview with Karan Johar. Here are some of the highlights 
Six years after Alia Bhatt shot to fame with her answer about the President of India that landed her in a bunch of memes, a new batch of students took on the (in)famous couch on Koffee with Karan season 6. Dressed in their Saturday best, Tiger Shroff escorted his co-stars from Student of the Year 2, Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday, on his arm. While Sutaria opted for a dazzling Nicole + Felicia number, the latter swept into the room in a blue MxS gown. Together with Shroff, they offered up a candid take on their journey into Bollywood under the guiding light of Bhatt's words of caution. “Just remember, if you don't know the answer, say nothing. Let the point go to someone else, just don't say anything,” she quipped in a tongue-in-cheek video montage played during the show. While the trio had brushed up on their general knowledge and correctly named the President of India, here are the trickier zingers by Johar that they faced on the couch. 
Despite being spotted with the petite actor on numerous occasions, from late night chemist runs to weekend brunch, the actor brushed off the speculation. "Walking out of the restaurant every Sunday holding the bag for her makes me look better," he quipped before clarifying, “We don't talk about it that much. I am great friends with her and I love her company. We are keeping it at that. We have similar interests and I don't have many friends in the industry. She is one of the few friends I have, and whom I'm comfortable with.” 
The perky 19-year-old's debut movie is yet to hit screens, but Panday had her homework done for her first time on the famous Koffee with Karan couch. "I have played rapid fire as a child. Suhana [Khan], Shanaya [Kapoor] and I have a WhatsApp group named ‘Charlie's Angels' and we discuss everything in that—who wears what and rapid fire with each other." 
Johar, who has a ringside view of the equation between the trio on the sets of their upcoming movie, conferred the title of Miss Braganza on Sutaria, with Panday providing further insight into her vast vocabulary. “She actually once said, ‘Now that the salutations and greetings have taken place'. Sometimes you are just chatting with friends and if I say, ‘Tiger and me are enjoying', she corrects me, ‘That's wrong. It is Tiger and I',” the young debutante revealed. 
Acknowledging her privilege, the starlet faced the nepotism rumours head-on. When quizzed by Johar about the people who feel she hasn't earned her place, she frankly admitted, "I agree with this section because I haven't done anything to be here. There are so many people out there who are talented. I am just lucky to have got this, and I am so grateful to you. I feel like I have to work even more harder now." 
Having started out in the industry as a VJ for Disney at the age of fifteen, Sutaria has since worked on finding her way into the inner circle. Despite her outsider cred, she revealed, "People have been welcoming. I am very reserved and shy at parties, but people have been very welcoming otherwise.” After dropping a hint that she had a crush on an ex-student, she admitted that she'd love to have coffee with her Marjaavan co-star, Sidharth Malhotra.

Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's PDA at Gully Boy's screening was too cute to miss. Did you spot the other Bollywood couple there too? 
Talk surrounding Gully Boy, which stars Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt, first started doing the rounds when the film's first look dropped on YouTube on January 9, 2019. Directed by Zoya Akhtar, the movie is all set to hit theatres today and last night, the cast and crew of the movie came together at Mumbai's PVR Juhu to watch the final edit together. In case you missed it, Gully Boy's world premiere took place just a few days ago at the 69th Berlinale International Film Festival at Friedrichstadt-Palast, Germany, and has been receiving lots of love and support online. 
For the Mumbai screening of Gully Boy, Ranveer Singh was joined by his parents Anju and Jagjit Singh Bhavnani, his sister Ritika Bhavnani and of course, wife Deepika Padukone too. Given the special occasion (and the fact that the screening took place on the eve of Valentine's Day), the beaming couple had all eyes on them as they left the venue together. Singh was spotted giving Padukone a little kiss on the cheek for the cameras too, and the pictures are too cute to miss out on.

This is how Deepika Padukone & Ranveer Singh brought in Valentine’s Day 
Post their picture-perfect Lake Como wedding, both Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have become more open with their fans about their relationship, and what their equation is really like. "I think when we started dating six years ago, professionally, we were both in very different places. My career took off slightly before his, but throughout our relationship, right from 2013—even when I was shooting for [Goliyon Ki Rasleela] Ram-Leela and Chennai Express—nothing has changed," Padukone revealed in December 2018. “I think you just know when you want to spend the rest of your life with that one person—and he's everything rolled into one man. He's my best friend, playmate, companion and confidant. I can be silly in front of him, I can be stupid in front of him, I can be sick in front of him, I can be whatever I want to be.” 
As it turns out, #DeepVeer wasn't the only celebrity couple spotted at Gully Boy's Mumbai screening. Singh's co-star Alia Bhatt was also in attendance, and was accompanied by beau Ranbir Kapoor. While Bhatt picked a yellow floral dress for the occasion, Kapoor complemented her look in jeans and a blue zip-up jacket with yellow detailing that matched her dress.

Bollywood icon Madhubala's 86th birthday was marked with a Google doodle today, with an illustration of the star as Anarkali in Mughal-e-Azam. On the occasion, we take a look back at the Vogue India shoot back from October 2017, in which Sonam Kapoor Ahuja brought to life the same character for our pages 
February 14, 2019 doesn't just mark Valentine's Day, it is also the 86th birth anniversary of the late actor Madhubala, who is still known and remembered for her unparalleled beauty, and her unforgettable role as Anarkali in Mughal-e-Azam. To celebrate the occasion, Google paid a sweet tribute to the actor by redesigning the Google doodle to a sketch of her from a scene from the epic historical drama, which shows Madhubala, born Mumtaz Jehan Begum Dehlavi, flashing her signature smile and dancing. 
Few know that it took filmmaker K Asif 10 years to shoot Mughal-e-Azam, which ultimately redefined the grandeur of Indian cinema. Madhubala played the role of a court dancer, Anarkali, and the story talks about the great love her character shared with Mughal Prince Salim. Director Feroz Abbas Khan recreated the film as a play in 2016 which was also accredited as India's first Broadway musical experience. Mughal-e-Azam, the play, took nine months to come to life and Khan confessed that it was his dream come true and perhaps his most appreciated project. What made the play even more exciting to watch were the Manish Malhotra costumes that were designed just for the performances. 
Madhubala was often compared to the late Hollywood actor Marilyn Monroe, and was even titled the ‘Marilyn Monroe of Bollywood'. She made her screen debut at the dotting age of nine in Basant. Before her untimely demise, the actor starred in close to 70 films, and one of the biggest highlights of her career was when she received a nomination for Filmfare's Best Actress Award for her performance in Mughal-e-Azam. 
Over the years, Madhubala hasn't just inspired actors with roles, she has also inspired one of Vogue India's most beautiful shots. Back in October 2017, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja took over the pages of Vogue India's anniversary issue in a shoot that had her transforming into a series of powerful women including Mata Hari, German actor Marlene Dietrech and artist Freida Kahlo. But one snapshot that can't be forgotten is the one where Kapoor Ahuja recreated Madhubala's hypnotic gaze as Anarkali in Mughal-e-Azam. Dressed in a pink Ritu Kumar ensemble, there's no missing Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's romantic vibe in this picture. What better way to pay tribute to one of the Indian film industry's most beautiful and talented performers?

Priyanka Chopra appeared on the spoof segment ‘Ew!’ of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and this is what happened 
If we saw a bunch of people dressing themselves in crazy school girl costumes we wouldn't be surprised because Priyanka Chopra just made them fashionable again. The star appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon's ‘Ew!' segment yesterday as playing schoolgirl Mia Singh, wearing a denim jumper over a white T-shirt. Completing her look were high pigtails with pink extensions and load of glitter eye shadow, but her look wasn't the best part of the segment. 
Having started her promotional rounds for upcoming film Isn't it Romantic right after the wedding, of course, Nick Jonas crops up in every interview she does. During the show, Jimmy Fallon—who plays a recurring character, Sara (without an 'h')—showed her pictures of various items and people to which Chopra had to respond with 'ew' or 'cute'. The last photo shown to her was of husband Nick Jonas, to which she first responded with ‘ew!' but gave it away when Jimmy responded with “Really?", and she giggled and added, “No, I'd totally put a ring on it.” 
The two were seen yesterday at the LA premiere of Isn't It Romantic, sharing some adorable moments on the pink carpet. The couple's social media too, is filled with PDA for each other. Jonas came out in full support of Chopra and shared a picture of them from the pink carpet on his Instagram captioned, “Proud of my beautiful and talented wife @priyankachopra , and the entire cast and crew of Isn't It Romantic. Everyone should go see this movie! @rebelwilson @andybovine@liamhemsworth @straussschulson”. 
Priyanka Chopra's latest Instagram post, in turn, reads, “Find someone who looks at you like that...😍 @nickjonas”

The guest list also included Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Hudson and Friends co-star Courteney Cox 
Jennifer Aniston's 50th birthday party, which took place at the Sunset Tower Hotel in Los Angeles on Saturday night, proved one for the ages. Attended by countless Hollywood names and a plethora of famous faces, the event made headlines when it was revealed that even Brad Pitt, the actress' ex-husband, made an appearance. 
Scouring the internet, we searched high and low for images inside the big bash, but alas, there weren't any. That is, until now. Thanks to the photo booth that Aniston had set up inside the party, a series of images have made their way onto Instagram, granting us a sneak peek inside the party we all would have loved an invite to. 
While we do know that George and Amal Clooney, Robert Downey Jr., Ellen DeGeneres, Demi Moore, Lisa Kudrow and John Mayer all turned up to help the Friends actress celebrate her 50th birthday, thus far, we've only caught a glimpse of what guests like Katy Perry, Reese Witherspoon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson got up to on the night. 
Taking to Instagram to wish Aniston a happy birthday, Paltrow posted a series of images featuring the two of them, together with a number of others including journalist Derek Blasberg, posing for the camera from inside the event. 
"Happy birthday (last night and tomorrow) to #jenniferaniston our ray of sunshine, example of perpetual goodness," the Goop founder wrote. "We love you so much and you make 50 LOOK [fire emoji]." 
Hudson also shared images from inside the 50th birthday party, with the caption: “Love these ladies. Celebrated this beauty last night Happy Bday JA! We all love you sooo!”

Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta, who got engaged last year, will tie the knot in March this year. Check out what the couple's wedding invite looks like here 
Just weeks after Isha Ambani tied the knot with Anand Piramal, the Ambani family is all set for another grand wedding. In case you missed it, Akash Ambani, the oldest son of Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani, celebrated his engagement with childhood sweetheart Shloka Mehta in June last year with a three-day ceremony in Mumbai. And now, the couple is all set to tie the knot in March this year. Yesterday, Mukesh, Nita and their younger son, Anant Ambani, paid a visit to Mumbai's Siddhivinayak temple to offer the first invitation to Akash and Shloka's wedding, thus beginning the wedding celebrations on a prosperous note. 
[#image: /photos/5ce414f4b40d26d951d6acc1]||| ||| Image: Viral Bhayani 
Akash and Shloka's wedding invites came in a beautiful red box featuring auspicious Indian motifs of horses and elephants painted along the sides. The box sat on a tray lined with pearls and flowers. From what we can see so far, the lid of the box which holds the invite has also been painted with a Hindu deity. The Ambanis clearly put a lot of thought into their invites. You may remember the invite for the couple's daughter Isha Ambani, which included a heartfelt note written by the bride dedicated to her and Anand Piramal's grandparents. 
For her trip to Siddhivinayak temple, Nita Ambani opted for a regal kurta set in shades of red and orange. The kurta, which featured a bandhni print, was topped off with a Benarasi dupatta. Instead of churidars, the mother of the groom wore her kurta with comfortable palazzo pants featuring gold embroidery around the ankles. 
[#image: /photos/5ce414f489be36beb07ce2f7]||| ||| Image: Viral Bhayani 
According to reports, Akash and Shloka's wedding date is fixed for March 9, 2019. The celebrations are to begin with the ‘mangal baraat' at the Trident Hotel in Mumbai at 3.30pm. The baraatis will then leave for the Jio World Centre in Bandra Kurla Complex from the hotel. The wedding ceremony is said to commence at 7.30pm at the venue, prior to which the families will have a high tea for their guests. 
On March 10, a ‘mangal parv' ceremony is said to take place that will be hosted by both the Ambanis and the Mehtas, and the wedding reception is rumoured to take place on March 11.  Though the guest list hasn't being revealed, it's safe to say that Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's wedding will be attended by some of the biggest names in Bollywood. Fun fact: Isha Ambani revealed to Vogue India recently that Akash was originally supposed to get married before her. "Akash has the largest heart ever. He changed his wedding dates for me. He got engaged to Shloka before Anand and me, but he was like, 'I'll get married afterwards, you take my wedding dates.' He's like one of the most—I don't think there's a word for it in English—“dayalu” humans in this world. He's empathetic, gracious and gentle, just like Shloka."

Priyanka Chopra and husband Nick Jonas were all loved up on the pink carpet for the LA premiere of 'Isn't It Romantic'. Check out their pictures from the night, and Jonas' Instagram message for her, here 
It's barely been two months since Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' fairy tale wedding (and their many mini post-wedding getaways), and Chopra has already dived straight into her work. On February 11, the newly-wed actor was seen at the world premiere of her upcoming movie Isn't it Romantic in Los Angeles at The Theatre at Ace Hotel, and given the title of the film, it comes as no surprise that Chopra was accompanied by husband Nick Jonas for the occasion. But if you've been thinking that this movie's yet another predictable rom-com, you're in for a surprise. Rumour has it that Isn't it Romantic, despite its name, comes under the list of of not-so-basic rom-coms. What's it about? The storyline gives romantic flicks a fun new spin by bringing in an alternate universe. Reality becomes fantasy when a girl's cynicism about love leads her to her worst nightmare. 
For Isn't it Romantic's big moment last night, Chopra walked the pink carpet hand-in-hand with Nick Jonas and the couple shared quite a few sweet moments in front of the camera. The two never shy away from indulging in a little PDA, and the premiere was no exception. Chopra and Nick were all smiles for the camera and after posing for the media, Nick also gave his wife a quick kiss before leaving her to take some solo shots. 
Post the premiere of Isn't It Romantic, Jonas also shared some more love and support for his wife on his official Instagram page, where he posted pictures from the evening with the sweetest caption. Incase you missed it, Chopra responded to the post saying, "U r the best hubby". 
Given that Isn't It Romantic hits theatres on February 13 in the United States (just in time for Valentine's Day!), Priyanka Chopra has already made a handful of promotional appearances to spread word about the movie. After stepping onto the sets of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the actor was also spotted on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and her promotional looks so far have been sleek and sharp. Be it the embellished pantsuit for The Tonight Show or the grey Vivienne Westwood number she picked for her chat with Ellen DeGeneres, Chopra's OOTDs haven't gone unnoticed, but her look from last night is one of her most extravagant yet. While Jonas chose a brown suit for the LA premiere, Chopra brought together several strong elements by opting for a pink and mustard gown with floral embroidery on the skirt. The strapless Vivienne Westwood gown was styled with simple stud earrings and an intense smokey eye, along with pink lips and beachy waves. Chopra and Jonas were also accompanied by the remaining star cast of the movie, which included comedy's favourite Rebel Wilson and Adam DeVine among others. 
Can't wait to check Priyanka Chopra out in Isn't It Romantic? The movie releases worldwide on February 28 on Netflix. While you wait, here's a peek at some of Chopra and Jonas' cutest pink carpet moments from the premiere.

The red carpet proved to be one for the books 
Some of Hollywood's biggest names arrived at the Royal Albert Hall in London for the 2019 British Academy Film Awards, or BAFTAs, the annual ceremony that serves to recognise accomplishments within the film industry. Hosted by BAFTA Fellowship Award winner and Absolutely Fabulous actress Joanna Lumley, the event saw a number of famous faces take to the red carpet in looks that were nothing short of noteworthy. 
The Favourite's Olivia Coleman, who won Leading Actress on the night, was styled by Mary Fellowes in an Emilia Wickstead ivory and black bedini gown, complete with a structured train. “I felt that Olivia should look stately and regal,” Fellowes told British Vogue of her look for the evening. While Lady Gaga was notably absent on the night, attending the Grammys in Los Angeles instead, fellow Leading Actress nominees Glenn Close and Viola Davis walked the carpet in Alexander McQueen and Armani Privé, respectively. 
Kate Middleton attended the award ceremony alongside her husband Prince William, the president of the British Academy Film Awards, who also presented film editor Thelma Schoonmaker with the Fellowship award. The Duchess looked every bit as royal as she is, dressed in a white one-shoulder Alexander McQueen gown that cinched at the waist. Completing the look with a white clutch and silver Jimmy Choo heels, Middleton paid tribute to the late Princess Diana, honouring her by wearing her South Sea pearl earrings, the same pair she wore while accepting the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation's Humanitarian of the Year Award in 1995. 
Best Supporting Actress nominee Margot Robbie caught our attention in an embellished Chanel haute couture gown, while fellow Australian Cate Blanchett debuted her new brunette ‘do in a jaw-dropping black Christopher Kane number complete with a thigh-high split and a plunging jewel encrusted neckline (above).

From Dua Lipa to Jennifer Lopez, see what the stars are wearing to the 61st annual Grammy Awards 
Stars descended upon the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday February 10, 2019 for the 61st Annual Grammy Awards hosted by Alicia Keys. 
One of the most iconic and outrageous red carpets of the season, the Grammy Awards never disappoints in the fashion stakes or on stage. 
Set to perform on the night are the likes of Lady Gaga, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ricky Martin, Miley Cyrus, H.E.R., Camila Cabello, Cardi B, Post Malone, Shawn Mendes and Janelle Monáe. Missing from the line-up is Ariana Grande who seems to be feuding with the show's producer, Ken Ehrlich. 
Those nominated include Cardi B, Drake, Childish Gambino, Dua Lipa and a whole host more of your favourite musical names. The awards show has a reputation for controversial wins and snubs. Think back to just last year when names like Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande were snubbed when it came to the most prestigious accolades, like Album of the Year. 
On the red carpet awards for best dressed will surely go to Miley Cyrus in her pared back black suit or Lady Gaga's silver ruffled number. 
Of course Cardi B stole the show as The Birth of Venus complete with clam shell and pearl belly button but what did you expect from the queen of extreme? The look is the work of Mugler, pulled from the brand's autumn/winter 1995 haute couture show. Another standout from the night was Katy Perry in pink Balmain haute couture and her signature cropped peroxide ‘do.

The Koffee With Karan couch played host to Kriti Sanon and Kartik Aaryan this weekend, and the conversation included Luka Chuppi, nepotism, and Sara Ali Khan 
Karan Johar's obsession with the letter ‘k' came alive this weekend, as Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon came together on Koffee with Karan season 6 for a refreshingly honest chat about breaking through in a tight-knit industry. For their first appearance together on the show, the young stars showed up dressed to kill in a statement velvet blazer and metallic chevron mini respectively. Together, the Luka Chuppi couple gave fans a preview of their easy chemistry and rapport as they toasted their singlehood, discussed their crushes and said like it is about the privilege that star kids are born with. If you missed the episode, here are all the highlights you need to know about. 
Ever since Sara Ali Khan mentioned that she finds Aaryan cute, speculation has been rife about the two new kids on the block. Acknowledging the rumours, he divulged, “Saif sir said that if you've got money, just take her. She is a princess, so to ask her out on a date, you know I would require a certain bank balance. So what I'm doing is, sir, I'm just trying to earn more and more money right now.” 
While he is proud of making it on his own steam, Aaryan admitted that not having connections in the industry inspired him to use his creativity. He revealed, “Social media has actually helped me become an actor. It was through Facebook and Google that I used to look out for auditions. Because I didn't know anyone, I used to search for it by typing keywords like ‘actors required' or ‘casting calls' on Facebook and Google, and then go from New Bombay to Bombay.” 
Given Johar's role in stirring the ongoing conversation around nepotism, it would be impossible to evade the million dollar question. Sanon gracefully ceded, “It's a bit of a struggle when you don't come from a film background.” When asked if she feels that it's easier for star kids like Sara Ali Khan and Janhvi Kapoor to get a foot in the door, she replied, “Of course it is. You are recognised a lot easier. You also get opportunities even before your debut film, and that doesn't happen when you don't come from a film background.” 
The 28-year-old may have hit the big time with the 100-crore grosser, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, but he does have some ambitions of his own. When quizzed about the one movie that he felt he could have done a better job in, he replied, “Andhadhun”. Johar went on to inquire, “And the one lie you can say without batting an eyelid?” “That I could have done a better job in Andhadhun,” he laughed in response. 
Despite having multiple big ticket films on her portfolio, the actor admits that Bareilly Ki Barfi worked as a turning point in her career. When asked if she had it in her to take on the kind of work that Alia Bhatt and Deepika Padukone are doing, she revealed, “I definitely have the ambition. I think Bareilly Ki Barfi changed things for me, because a lot of people didn't see me as a Bitty in a Bareilly kind of world. It was like, she's just an urban girl, she can't pull off a small town role. And I got that even while I was shooting the film. But ever since the movie did well, I have been getting only small town roles which is a huge achievement,” she revealed.

A multi-million-dollar campaign, star-studded dinners, exclusive screenings, tea with Academy members—and a great film, of course. Vogue charts the history of awards campaigns and uncovers a century of plotting in pursuit of that elusive gold statue 
Can an Oscar be bought? It's a question that has plagued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences since its inception. Founded by MGM chief Louis B Mayer in 1927, the Hollywood institution started handing out awards in 1929. Soon, prestige-hungry studios began paying for adverts in trade publications and encouraged stars to campaign. Screen legend Mary Pickford invited Academy members to tea at Pickfair, the grand Beverley Hills estate she occupied with husband Douglas Fairbanks, to convince them to vote for her. The PR stunt resulted in a Best Actress win for Coquette in 1930. Joan Crawford followed suit in 1945, hiring press agent Henry Rogers to secure her the Best Actress statuette for Mildred Pierce. Rogers fed items to gossip columnist Hedda Hopper to keep Crawford's name in the papers and circulated a false rumour that Las Vegas bookmakers had declared her the odds-on favourite to win. 
Rogers was a precursor to the Oscar campaigners of today—seasoned publicists who specialise in planning events, glad-handing voters, building momentum around a film and circumventing the Academy's increasingly strict campaign regulations. Oscars season begins in the autumn with a triumvirate of film festivals—Venice, Telluride and Toronto—where many contenders premiere. The period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is then reserved for screenings, and a litany of parties, luncheons and Q&As follow until the conclusion of Phase One: securing the nomination. Once the shortlist is revealed in early January, campaigners go all out for Phase Two, to clinch the win. The cost of a Best Picture-winning Oscar campaign can run from $20-30 million—double what it cost a decade ago—and campaigners can expect five-figure bonuses for every nomination. 
To win, a strategist must tap into the zeitgeist and construct a plausible narrative around a nominee. Few have done this more effectively than Harvey Weinstein. The disgraced mogul and co-founder of Miramax entered the fray in 1990 with the Daniel Day-Lewis-starring drama My Left Foot. “In those days, the studios had a lock on the Oscars, because none of the indies campaigned aggressively,” he told Peter Biskind in the 2004 book Down and Dirty Pictures. “We ran a guerrilla campaign.” Weinstein's methods ranged from the ingenious to the absurd. How to target older Academy members? Set up events at retirement homes where they lived. How to promote the black and white silent film The Artist? Get Charlie Chaplin's granddaughters to host a special screening. How to secure a Best Actor win for the relatively-unknown Life Is Beautiful star Roberto Benigni? Ask him to relocate from Italy to Los Angeles for a month during the peak voting period. 
A generous budget doesn't hurt either. When Shakespeare in Love went up against front-runner Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture in 1999, Miramax funnelled an unprecedented $15 million into adverts—and it worked. “There was a lot of money being thrown at it,” Steven Spielberg recalled in 2016 on The Hollywood Reporter podcast, Awards Chatter. “I'm not saying we should have campaign finance limits, but I do think the gifts and enticements should be reduced to zero. I think sending out a DVD of our movie is all we should be doing. There's something about the actual campaigning process that what you're campaigning for gets forgotten. It's the power of persuasion over the power of the story.” Producer Bill Mechanic, whose movie The Thin Red Line also floundered in the face of Miramax that year, agreed, telling the New York Times, “It's like the process of trying to win an election. It's about how much money you spend.” 
Other studios were getting in on the action too, realising that maximum press traction comes from creating a campaign with a story to tell. For the 2013 thriller Captain Phillips, Sony Pictures made the movie's real-life protagonist—a merchant mariner who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009—a fixture on the awards circuit. He attended the Oscars, gave TV interviews and appeared on the cover of Parade magazine alongside Tom Hanks, who played him in the film. It was part of an enormous total spend; emails uncovered during the 2014 Sony hack revealed that executives discussed spending $4.2 million on Phase One campaigning, while awards consultant Cynthia Swartz had proposed a budget that included $250,000 to send DVDs to all 160,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild, $700,000 for TV and radio ads, and $250,000 on travel costs. 
In 2013, Weinstein took campaigning to another level when he hired Stephanie Cutter, President Obama's former campaign manager, to promote the comedy-drama Silver Linings Playbook. According to Vulture, she was asked to market it “not just [as] a well-made movie, but a culturally relevant and especially politically significant film that was shaping the national conversation about mental health triggered in part by the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.” Cue a heavily-publicised trip to the White House, during which the film's director David O. Russell and star Bradley Cooper sat down with Vice President Joe Biden to discuss the issue. That same year, Spielberg's presidential biopic Lincoln went one step further, bringing the (former) president to the awards ceremony; Bill Clinton appeared at the Golden Globes to support Spielberg's presidential biopic Lincoln, calling it “extraordinary”. 
A game of serious one-upmanship ensued. In 2014, The Weinstein Company recruited the woman who inspired Philomena—the story of a mother whose child was forcibly put up for adoption by the Catholic Church—to discuss adoption policy with senators and meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican. For Alan Turing biopic The Imitation Game the following year, Weinstein lobbied Parliament to retroactively pardon those once imprisoned for homosexuality (Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts in 1952). He also bought billboards that read: “Honour this movie. Honour this man. And honour the movement to bring justice to the other 49,000.” During one of Weinstein's final campaigns, for the 2017 contender Lion, he organised special screenings co-hosted by UNICEF and partnered with the Charity Network to launch #LionHeart, a campaign to provide financial support for homeless children. His methods were mocked, but they produced results: in 27 years, Weinstein's electioneering garnered 81 Oscar wins and 341 nominations. 
Since his expulsion from the Academy in October 2017, the Oscars race has been no less chaotic. Weinstein's legacy looms large and many of Hollywood's top strategists are Miramax alumni: Cynthia Swartz (20th Century Fox's The Revenant, A24's Moonlight), Tony Angellotti (Columbia Pictures' Zero Dark Thirty, Universal's Get Out) and Lisa Taback (Participant Media's Spotlight, Lionsgate's La La Land). Unlike their former boss, they shun the spotlight and don't speak publicly about their campaigns—but the tactics remain the same. 
Ahead of last year's ceremony, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was promoted as an expression of feminist rage that chimed with the #MeToo movement. Fantasy fable The Shape of Water, directed by Mexican maestro Guillermo del Toro, became a rallying cry in support of immigrants and in defiance of President Trump's calls to build a wall. For Get Out, Universal went all out, buying giant billboards, compiling a book of fan art, creating a #sunkenplace hashtag with a promotional emoji and hosting elaborate parties on the backlot. The campaign cost an estimated $6 million—the film was made for just $4.5 million. The result? Four nominations and a Best Original Screenplay win. 
Multi-million-dollar campaigns are increasingly becoming the norm, and while you can't pay your way to the podium, smaller films without sizeable campaign budgets tend to fall by the wayside. This year, Netflix is waging one of the most expensive Oscar campaigns of all time for Alfonso Cuarón's Roma, believed to cost at least $25 million. The streaming giant has reportedly sent voters everything from Oaxacan dark chocolates to signed posters from Cuarón and a coffee table book about the film published by Assouline. They also poached veteran campaigner Taback in July 2018, making her Vice President of Talent Relations. Meanwhile, Swartz has been hired by Disney to orchestrate its Black Panther campaign. So far it has included an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey, who called it “bigger than a movie”. It appears to have paid off. On 22 January, the Academy announced the nominations for the 2019 Oscars. Roma leads the pack, along with The Favourite, with 10 nods each. Black Panther also made history as the first superhero film ever to be nominated for Best Picture. Critical darlings like Leave No Trace, The Rider and Private Life received nothing at all. Final voting opens on 12 February, and as Phase Two begins it's still all to play for. Cheque books at the ready…

Is it too much to ask? 
In case you haven't heard, a period emoji is coming to keyboards near you this March, but before you get too excited, there's a catch. 
While the new emoji, which is one of 59 that Unicode is set launch in 2019, is being touted as one that symbolises a female's menstrual cycle, it's really just a drop of blood. An incredibly vague red droplet, much like the blue-hued water droplet we already have. 
Teen Vogue is reporting that the drop of blood was added to the next launch of updated emojis in response to a campaign championed by Plan International UK, one that called for period representation. 
“We are thrilled to announce that we are actually getting a #PeriodEmoji!" the organization shared on Twitter. "It is through your support that we can now celebrate that... @unicode have announced that we will get our first ever #PeriodEmoji in March 2019.” 
[#twitter: ] 
Considering half the population menstruates once a month for approximately five to seven days, we didn't think it was too much to ask. However, we can't help but wonder why the period emoji is so vague, when others are detailed enough to be universally recognised as everything from a person fencing, to the late Bowie, to an astronaut, a dragon and a burrito. 
Why do we have to have a whole selection of tools including a spanner, a hammer, and many others we can't even begin to name, but we can't have so much as a tampon or a pad? 
While the new emoji can be considered a step in the right direction, and one that will help break down the stigma associated with periods, here's hoping that the next update will deliver one that is a little more explicit.

From that incredible cake to other celebrity guests (including Taimur Ali Khan), here's all you need to know from Karan Johar’s twins’ birthday party 
Karan Johar goes by many titles, including Bollywood director, writer, producer and TV host. But the one tag he is most proud, by his own admission, of is of being a father. The doting dad to twins Yash and Roohi celebrated their second birthday yesterday, and as predicted, it was a blast for both, the birthday boy and girl, and those who attended. 
Starting the day with wishing his kids, Johar posted a video on his Instagram story of himself singing, "Happy Birthday" to the twins, who beamed at their father. The day was followed by a big celebration for their birthday at Bandra's Taj Lands End Hotel. 
It's not a Bollywood kid birthday without the many sweet, curated details, and this one was no exception. The twins, of course, wore matching outfits, with sporty bomber jackets and jeans. But it was the three-tier reel cake is what got everyone's attention. The cake had pictures of Yash and Roohi on it like a showreel, and in the birthday video, Karan Johar was seen holding Roohi and Yash on each side as they blew out their candles, with their grandmother sitting next to them. 
Newly-married couple Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone joined the celebrations, along with other celebrities. Singh, who has been promoting Gully Boy, took some time out from the events to attend the bash. The couple enjoyed the party and even made a fan's day by clicking a picture with him. 
Varun Dhawan was also in attendance, and was seen holding Yash while Roohi played with the toys at the party. Besides Dhawan, Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi, Mira Kapoor and daughter Misha, and Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur were also seen at the twins' second birthday celebrations.

Last night, Priyanka Chopra became part of the list of Bollywood celebrities who have been immortalised with wax statues by Madame Tussauds, and her reaction was hilarious 
After Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma, global icon Priyanka Chopra was the latest Bollywood celebrity to get "waxed"—the star treated her fans with a surprise from Madame Tussauds New York this Thursday as she took the curtains off of her first ever wax statue. The star appeared to be pleasantly surprised at the uncanny resemblance when she saw the revealed figurine. “That's crazy, that's insane,” she commented as she circled the statue. 
The actor took to her Instagram to share her excitement, her post read “🤯 <-- Me when I saw my new wax figure at Madame Tussauds in NYC @nycwax (Coming to other locations soon!!) 4 figures. UK, Australia, Asia coming up! Thank you to the Madame Tussaud's team.”. What makes this revelation even better is that the statue will soon be coming to London, Sydney and Asia as well. One more milestone to add to the star's success on the global front. 
The red gown that Chopra's wax statue is dressed in is what she wore at the 2016 Emmy Awards, a custom-made Jason Wu creation. Striking the exact same pose as the statue for the cameras in an all-black outfit (which was almost the only difference between the real and the wax versions), she startled the viewers when she exclaimed “It's me!”. “I was really surprised, and I love my eyebrows” she said. 
In case you missed it, the 36-year-old actor was recently married to Nick Jonas in not one but two beautiful ceremonies, both in Jodhpur. The first one was a classic white wedding where Chopra Jonas adorned a stunning white gown with a 75-foot train in custom Ralph Lauren, while the second wedding was done in a traditional Hindu style. She wore a red, tone-on-tone Sabyasachi lehenga with French embroidery. 
Currently, Priyanka Chopra is busy promoting her upcoming Hollywood film Isn't is Romantic which features her alongside Rebel Wilson and Liam Hemsworth, which releases on February 13. Soon after, the star will be making a Bollywood comeback by appearing in The Sky Is Pink alongside Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim, also said to have a February release date.

Roohi and Yash Johar celebrate their second birthday on February 7. What has dad Karan Johar planned for his twins? Get all the details now. 
February 7, 2017 marked a big moment for producer and director Karan Johar, who surprised all his fans, followers and well-wishers with news of himself becoming a father to twins via surrogacy. Johar brought his children Roohi and Yash Johar home with the sweetest announcement back in 2017, saying “I am ecstatic to share with you all the two most wonderful additions to my life, my children and life lines; Roohi and Yash”. It's hard to believe that it's already been two years since Johar's special day. Tomorrow, Roohi and Yash will celebrate their second birthday, and reports state that Johar has already revealed some of his plans for the milestone moment. 
Given that some of Karan Johar's closest friends are Bollywood's most-loved celebrities, rumour has it that Roohi Johar and Yash Johar's second birthday bash will be attended by an exciting set of guests. “The guest list has several star kids including Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's son Taimur, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput's daughter Misha, Rani Mukherji and Aditya Chopra's daughter Adira, Soha Ali Khan and Kunal Kemmu's daughter Inaaya, Tusshar Kapoor's son Laksshya and Aayush Sharma and Arpita Khan's son Ahil,” says one source. “The kiddie gang gets along well, their parents had even shared videos from Laksshya's birthday celebrations of all the fun they have when they get together. Many games and activities have been planned for the young ones. The invites were sent out well in advance, many star parents are likely to join their tots too.” 
In case you missed, Johar kept things slightly low key for Roohi and Yash Johar's first birthday, hosting a small but cheerful get-together at his Bandra residence in 2018. But this time around, the director is said to be making grander plans, and may host his kids' birthday celebration at Bandra's Taj Land's End hotel. Last year, Roohi and Yash Johar's at-home birthday was attended by the likes of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, Manish Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha, along with Taimur Ali Khan and AbRam Khan. 
Can't wait to see what goes down at Roohi and Yash Johar's second birthday? Pictures are sure to start surfacing soon tomorrow. Until then, here's a peek at some of the adorable duo's cutest moments of late.

From actors to entrepreneurs, writers and designers, these women are inspiring people around the world with their empowering stories 
Documenting the lives of cocoa farmers in South America; fighting for the rights of restaurant workers; creating binge-worthy television shows that capture the zeitgeist; bringing together people and celebrating the art of gathering; teaching 90,000 girls how to code—these are just a few of the day jobs of Indian women across the globe. Ahead, we bring to you 49 of the brightest actors, entrepreneurs, writers and designers who are creating powerful legacies. These are their incredible stories.

“The complexities that Indian women face are present in my writing, because that's my entire DNA,” says Instagram sensation Rupi Kaur about her dual identities—the Indian girl at home and the Canadian girl when she steps out. ‘The Queen of Insta-Poets' is what Rolling Stone calls her, designers are all eager to dress her and the reaction to her often sold-out shows is not unlike one at a rock concert. With her pithy words, Kaur has managed to bring poetry to a new audience. The writing, she says, was completely unplanned, and the response an incredible surprise. An obsessive reader, she started writing at a young age. “In middle school, I wrote on boys I had crushes on, in high school it became a political act; I wrote about the changes I wanted to see. In university, it was a lot more reflection.” So as a cultural poster girl for the millennial generation, what advice would she give them? “Take it from me: the internet, although great, isn't always great for your soul. Reach into your inner self and do the things you fear. Take the risks.”—Priyanka Khanna

A bestselling book, collaborations with Michelle Obama and Priyanka Chopra, cameos in films and TV, and a production company called Unicorn Island Productions later, it's hard to think that Lilly Singh's launchpad was a YouTube channel titled ‘Superwoman' in 2010. Now, nine years in, her videos, which tackle everything from gender stereotypes to last-minute Halloween costumes, rack up to 2 billion views and 14 million subscribers. The Indo-Canadian Sikh who grew up in Ontario had just wrapped up a degree in Psychology from York University, Toronto, when she started vlogging her first confessions. She was intrigued by the simplicity of online video—“literally, just being human on camera”—and moved to Los Angeles to further her career. Apart from highlighting her heritage in videos like ‘When it's your birthday, but you're brown', Singh also started #GirlLove, a campaign to wipe out cyber bullying and girl-on-girl hate, proceeds of which were donated to primary schooling for girls in Kenya and the Malala Fund.—Akanksha Kamath 
Any given week of any given month, Delhi-born Diipa Khosla will be jetting off to anywhere up to three continents. In September alone, she covered India, where she got married to her Dutch boyfriend (the virtual wedding got 13 million views); New York, for the Victoria's Secret show (“I met Alessandra Ambrosio before she did her last walk after 25 years as an Angel”); and back to Europe (where she lives between Amsterdam and London). “I was studying international law and my first internship was at the International Criminal Court in the Hague,” she says. This was before coming to the realisation that influence comes in various forms. “It was 2013 and there were no Indian influencers on the global scene doing luxury fashion and lifestyle. I figured this would fit me perfectly, and three-and-a-half years later, here we are.” The ‘here we are' being billboards at Piccadilly Circus for Maybelline's diversity campaign, working closely with UN Women and UNFPA and considering co-owning a cruelty-free makeup line.—Akanksha Kamath

How often do you find someone who's broken the internet with 10 million views on a single YouTube video? Meet Deepica Mutyala, whose contouring videos are correcting the under-representation of brown women in the American beauty industry. Her pet project, Tinted, began when her obsessive love for makeup found zero tutorials relevant to her skin colour. “Growing up, I had dyed my hair blonde and wore blue contacts because that was considered beautiful. So, when a video I filmed on my iPhone using red lipstick to hide my dark circles went viral last year, I quit my job!” But garnering likes on social media is one thing and turning it into a full-blown business quite another. “My father wanted me to live the American Dream (read: become a doctor like the rest of my family). I eschewed the tradition for a newer definition of the phrase—one that means being a game changer and shattering glass ceilings.” What's followed is collaborations with beauty giants like M.A.C and L'Oréal and a growing #TintFam of 500K followers and counting.—Akanksha Kamath 
“Freshpaper actually began as my middle-school science project based on a home remedy my grandma gave me to drink while I was visiting her in India,” says the Harvard grad and CEO and founder of The Fresh glow Co. Kavita Shukla was born in Germany, and lived in Finland and India before moving to the United States. As a young girl, Shukla spent most of her spare time tinkering with science experiments and art projects in the garage. One of those led to a simple innovation that reduces food waste (over 25 per cent of the world's food supply is lost to spoilage), the spice-infused Freshpaper, which inhibits bacterial and fungal growth and keeps food fresh for longer. Her journey involved selling batches at the local farmer's market, and Freshpaper is now available in over 180 countries. “The last few years have been a series of pinch-me moments—speaking at the Nobel Prize Dialogues in Stockholm about the future of food, testifying in Congress about our unlikely entrepreneurial journey, and being named in Time's “5 Most Innovative Women in Food” list. The most surreal moment was winning the Index: Design to Improve Life Award, previously awarded to Apple and Tesla.”—Priyanka Khanna 
“I always thought I would end up in medicine,” says the woman behind chic childrenswear label Monica + Andy. After a decade working in the pharmaceutical industry, her brother's experience launching Bonobos sparked her entrepreneurial spirit. After the birth of her daughter, Royer became conscious of the lack of high-quality, organic clothing for children. The result was Monica + Andy, a thoughtful childrenswear label strong on the digital platform and now with ‘guide shops', as they refer to them, in Chicago and New York. There are three really exciting parts of the job. “The first is working with and building a team. Then meeting our customers and their little ones. And of course, watching it all through the eyes of my daughter. She is the inspiration behind everything I do.”—Priyanka Khanna 
For 27-year-old Seema Bansal, co-founder of Venus Et Fleur, the idiom ‘to stop and smell the roses' has a dual meaning. After receiving a terrible delivery of Valentine's Day flowers from her now husband Sunny Chadha, they decided to create a luxury rose atelier in 2015. In just a few years, they've become the go-to florists for the Kardashians (millennial validation, if there ever was one), found their spot on the Forbes 30 under-30 entrepreneur list, and rang the NASDAQ bell. Oh, and the estimated growth of their business stood at an astounding 226 per cent last year. “The most exciting part is seeing my designs come to life in our products. I love innovating,” she says, adding that Sara Blakely's success with Spanx has been a big influence. When it comes to her personal style, she veers towards neutral classics. “Being put-together and feminine is very important for me.” Shoes are her go-to, with Saint Laurent and Stuart Weitzman topping the list. For her wedding last month, she observed all the Sikh traditions, and wore looks from Anita Dongre. “I'm Punjabi and my love for Indian culture runs deep, from the food to Bollywood movies and of course, the fashion! I embrace it all!”—Priyanka Khanna

Supriya Lele's initiation into fashion was her mother's large collection of saris that travelled with her from India to England long before Supriya was born. Today, in her eponymous label, which held its first solo presentation at London Fashion Week, drapery styles of the six-yard staple can clearly be seen. Born to two doctors in a small village in the UK's West Midlands, Lele's grown up in a British-Asian generation that constantly curates the contrasting forces of East and West. “I am of Indian heritage and I am also British. I want to create a modern feminine dialogue between two cultures that focuses on the female body and has an openness and lightness within it,” she told Vogue.com of her mix-and-match aesthetic. “I did my BA at Edinburgh College of Art and then completed my MA at the Royal College of Art in London,” says the designer, who briefly studied architecture before turning to fashion. “I think the three disciplines cross over a lot. My interest in architecture informs my minimalist aesthetic.”—Akanksha Kamath 
“I've always felt like a hybrid character; as a kid I felt quite lost whenever someone asked me where I was from,” says Rosh Mahtani, whose grandparents were displaced during Partition and moved to Zambia. “I loved writing, photography and telling stories. I started making one piece of jewellery for every poem in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy so that I could create a narrative through fashion.” The result is over 60 international stockists including Matches and Net-a-Porter. Her mantra is simple: “I don't believe there is a set formula or way of doing things. Follow your instinct and don't try to follow a set path.”—Priyanka Khanna 
The Goldsmiths graduate credits her yearly trips to hometown Indore for shaping her design ethos. “The colours and inspirational forms, along with the narratives, form the backbone of my current jewellery collections,” says Sethi. In 2018, just a year after floating her own brand, AS by Akansha Sethi, she participated in London Fashion Week. “After 10 years of the designer showrooms started by the British Fashion Council, it was a pleasant surprise when, on the last day of the Week, Her Majesty the Queen made an impromptu visit. It was a privilege to show her my jewellery and explain the story behind each collection,” says Sethi.—Sheree Gomes Gupta 
In March last year, Saloni Lodha celebrated 10 years of her London-based eponymous label. Her choice of destination, Udaipur, and the theme, Holi. “Of all the festivals in India, I hold Holi closest to my heart. It is the most dramatic expression of life, full of colour and fun,” says the designer who was born to a traditional Marwari family in Nashik and now lives in Hong Kong. To encapsulate the spirit of Saloni, what played out was a three-day unabashed party speckled with colour and familiar faces from the fashion fraternity including Giambattista Valli, Caroline Issa, Aquazzura's Edgardo Osorio, and Peter Dundas. Her universally flattering tea dresses have found favour among everyone from Queen Maxima of the Netherlands to Lily James, the Duchess of Cambridge and Deepika Padukone. “I always keep my Indian heritage in mind while designing but without translating it literally into our clothes. Our way of bringing the Indian soul into collections is through bold colours and patterns.”—Akanksha Kamath 
“Less is more” is a mantra Shilpa Shah and her partner Karla Gallardo live and work by. A lack of fulfilment in the relentless consumption that the fashion industry demands, led them to launch Cuyana, a range of women's essentials that fall between fast fashion and luxury goods. “We believe that you can have amazing quality and curated design, and it can still be accessible. We have travelled the world to find the best materials and the most passionate craftsmen out there. Each product we create is carefully considered from beginning to end,” she says. The daughter of Punjabi parents, she says, “Being Indian is part of everything I do. It has formed the foundation of my work with Cuyana. My love for textiles comes from growing up around the rich fabrics of Indian clothing. We wanted to make materials mean something again.”—Priyanka Khanna

On the AMC show Dietland, the series with a dark comedic perspective on women's issues, Ami Sheth plays an artist and acid attack survivor. “Sana is strong, sensitive and has devoted her life to helping other women. Getting to transform into her physically was also a new challenge for me,” says Sheth, who underwent hours of prosthetics for the role. “I've been acting my entire life but never thought I could make my living doing it,” says the New Jersey-born and -raised actor who studied to be a veterinary doctor at Boston University and has also had a role on the show Blindspot. Not surprisingly, she lists Priyanka Chopra as a woman she admires. “The strides she's made help the other Indian actresses trying to succeed,” she says.—Priyanka Khanna 
Raised in New Jersey by Indian immigrants who moved to New York from Kerala in the 1970s, Menon's passion for filmmaking was ignited early on. “My father, realising there was nowhere to see Malayalam films in New York, began screening films and bringing artistes from South Indian cinema over to the US for performances,” she recalls. At 19, she learnt how to shoot and edit. “I bought cameras with part-time jobs, shot short films with friends in my apartment,” says the director whose résumé boasts a Bachelor's degree in Art History from Columbia University and a Master's in Film from USC's School of Cinematic Arts. Recent career highlights include attending a writers' lab at the Sundance Institute with partner Tanuj Chopra to work on their new television project, a contemporary Indian American adaptation of Devdas. “Being able to write stories for the South Asian diaspora and have those stories recognised in Hollywood is a true career goal.”—Sheree Gomes Gupta

Patel, who grew up idolising media mogul Oprah Winfrey and star reporter Connie Chung, volunteered at a television station at night whilst pursuing an Engineering degree. “This is what steered my path to working in television and storytelling,” she says. Currently an entertainment reporter for ET Canada and the host of Home To Win on HGTV Canada, her style changes with her roles. “From weather presenter, lifestyle and entertainment host to mother, wife, fitness influencer and philanthropist…I experiment with fashion for my many roles, especially when it comes to Canadian designers. In my busy day, leggings are a staple.”—Sheree Gomes Gupta 
How many people can list a career highlight as “advocating for Mindy Kaling's first TV show The Mindy Project, where she was the creator, producer and star?” As the highest ranking Indian American in Hollywood, Netflix's Bela Bajaria is probably the only one. Chances are, if there's been a binge-worthy television show, she and her team have been involved. In her career she's overseen shows like Master Of None, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Sinner, Riverdale and My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman, to name a few. While at Universal Television, Bajaria was offered this role that sits at the intersection of Hollywood and technology. “Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, is creative, a big fan of film and TV, and very strategic, so when he pitched me this unique job to launch the unscripted initiative and major studios co-licensing, I took it.” She adds, “My Indian roots are also a strength and asset in storytelling. I love bringing my Indian background into work, whether that is in a show or introducing Indian food to my teams or wearing a sari to the Emmys and Golden Globes. The upbringing of community and warmth is an asset in managing teams at work, too.”—Priyanka Khanna

“Indian Annie Hall meets Katharine Hepburn—collared shirts with pyjama pants or a skirt, with white sneakers and a statement necklace,” says Oman-raised, New York-based Shruti Rya Ganguly, who runs her own production company, Honto88. It was while in class at Northwestern University that Ganguly saw Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali and had an epiphany. “Film combined everything I loved—art, design, culture, curiosity and music, and there was a business component to it, too.” She worked on the sets of Kaal (2005) and Chameli (2003), moving to New York to work at Island Def Jam. What followed were stints at Nylon, an MBA at NYU, and an MFA in film at Tisch, working with James Franco on films, a job at MTV Desi and finally Condé Nast, where she launched ‘73 Questions' at Vogue. She's now prepping to direct her first film, but her career highlight still includes being on a committee for the Obama administration. “As the only non-American, immigration, women's rights and climate changes are things I discussed openly.”—Priyanka Khanna

How many of us can pinpoint our career paths to an allergic reaction? Part-time model, documentary filmmaker and student on her way to bagging a PhD from Oxford University, Kumar's career as a field conservation biologist in the Australian Outback took a turn when she became allergic to eucalyptus! The 24-year-old multi-hyphenate then began studying human evolutionary biology, with a focus on colourism. Born in Sydney, Australia, to a Punjabi father and Bengali mother, she now lives between cities—London is her current location, while New York serves as her professional base. Her wardrobe, similarly, is a cultural conflation. Think vintage meets grunge and a little bit bohemian. The one constant through it all? “I can never leave home without my Dr Martens.”—Akanksha Kamath

Born Kumari Lohar-Singh on a military base in California, Suraj's debut on Fox's popular dance reality show, So You Think You Can Dance, choreographing the show's first ‘Waack' performance in 2011, put the spotlight firmly on her individuality. She's continued to gain recognition with her work for Dizzy Rascal, MC Hammer and Mya. Currently studying at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Los Angeles, Suraj's style reflects her Indian, African and native American cultures complimented with vintage pieces by YSL and Chanel, disco sequins and sportswear labels. Next up, a ‘queer-centric' social media-based brand Her Drummer Her Dancer in collaboration with her fiancé, Malinder Tooray. “Our aim is to continue inspiring and supporting other queer desi and interracial couples,” says Suraj, an active member of the LGBT community.—Sheree Gomes Gupta

An electronic music producer and drummer whose mission is to “elevate and celebrate the female voice,” Gandhi regards herself as an artist and activist. “My parents were always invested in giving back.” When the family moved to New York, Gandhi, then eight, was aware of how privileged she was. “It was about not writing a cheque, but about getting involved in the community in a hands on way,” says Gandhi, who recently hosted a voting awareness programme at her home for 500 people. Touring with rapper M.I.A during her first semester at Harvard Business School was a high point for Gandhi. “Another highlight was running the London Marathon on my cycle and starting a conversation about how we treat menstruation in various cultures,” says Gandhi. “I want to become the best version of myself; I put out a song called ‘Bad Habits' [it rose to No 8 on the viral US top 50 Spotify charts], which is a sort of an accountability anthem.” She's a firebrand even when it comes to her dressing, with red, yellow and orange being her preferred palette. “Mae Studio and NorBlack NorWhite give an update to traditional Indian patterns. I do that, too, in my activism and in my music.”—Sheree Gomes Gupta 
Music wasn't always on the agenda for Chennai-born LA-based artist Vidya Iyer. “It's been the longest road to get here. While I may have grown up learning Carnatic music, I studied Psychology and Pre-medicine and was firmly on the path to becoming a doctor,” says Iyer. A collaboration with American composer and clarinetist Shankar Tucker is what triggered the transition from aspiring doctor to YouTube star. “I toured with Shankar's ensemble when I was in college and after graduating. Then I came to Mumbai to immerse myself in learning music. After two years, I moved in with my mom in DC, started my YouTube channel and here we are.” Today, her cross-continental journey has influenced both her viral mashups and sartorial sensibilities. “My style motto is: What if Coachella came to Rajasthan? So, you'll find lots of big oxidized jewellery, Indian prints in Western silhouettes, my mom's and grandmom's old saris and pyjamas!”—Neharika Manjani 
“Technically, I spend half my time living in London and half my time living in Los Angeles, but in reality I'm mainly living out of a suitcase, constantly on tour,” says Aithchison, better known by her stage name Charli XCX and as the voice behind popular hits like ‘Boom Clap' and ‘I Got It'. Born to an Ugandan-Indian mother, she is yet to visit India but says growing up in her grandparents' home has given her a strong understanding of traditions. At 14, she was contacted by a London promoter to perform and ever since there's been no looking back. “I was very inspired by party culture from a young age. I've been making music for 10 years now and I also write songs for other artists, including Icona Pop, Iggy Azalea and Selena Gomez.” She left school soon after, and in the last decade has grown as an artist and a performer. “I think becoming more confident with who I am and letting go of the fear of what people will think is a personal highlight. I have found what is unique to me and I'm very proud of that.”—Priyanka Khanna

Born and raised in London to an Indian mother and British father, Zara Martin's striking looks and rock ‘n' roll image first helped launch her career as a model and TV presenter when, during an unpaid internship at MTV she convinced her bosses into putting her on screen to host her own segment. Her passion for music—hip hop, in particular—eventually led her to deejaying. Today Martin is one of London's leading DJs on the fashion and private party circuit. She has worked with global fashion and tech brands, including the likes of Chanel, Samsung, Estée Lauder, Tom Ford and Versace, and collaborated with British high-street favourite label Skinny Dip to create a line of headphones sold in Topshop and ASOS. Next up for this multitasker is a film with Freida Pinto, releasing later this year. More than just a pretty face, Martin, an Economics graduate, is also an ambassador for Women For Women International, a charity dedicated to helping female survivors of war rebuild their lives and choose their own futures.—Malika Dalamal

“I grew up in Melbourne with my Australian (Scottish and Prussian) mother and Indian father. I always felt a little different. It wasn't until the first time I visited India that I realised I was truly a mix, a clash, a balance of both East and West. All my deep interests, subtle quirks, curiosities that seemed a little different from the average Australian seemed to make sense,” says Luther, who has been moving addresses since she was 19. For her, a job is not a static, desk-bound scenario. It's studying human rights, acting and theatre, modelling, singing and a side hustle concocting perfumes using natural Ayurvedic ingredients. Right now, though, modelling gives her the financial freedom to explore the world, while music is her creative outlet. “I have been writing songs since I was 10 and now I'm recording my first album in Los Angeles.” When off-duty, she wears a uniform of all-black. “I'm usually preoccupied, so black is simple. And I love anything vintage from the '60s. Most of the time I live in well-loved cashmere sweaters.”—Akanksha Kamath 
Tiya Sarcar was born to professor parents and holds a degree in Business but don't let her academic background fool you. The 36-year-old (you might recognise her as the Twilight fan in The Internship or as the real Eleanor in The Good Place) traces her love for performing back to her toddler years— the Texas-born actor began training in dance when she was only two and a half years old. At the age of 18 she landed in LA and promptly bagged her first role in an episode of Disney's Hannah Montana. Since then she has made appearances in a slew of binge-worthy series (Vampire Diaries and Master Of None, to name a few) and lent her voice to Star Wars Rebels. Fun fact? The multihyphenate is also multilingual—Sircar can speak Bengali, French, Spanish and Italian.—Neharika Manjani 
Ever since her breakthrough performance in 2013 that won her the ‘New Face' award at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal, Nancherla's rise has been meteoric. In the last five years, she's written for several successful shows, including Late Night With Seth Meyers, appeared on Inside Amy Schumer, got her own half-hour special on Netflix's The Standups, and starred in A Simple Favour, with Blake Lively. Having suffered depression and anxiety, Nancherla's signature performances include her humorous take on mental health disorders without trivialising the issue. In fact, she's so committed that she created ‘Blue Woman Group', a podcast that aims to help “overcome issues facing modern depressives.” Exciting times are ahead for Nancherla—Disney Junior recently announced a new animated show Mira, Royal Detective with an all-South Indian cast including Kal Penn, Aasif Mandvi, Freida Pinto and Nancherla, to be launched next year. It's no surprise then that the Indian-American has garnered a massive fan following in just a few years.—Sheree Gomes Gupta 
“I was one of only a handful of Indian American students. However, I was fortunate that my parents were part of a strong Indian community in Dallas that kept me connected to the culture,” says Kinjil Mathur, who now as the chief marketing o­fficer of tech start-up Squarespace counts herself in the 3 per cent of women of colour who are C-level executives in the United States. “Sharing my experiences as a first-generation Indian American woman and fighting the good fight to change the ratio is part of my everyday,” she says. This year, the 37-year old, along with her team, galvanised feminist customers, including the likes of Gloria Steinem, to raise awareness around pay equity between men and women. On any given day the girl boss gravitates towards monochromatic dressing but the devil lies in the details. “It's how I express the day's mood—curious with unexpected embellishments, strong with structured fabrics and playful with interesting cuts.”—Neharika Manjani 
If Sonali De Rycker penned an autobiography, it would probably have a chapter called ‘Around the world in envy-inducing jobs'. “I was raised in Mumbai. My father worked in a public sector job, and from an early age I understood I had to control my own destiny,” says De Rycker, who moved to the US after scoring a scholarship at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, kick-started her career with Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs and is now partner at London-based venture capital firm Accel. “We invest early in technology-enabled businesses like Facebook, Flipkart, Dropbox, Slack, Spotify and Supercell,” she adds. Despite her hectic schedule, De Rycker routinely takes trips to Delhi and Mumbai to see family and friends. So, it comes as no surprise when she reveals Michelle Obama is her role model. “She's whip-smart, inspirational and it never seems to come at the expense of her family commitments.”—Neharika Manjani 
“On January 14, 1973, my parents arrived in the United States, five dollars in their pockets, and carrying bundles of used clothes,” says Reshma Saujani, who has clearly inherited their survival instinct. After three attempts, she got into Yale Law School. She interned at the Clinton White House, ran for Congress and lost, but that didn't deter her from setting up Girls Who Code, which, in just a few years, has touched the lives of 90,000 young girls. “Every time I hear about a girl building a website to save the bees or a microchip to keep our communities safe from gun violence, I remember the importance of our work. We're closing the gender gap in tech—imagine a future where all our girls are able to build and create with code,” she says. What's been her biggest influence? “I've always admired women in history who have taken their power—whatever they could find, whatever was given to them, and whatever they found within themselves—to work for change.” She has a toddler at home, so what does she hope to pass on? “Do the things that scare you. You'll never get ahead if you're holding yourself back out of the fear of imperfection. It's time to be brave, not perfect.”—Priyanka Khanna

Before she found her calling at MIT, Boston-based Sangeeta Bhatia worked the watch counter in a department store, the dressing room in a clothing store and even taught step aerobics for a free gym membership. “I had a long line of unglamorous jobs before I found my passion at 30,” says Bhatia. Now, the mother to two girls is the founder of a biotech start-up that focuses on the use of nanotechnology to detect diseases and deftly juggles two roles at MIT (she's a professor and diversity advocate), all while raising style stakes—stilettos are a staple. “The students joke that they can hear me coming,” she says. The ardent multitasker, whose parents immigrated from India to the US over five decades ago, turns to social media to stay in touch with her scattered family. “My husband is also originally from India. Each of us has a sister and 30 first cousins across the globe!”—Neharika Manjani 
Anjali Sud embarked on her journey of disparate experience gathering early on. At 14 she swapped the comforts of home in Michigan (her parents migrated to the US in the 1980s) for boarding school. A degree at Wharton, and a rainbow of gigs, including investment banking and toy buying at Amazon, followed. “Each experience taught me a different skill set and helped me become a better decision maker,” she says. She landed at the video hosting site in 2014 to lead the marketing team, and was named CEO last year. “Having my teammates stand up to welcome me into the role was a moment I will never forget,” she says. Also last year, in another instance of life coming full circle, Vimeo opened their first Indian office in Bengaluru, and visiting was a highlight for this first-generation American who is “fiercely proud” of her Indian heritage.—Parizaad Khan Sethi 
“As Indian women, this is our time!” Anjula Acharia should know. She's made it her mission to promote South Asian talent, most famously, through our country's most well-known exports, our cover girl Priyanka Chopra. As one of the few South Asians in Buckinghamshire, England, the lack of representation around her and in the media angered Acharia, “I knew that whatever I did professionally would need to give a voice to those who for too long had been ignored,” she says. After college she co-founded Desi Hits with record producer Jimmy Lovine, and they brought Bollywood to Hollywood and vice-versa—Lady Gaga, 50 Cent and Britney Spears came to India, and she famously launched Chopra in America. She also calls herself an accidental investor. In 2013, she wrote Payal Kadakia of ClassPass her first check. Today ClassPass has raised US$255 million and partners with more than 10,000 fitness studios in 50 global markets. Other companies that have benefited from her mentorship include The Muse, Thrive Causemetics, Yumi, Bulletproof Coffee, Pop & Bottle.“There's nothing as thrilling as finding talent and nurturing it. My advice is to always think big. If your vision and dream don't scare you, you're not thinking big enough. Also, hustle and hustle hard, and don't ever feel sorry for yourself.”—Priyanka Khanna 
Born in Gwalior, India, and raised in Wellington, New Zealand, Bhasin's first job was at DST international, an investment banking software company. “I eventually attended Harvard Business School.” Over three years ago Bhasin joined Magic Leap, the spatial computing company building the world's next computing platform, leading all strategic business and corporate development. “The most exciting part of my work is the unpredictability of my day. A call to Europe with a creative partner, work on an M&A deal in the afternoon and end the day having dinner with a filmmaker.” A career highlight, she says, was sharing Magic Leap demos with the world last year at L.E.A.P.—the company's first-ever conference focused on all things spatial computing. “It was wonderful to see the diversity of experiences—from Shakespeare with the Royal Shakespeare Company to surgery with BrainLab,” she recalls.—Sheree Gomes Gupta

“I actually lived in India when Vogue launched, so I always ask my friends to carry back issues for me,” says Bulawayo-born Parker, who, after time in Africa and South East Asia as a result of her parents' careers (her mother is an anthropologist), lived in Arizona and Northern Virginia, and now calls Brooklyn home. Her bio is quite the mouthful, so what exactly does Parker do? “I'm trained in the field of conflict resolution, and have worked on race relations on American college campuses and on peace processes in the Arab world, southern Africa, and India,” she says. At Thrive Labs, she helps create transformative gatherings, and she used those learnings to write her book, The Art Of Gathering: How We Meet And Why It Matters. “I followed my passion and natural talents and I made sure to get the skills I didn't have,” she says. Best advice? “Read the newspaper. Develop a craft and set of skills. Gathering is a form of power; learn to bring people together well and intentionally. Seed conversations with your peers about the world. Develop a deeper understanding of structural power. Don't quit your job to plan your wedding—do both.”—Priyanka Khanna 
“I was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, best known for their beef and white people. I now live in Toronto, Ontario, best known for considering itself the only city in Canada,” quips the popular author of One Day We'll All Be Dead And None Of This Will Matter. “It was like the childhoods of many first-generation kids, an education in being different from everyone else, from how I looked to the way my mom talked to me (screaming, usually, as is her wont) to what we ate.” In Koul's trademark humour, she describes life as a writer as a little bit of luck and a big dose of foolishness. “I work really hard and I hate meeting new people, which means I'm a perfect candidate for sitting in front of a computer and writing about the crippling despair that is human existence!” Advice for young millennials looking for a voice? “If anyone is foolishly interested in my advice, it's this: Moisturise, don't start smoking, call your folks and not just when you need money, be nice to yourself, when you realise someone you thought was your friend actually sucks, don't waste time giving them chances. And never, ever get bangs after you get dumped.”—Priyanka Khanna

If out-of-office messages are an indicator of exciting jobs, Simran Sethi's would top the list. Currently, it reads: “I am visiting cocoa farmers in South America and will not be consistently online.” But for Sethi, who was named environmental messenger by Vanity Fair, and is in the process of relocating to Reggio Emilia, Italy, for a book she is writing on Punjabi farmers based in the Po Valley, it's all in a day's work. Sethi, who launched the news department for MTV India in the late '90s, also has the distinction of having spoken on five different continents and lectured at institutions ranging from Harvard University to the Sydney Opera House. She's also the author of Bread, Wine, Chocolate: The Slow Loss Of Foods We Love. “Getting to share the stories of people who are underrepresented,” is what drives her, and she lists a career highlight as “spending time in Ethiopia with the farmers who are sustaining the diversity needed to sustain the coffee crop.” In her quest to tell stories across the world, she's adamant to keep the rest of her life simple. “I travel a lot, so I am now tending toward a capsule collection of black and white blouses and trousers. My friends think it's a little dull but I try to make it interesting with jewellery and other accessories.”—Priyanka Khanna 
“I miss my writer friends in Delhi, my family in Mumbai, Kolkata's bookshops, Chandigarh's rose gardens…,” says Parul Sehgal, who has lived in DC, Manila, Budapest and Delhi. As the book critic at the Gray Lady, she covers fiction and non-fiction, a gig, she says, she got thanks in part to her obsessive reading! What keeps her excited? “I feel the typical answer for a critic is to say the excitement comes from identifying the new—a new voice or some new energy or orientation in the culture. I love that. But the deeper pleasure for me is to come to a writer's defense, to parse the work of someone who might have been misunderstood or dismissed as too difficult or narrow. It's been an honour to write about Mary Gaitskill this way—and Marguerite Duras, Clarice Lispector and Machado de Assis,” she ends.—Priyanka Khanna 
“I had a fraught relationship with my South Asian identity, but have embraced it later in life. I'm very close to my family, and I think that roots are what you identify with, not necessarily your ethnic identity.” It's this frankness that's made Mukhopadhay, who grew up between upstate New York and the city, and started her working life as a volunteer environmental educator at AmeriCorps, a strong voice in the cultural space. Currently the executive editor at Teen Vogue, she honed her skills at Feministing, Mic.com and is also an author. “My two books, keynotes and the young women I meet who are activists and aspiring writers that are inspired by what we do at Teen Vogue... that's the real highlight,” she says, naming Anna Wintour, who she works for, as one of the women she admires.—Priyanka Khanna 
Ranavat's year-old beauty brand is what keeps her anchored to her heritage. “One of the biggest reasons I started Ranavat Botanics was to continue my connection with the country. I was inspired by the beauty of ancient India,” she says. Her commitment to a career in beauty was preceded by a stint at Lehman Brothers, at her father's business and even as an extra in Bollywood films. “My dad is a chemist and my mother an interior designer, so I have both a scientific and creative side,” says Ranavat, whose Indian roots are interspersed not only in her career choices but also her closet—an interesting mix of basics from Everlane and James Perse finished with heirloom-worthy jewellery from Haati Chai. “I love my Haati Chai ‘Anna' coin pendant because it was inspired by the founder's grandmother and looks like the ancient Indian currency. They find this incredible way to blend our heritage into our modern lives.”—Neharika Manjani 
A spiritual pilgrimage to India reminded British-born and -raised Anita Kaushal of the healing powers of India's age-old holistic traditions and provided the inspiration for Mauli Rituals, the organic skin, hair and bodycare brand she founded with her husband in 2014. Hair oils, radiance exfoliants, serums, Himalayan bath salts and lotions are all made harnessing ancient Indian principles that she learnt from her father-in-law, an Ayurvedic doctor. Deeply connected to her Indian roots, Kaushal's brand combines her unique take on two worlds—Ayurveda wisdom and a sense of British refinement. The handcrafted formulas are created in limited batches and are currently stocked in high-end retailers including Space NK, The Conran Shop, Net-a-porter and most recently the Bulgari Hotel Spa in London and Milan. But Kaushal's holistic philosophy runs much deeper than the ingredients in her products—Mauli Rituals donates £1 from every sale to children's charities and dedicates a page on their website to give gratitude to those who helped build the business (including her cleaning lady). Her advice to the younger generation? “Work hard but know that in the end it's work, it's not your life. Don't lose sight of what truly matters.”—Malika Dalamal 
A computer networking degree, jobs in fashion at Holt Renfrew and Levi's, and now an all-natural personal care boutique, The Cure Apothecary, with the goal for each client to love themselves and their skin—Nitasha Goel's career trajectory is unlike any other's. “The Cure Apothecary grew from a passion project—my craving for natural personal care to be easily accessible to everyone. It was hard to find clean, natural beauty products in Toronto, so I took my knowledge from my retail buying background, and sourced the most beautiful natural personal care brands that aligned with my vision.” The brand is only four years old, but Nitasha is conscious of supporting other local businesses and brands in her daily life. Her personal style is a little tomboy with a feminine twist. “On any given day you can find me in high-waisted jeans paired with a bodysuit and denim jacket draped over my shoulders, coincidentally called the Canadian Tuxedo.”—Priyanka Khanna 
“Being able to increase a woman's wages means she invests 90 per cent of it back into her family and community's well-being. We see an immediate improvement in health, education, housing and food for the entire family,” says Janah, who was named among Fortune's Most Promising Entrepreneurs in 2014. The CEO of Samasource and LXMI—two companies that aim to give work to the underprivileged around the world using cutting-edge social enterprise models in technology and luxury skincare respectively—has been strongly influenced by Melinda Gates, American philanthropist and founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Then, in 2017, Penguin Random House published her book Give Work: Reversing Poverty One Job At A Time. “I've learned so much from the communities we serve and source from. Maybe the biggest highlight for me has been living closer to people, plants and nature—we, in the West, are so often trapped in our little boxes of concrete,” says the Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum.—Sheree Gomes Gupta 
If you watched the Oscars last year, you would have spotted an attractive Indian woman walking the red carpet with actor Amy Poehler. The woman in question was UCLA, Harvard and Yale Law School graduate Saru Jayaraman, the founder of Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United. “My parents' struggles with discrimination as immigrants and my classmates' families' struggles as working people and people of colour is what drove me to fight for low-income people of colour nationwide. After 9/11 I founded Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United with restaurant workers displaced from the World Trade Center,” she says about her organisation that's grown to 1,30,000 restaurant workers, restaurant owners and consumers fighting together for better wages and working conditions. It's mobilising and elevating the voices of these workers that is the most exciting part of her job. When President Trump tried to pass a law making tips the property of owners, 4,00,000 restaurant workers fought back and won a bipartisan bill. “The attention my work has received over the last year thanks to the Times Up movement and other high-profile events I was invited to forced me to go shopping,” she says about how life has changed. “My good friend, actor and activist Jane Fonda, was kind enough to share some fashion pointers. At the end of the day, I want my clothes to be forgettable; I only want my voice lifting up women, especially women of colour, and my work to be remembered.”—Priyanka Khanna

Let's take a minute to trace Ghosh's career trajectory. She graduated from Oxford University with a Master's in Economics, interned on the 37th floor of the United Nations during Kofi Annan's tenure as secretary general, and currently leads the international policy team for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It's a résumé that would stand out in even the heftiest stack. “One of my personal career highlights is working with Gavi, the global alliance for immunisation. We raised four billion dollars for life-saving vaccines around the world!” she says. With a mother from Darjeeling and father from Kolkata, Ghosh recalls a childhood shaped by holidays to India. Today her travel-intensive role continues to take her back to the country, commanding a closet that's adaptive to adventures. “I can be in India or rural Africa one week and a London boardroom the next. I'm also a mom of two kids. So, I need a wardrobe that's functional and flexible.”—Neharika Manjani 
Last year, London saw its first mass protest for making the conversation around periods stigma-free. The 19-year-old Cambridge student behind mobilising 2,000 millennials via her #FreePeriods movement describes the scene: “We braved the December chill, holding banners with the cleverest period puns, to collectively shout for change.” Soon after, the government pledged to give a portion of the tampon tax fund to tackle period poverty, and in October she was recognised by the United Nations and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. A personal highlight, though: sneaking a selfie with Ed Sheeran and meeting Emmanuel Macron! Her inspiration and also her conduit to feeling connected to her roots (apart from polishing off a bowl of Kerala fish curry) is her great grandmother's legacy as a women's rights advocate. Her message to others from the Insta-generation? “Don't be afraid to be disruptive. We have the best tool at our disposal—social media. Why not use it to see the change we want?”—Akanksha Kamath

“My career path is more of a jungle gym than a ladder,” explains Geneva-born, New York-based Nahema Mehta. She's referring to her stints on Wall Street, Sotheby's and even the Supreme Court of the US. In her free time Mehta also managed to launch Art Remba, a “Net-a-Porter for the art world.” This venture caught the attention of vodka giant Absolut, who bought her out and led her to co-found Absolut Art, a globally curated artist-to-consumer e-commerce site. “I wanted to address the art-buying gap between posters and Picassos,” explains Mehta. Her work takes her around the world, from Hong Kong to Sweden and everything in between—a familiar feeling from her childhood years, when she shuttled between Belgium and Kenya. For her travels she swears by Maria Cornejo wrinkle-proof jumpsuits that look good enough for a meeting after a long-haul flight. She also packs Brunello Cucinelli separates, Prada metallic brogues and Anamika Khanna for post-8pm events.—Rishna Shah 
The year 2018 saw Ganesh work on two large-scale projects. The Scorpion Gesture, a suite of animations commissioned by the Rubin Museum of Art in New York, was transformed into an immersive installation for the 2018 Kochi-Muziris Biennale. The second, a multi-part print project inspired by Sultana's Dream, a feminist utopian text written in 1905, culminated in a solo exhibition, Chitra Ganesh: Her Garden, A Mirror. “I draw inspiration from a variety of visual languages, from Surrealism and Expressionism to Islamic architecture, comics and sci-fi,” she says.—Sheree Gomes Gupta

“The closest thing to home for me is food and films,” says Devina Seth, who opened her second restaurant with husband Harneet Baweja in London this August. “The first Gunpowder we started was in Spitalfields, where we upcycled an old ‘curry house' and opened shop in 2015.” Beyond moonlighting as a consultant at her husband's restaurant, Seth is a publishing marketing magnet. She spent six years at Vice, where she witnessed the team grow from 40 to 500, and now as the future of print comes under speculation, she finds herself at the Dazed group, testing and integrating new products for online. The dress code her job demands? “I always ask myself: How would Phoebe Philo want me to dress? So, I go clean and understated—smoking jackets, overcoats, a few well-cut suits and a lot of shirts. I reserve my smock dresses for date night with my husband at the restaurant.—Akanksha Kamath 
When Garima Arora opened GAA in Bangkok in April 2017, little did she imagine that in less than two years it would be awarded a Michelin star. Before opening her own restaurant, she worked at the legendary Noma in Copenhagen. “My biggest takeaway from Noma was to tap into my own culture. To see them do amazing things with such limited produce they have in Scandinavia was eyeopening,” says Arora. The nouvelle cuisine at GAA doesn't fit any label—Thai produce, Indian flavours, and international techniques come together to create unexpected plates. Arora runs a packed dinner service seven nights a week, so her wardrobe is primarily her chef uniform. “When I do take a day off, I just want to be as comfortable as possible. My personal style is very casual; I basically live in jeans and sneakers outside the kitchen,” she says.—Prachi Joshi

Abhishek Bachchan's closest family members and friends have taken to Instagram to wish the star on his 43rd birthday. See all the sweetest posts, including the adorable throwback that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan posted, now 
February 5, 2019 marks Abhishek Bachchan's 43rd birthday, and on the actor's big day, wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was one of the first to post a sweet celebratory post on social media. In case you haven't checked it out yet, Rai Bachchan brought in her husband's birthday with a mini album that included a picture of him as a toddler, and a snapshot of the couple together.

It comes as no surprise that the Instagram post has earned itself more than 440,000 likes in just 12 hours. 
As it turns out, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan wasn't the only family member to share some birthday love with Abhishek Bachchan.

Apart from his family members, Abhishek Bachchan has also been receiving well wishes from his friends from the Indian film fraternity today, along with fans from around the world. While John Abraham wished the actor with an unmissable Dostana meme, Vicky Kaushal shared an adorable picture of himself giving Bachchan a kiss on the cheek and director Farah Khan Kunder pulled up a super sweet photograph of herself hugging Bachchan too.

Priyanka Chopra's second stint on The Ellen Show had her revealing some big Hollywood film plans, details about her role in Isn't It Romantic, and why her mother was upset about her wedding with Nick Jonas 
Yesterday, Priyanka Chopra appeared on The Ellen Show for the second time, and everyone who's waiting for what next from the star was in for a treat. For starters, the Bollywood-slash-Hollywood crossover star disclosed that she's developing a film adaptation of the hugely successful six-part Netflix docuseries, Wild Wild Country. In fact, Chopra's not just going to star in the film, she revealed that she's producing it as well. The Emmy-winning Netflix series is based on the life of the controversial cult leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (aka Osho), who built a utopian city in the Oregon desert that led to a mammoth conflict with the locals and further escalated into a national scandal. Chopra's film, on the other hand, will be a narrative of Osho's highly influential personal secretary, Ma Anand Sheela. A former spokeswoman of the Rajneesh movement (aka Osho movement), Sheela was convicted of multiple counts of attempted murder, and also served time for the same. 
Recently, Chopra shed some more light on her upcoming role as Ma Anand Sheela, saying “I have to credit director Barry Levinson for bringing this movie to me. He will be directing the project. He and his producers have been researching on this subject and developing it for the last few years. He approached me to develop it with him.” But she also mentioned that the movie will come out "way in the future". 
The 36-year-old actor also dished the details about her Valentine's Day rom-com release Isn't It Romantic. An American-Australian satirical comedy film, it's directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson and stars Rebel Wilson, Liam Hemsworth, Adam DeVine along with Chopra. In case you were wondering, the film follows a woman who, after getting hit on the head, wakes up in a world where everything around her plays out like a romantic comedy film. Chopra's character in the Hollywood movie, she revealed, is a yoga ambassador. 
“For an Indian family and an Indian wedding, it was small for sure,” quipped Priyanka Chopra when Elle DeGeneres spoke of Chopra's nuptials with Nick Jonas as “a huge wedding. We all saw pictures, it was like the royal wedding or something.” Spotted in a sexy hemline Vivienne Westwood midi dress and Jimmy Choo slingbacks, Chopra made her second appearance on the popular American talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show almost immediately after hosting her fourth reception in North Carolina, America. Chopra's first interview on the show was in 2016, also marking the first Bollywood actor to make an appearance on the show. 
Priyanka Chopra's beautiful two-ceremony-long, multi-day wedding in Jodhpur to musician Nick Jonas caught the fancy of millions around the world, DeGeneres included. This is why the host started the show by congratulating her before specifically inquiring about the number of guests present at the nuptials. Chopra revealed that her 200-guest wedding was “super intimate” (versus an archetypical Indian wedding with a guest list of a 1,000+) and included “mostly family because both of us have giant families.” This small-scale wedding idea apparently upset Chopra's mother, who desired inviting several of her extended family and friends, including her jeweller and hairdresser. 
Chopra's mother wasn't the only one upset about the wedding—during the show, DeGeneres also playfully asked Chopra why she wasn't on the list, since she was Jonas' former landlord. The sassy actor, known for her witty repartee when teased, jokingly replied that they were “so offended that you didn't even respond to our invite though.” Ellen got her a wedding gift—a stunning photo frame with a picture of her, Chopra and Jonas' past appearances on the show. 
Watch the exchange below. 
Chopra disclosed that both of them didn't know much about each other. "I actually didn't know much about them. I mean, everybody knew the Jonas Brothers. I just didn't know the music. I knew some of the songs." As for how this romance came about, she recalled the moment where Nick slid into her Twitter DMs. 
The newly-wed also went on to talk about her husband, "He's nice. It shocks me how he hasn't been corrupted—you know when you're in entertainment such a long time," she said. "He's so family-driven, about his parents, he's just really nice and sweet."

Ekta Kapoor is now a mother to a little boy. Just like her brother Tusshar Kapoor, the entrepreneur had her first child via surrogacy 
January 27, 2019 marked the beginning of a new journey for producer and director Ekta Kapoor, who has had a son. Kapoor is now a proud mother to a healthy baby boy, and her closest are all set to welcome the new member of their family home. According to reports, Kapoor has had plans to become a parent for a while now, and just like brother Tusshar Kapoor, chose to do so via surrogacy. She is also an aunt to one-year-old Laksshya Kapoor, Tusshar Kapoor's son, and if you follow her on Instagram, you may already know that Kapoor loves spending time with the toddler. In fact, she also spoke out about how the arrival of Laksshya has impacted her in 2018, saying, “My life has changed. If there's anything that's most important in my life [now], then that's Laksshya. Every day, he does something new and we all look forward to that. I miss him every time I'm travelling on work. You know, the lakshya (target) of my life now is to look after Laksshya.” 
Amongst the many personalities who have already begun congratulating Ekta Kapoor on social media are filmmaker Hansal Mehta, who has worked with the producer in the past on Bose – Dead/Alive. Mehta broke the news online when he tweeted “Many congratulations and lots of love dearest Ekta Kapoor. Welcome to parenthood and joy”.

Featuring reflective glasses, framed artworks and purple lights, Alia Bhatt's new vanity van is one every millennial would approve of. 
With three upcoming movies, actor Alia Bhatt has been keeping very busy lately and on the personal front, has also been making some big investments. Just last week, the actor reportedly bought herself a 2,300 square foot apartment in Juhu to celebrate her recent spree of successes, and it looks like she's also recently treated herself by giving her "moving home" aka her vanity van a fun new makeover. And who better than interior designer Gauri Khan to give Bhatt's space a new look? After all, Khan is also responsible for elevating the looks of Sidharth Malhotra, Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar's residences, and is a favourite amongst Bollywood's cool crew. The actor took to her official Instagram page recently to share a glimpse of her trailer with her fans. Here's a look. 
All geometrically divided reflective glasses panels, party-ready purple lights, and classic wooden flooring, the interiors of Alia Bhatt's new and improved trailer are everything a millennial on-the-go could ask for. The star clearly has a taste for artworks featuring rustic, vintage books. In stark contrast to the party lights inside her trailer sits a framed art piece that shows half-read books piled onto one another, giving the young, sleek trailer more depth. Missed it? Here's a closer look. 
What makes this little detail from Alia Bhatt's vanity van so interesting is that the actor has a similar piece of art in the bedroom of the Juhu apartment she shares with sister Shaheen Bhatt. In case you've never checked it out, the Bhatt sisters' loft-style home is full of Pinterest-worthy corners, sit-and-you-sink-into-them couches, and playful textured walls. One of Bhatt's favourite elements from her bedroom is this painting, divided across the pages of several books. Haven't taken a tour of her home yet? Get going here. 
On the work front, Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh have got movie buffs all over the country waiting with bated breath for their next project, Gully Boy. Most recently, Bhatt shared the following sneak peek from the film, and one can expect to see her at several promotional outings until February 14, when Gully Boy hits theatres. 
And that's not all! Alia Bhatt has two more movies lined up for the near future: period drama Kalank (rumoured to release this Apil) will see the star working alongside Madhuri Dixit Nene, Sonakshi Sinha, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanjay Dutt, and Brahmastra will see her sharing screen space with beau Ranbir Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan.

Ruchika Parab of Oblique Studio has launched a new campaign that places light on the disparity of women football players in India 
Growing up, I enjoyed playing sports—I dabbled in basketball, lawn tennis, badminton, and then was slowly attracted to football. Even at a young age of 15, I was shocked by the sheer lack of girls who were interested in learning the sport. After playing football for a couple of months, I unfortunately had to withdraw from my morning training sessions because a) the school had no interest in forming a girls' football team; b) the girls who trained with me had stopped showing up; c) the boys wouldn't allow a lone girl to play with them. 
Sadly, 10 years later, the scenario remains unchanged. Girls shy away from sports like football and cricket, because of a lack of equal representation and the stereotype that they can't play in the first place, when they actually can. Turning the tables in our favour is Ruchika Parab, co-founder and creative director of Oblique Studio, whose latest campaign ‘A Girl's Place' tackles the underrepresentation of women in sporting communities—starting with football. 
Parab explains that the campaign—part of the O.R.B movement that works as a platform for activism to create an equal society—is an attempt to reclaim what it means to be a girl. “A Girl's Place challenges the idea that women are allowed participation only in certain spheres, and this was the starting premise of the campaign,” she adds. For its first phase, Parab has collaborated with the Force Goa Foundation, which is actively working to raise the standard of football in Goa right from the grassroot level, with a special focus on girls. 
The proceeds that will be raised through the sale of merchandise and events will all be used for a good cause. “We plan to use the proceeds to develop the Under 6, Under 8 and Under 10 girl's leagues and build better infrastructure for the game, provide women coaches and physiotherapists as well as improve nutrition, mental health and create gender awareness,” says Parab. 
“Our National Women's Football team just had two back-to-back wins against Hong Kong, but it didn't make a lot of news. If you watch the Under 8 girls' team play, you will be surprised. The point of this campaign is to bring the stories, the struggles and the victories to the forefront, and to ultimately reach a point where a female football player is recognised as just a football player,” says Parab.

Did you know that this is what Prince Harry calls Kate Middleton? 
British royal names can be a doozy. Take William Arthur Philip Louis or Elizabeth Alexandra Mary or even Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David. No matter how much blue blood flows through your veins, no one, no one, is throwing out a multi-moniker like that in casual conversation, which is where royal nicknames come in. 
Sure, there's the obvious—Will for William or Harry for Henry. But behind closed doors, the Windsors get a little more creative. 
Kate Middleton, for example, is called “Catherine” in public. However, the British tabloids report that her brother-in-law Prince Harry calls her “Cath.” 
At an appearance in 2012, the Duchess revealed that growing up, she was called “Squeak.” 
Prince William, too, had an adorable childhood nickname: Wombat, given to him by Princess Diana. In a 2007 interview with NBC, however, he admitted it's somehow stuck with him into adulthood. “I can't get rid of it now,” he said. “It began when I was two. I've been rightfully told because I can't remember back that far, but when we went to Australia with our parents, and the wombat, you know, that's the local animal, so I just basically got called that, not because I look like a wombat, or maybe I do.” 
Prince Harry, according to his brother, has got “plenty” of pet names. They range from a bit on-the-nose (Ginger) to the obscure (Spike, which is also suspected to be his former Facebook alter ego). Yet most of them the world will likely never know: “Most of them I can't call in front of here,” William told NBC when asked. “ You know, [they're] a bit rude.” 
Prince Charles is also rumoured to call Meghan Markle “Tungsten” due to her strength, reports the Daily Mail, while Vanity Fair reports that the 37-year-old duchess has been nicknamed “Di 2” at the Palace. A source said: “I've heard the duchess is referred to as Di 2, because of the similarities to Harry's mother. It's meant affectionately, and I think it's quite true—they are rather alike.” 
Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, though, have pet names that are certainly safe for work: Hello! reports they call each other Fred and Gladys. 
But perhaps the queen of all royal nicknames belongs to, well, Queen Elizabeth II herself. Famously called “Lilibet” growing up and by her close friends and family, she's managed to accrue several more during her reign. Prince Philip calls her “Cabbage” (and, some claim, “Sausage”). As a child, Prince William was unable to say “Granny”—so he called her “Gary,” according to the Daily Mail. 
In the documentary Our Queen at 90, Kate Middleton said that Prince George calls the Queen “Gan-Gan.” How's that for a royal title? 
As for Prince George's own nickname, a dog walker's recent encounter with the young royal has lead people to believe it may be Archie. 
While out for a walk in Berkshire with his grandmother Carole Middleton, the five-year-old stopped to pet a dog. The dog walker then revealed to The Sun that, "Just to be friendly I engaged in a bit of small talk and I asked George what his name was, even though obviously I knew it." 
"To my astonishment he said ‘I'm called Archie' with a big smile on his face," she added. "I don't know why he calls himself Archie but kids often play with their names and I think it's lovely."

Kareena Kapoor Khan and sister-in-law Soha Ali Khan Pataudi discussed their kids Taimur Ali Khan and Inaaya Naumi Kemmu on Kapoor Khan's radio show 'What Women Want', and it's a must-watch for all moms 
Kareena Kapoor Khan isn't just a Bollywood superstar. The 38-year-old actor is also a mom of one, an icon to many, and a radio show host too. In case you haven't been tracking her of late, Kapoor Khan now connects with her fans via What Women Want, an Ishq FM talk show that has her discussing issues faced by women in India, and also aims to break barriers and stereotypes women battle on a daily basis. So far, the star has sat down to chat with several note-worthy names for the show, including Sunny Leone, her Veere Di Wedding co-star Swara Bhasker, sister Karisma Kapoor, designer Manish Malhotra and BFF Amrita Arora Ladak, amongst others. But if you're a mother yourself (or just a Taimur Ali Khan fan), you need to check out the most recent episode of What Women Want. 
For her latest on-air chat, Kareena Kapoor Khan was joined by a film personality who plays an important role in her life: sister-in-law Soha Ali Khan Pataudi. "Meri aaj ki guest has recently delivered do-do bachche [My guest today has delivered two kids]," Kapoor Khan said, "Jisme se ek hai meri super cute niece Inaaya, aur doosri hai ek 256 page book [of which one is my super cute niece Inaaya, and the second is a 256 page book]." Married to Kunal Kemmu, Pataudi is often spotted out and about with Kareena and Saif Ali Khan, and has a daughter of her own who often spends play dates with Taimur. During the show, the sisters-in-law discussed what it's like to be moms in the digital age, with the paparazzi following their children's every move. "I know that as a parent, I am extremely worried," Kapoor Khan revealed while talking to Pataudi, who responded saying, "I think Taimur is perhaps a more extreme case than Inaaya. He's often followed to wherever he goes... I don't know what it is about these particular children that people have taken an interest in, but it is, I'm sure, going to take away from their innocence." 
Another interesting point that most mothers will be able to relate to from Kareena Kapoor Khan and Soha Ali Khan Pataudi's conversation was the pressure that comes with constantly wanting to keep one's child entertained. "Saif keeps telling me, 'What is the need to constantly entertain your child?'" Kapoor Khan said on the show. "'Why does it have to be that has to go out every day? He doesn't need to be the centre of the world all the time.'" From Pataudi's point of view, it's also important to ensure that one's child doesn't get it all from an early age, an opinion that her brother Saif Ali Khan also shares with her. "I know that she loves being on swings, and I said I want to get her a swing. And that's when [Kunal] said, 'Okay, look. I don't want her to have everything, even if you can afford it. She should also look forward to going to Taimur's house because he has a swing.'" 
The conversation also had the actors reveal snippets from Soha and Saif Ali Khan's childhood, and how they were raised. If you haven't checked it out yet, scroll below for a peek at Kareena Kapoor Khan and Soha Ali Khan's talk.

From nepotism to casting calls, self-made actors Bhumi Pednekar and Rajkummar Rao share their journey into the mainstream spotlight on this week's episode of Koffee with Karan 
“When will we see you play rich characters onscreen?” a fan quips almost immediately after Bhumi Pednekar and Rajkummar Rao settle on the couch on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan. While Rao brushed it off with, “Only when Karan Johar will cast us in his movies,” the innocuous question does provide food for thought. Dressed in a diametrically opposite monochrome palette of black and white, Pednekar and Rao's journeys couldn't be more similar. Without the glamour of a glitzy launch vehicle or a starry legacy to propel them into mainstream, they have made their mark by picking humble roles that allowed their prodigious talent to shine. If you missed their candid chat with Johar about life on the other side of the fence, here are all the highlights you need to know about. 
The Lust Stories star admitted, "When you start a new journey, it is going to be alien at first but people are very accepting, I never felt out of place. I have always felt wanted and my work has been appreciated. I go to these parties and people give me so much love. So it's been pretty good for us," while Rao divulged, "When I was looking for work after Love Sex Aur Dhokha, there was not really a lot of work. Probably, if I was an insider, people would have pushed me. After giving two back-to-back successful films, I was still doing smaller parts." Johar went on to neatly tie their perspectives together with, "Nepotism or not, eventually, talent is what rocks.” 
Despite the string of celebrity weddings that took centerstage in 2018, Rao revealed that he isn't ready to take the plunge yet with girlfriend, Patralekha. “We are in a very happy relationship, and our parents are not complaining, so there is no pressure to get married. And I think both of us are just busy in our respective careers,” he said and went on to add that she does, however, warn him about his co-stars. “There have been times she has said, ‘Dekho, zara isse sambhal ke rehna'. I think it's a great thing when your partner is your best friend. You can share everything—you can have fun, dance, sing, go out to watch a film. It's not about those lovey-dovey talks. It's about discussing everything in life,” he added with a smile. 
Before she booked a berth in Bollywood with her nuanced performance in Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Pednekar was already a part of the film fraternity as an assistant to casting director, Shanoo Sharma. Her job involved auditioning some big names, including Ranveer Singh, Parineeti Chopra, Disha Patani, and even Rao himself. While she found the latter's performance fine, she wasn't really taken with Patani as she was still very raw. However, she admitted that Chopra was the one who truly impressed her with her audition for Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. 
As an assistant to one of the biggest casting directors in the industry, Pednekar was among the first people on the job for Dum Laga Ke Haisha. “As this script came along, I didn't know they were auditioning me. So, Shanoo being Shanoo, she's said, ‘Oh my God! Let's do this mock audition.' She gave me four scenes to do and I did all of them back-to-back together. I guess when Sharat Katariya, my director from the movie, kind of liked my work, they told me, ‘Oh, you know what, it wasn't a mock audition. We were actually auditioning you.' Shanoo is a very dramatic person, so when we had a fight, she was like, ‘You are fired!' I was like, ‘What? Over such a silly thing?' and then she said, ‘From today, I don't want to see your face because you're being considered for Dum Laga Ke Haisha.'” Pednekar reminisced. 
Having made her mark with rustic roles in Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Shubh Mangal Savdhaan, she admits that people are confused when they see her speaking English or shedding the weight from her debut movie. However, the actor considers it an accomplishment that she was able to make herself so believable in those characters that people can't separate her from her roles.

At the Umang show last night, Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor appeared hand-in-hand, Ranveer Singh got picked up by the police (literally) and Karisma Kapoor caught up with her Bollywood colleagues. Read ahead for all the Bollywood highlights from the evening 
It's January again and in India, that means Bollywood's red carpet season is back in full swing. This weekend, the stars came together for the annual Umang Mumbai Police Show, an event that gives the Indian film industry's favourite faces a chance to treat Mumbai's policemen with special performances as a thank you for their services. Given that the Umang Police Show has always boasted an envy-worthy guest list, it comes as no surprise that 2019's edition too was attended by a long list of celebrities. Here's a look at everything you missed from the star-studded evening. 
Though 2019's Umang Mumbai Police Show was attended by many of Bollywood's biggest stars, the duo that everyone was talking about was Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor, who walked in looking picture-perfect hand-in-hand. In case you haven't been following these two, Bhatt and Kapoor first made headlines when they attended Sonam Kapoor Ahuja's wedding reception together back in 2018, and come May 2018, Ranbir Kapoor also went on record and confirmed his relationship with the 25-year-old star, saying “It's really new right now, and I don't want to over speak. It needs time to breathe and it needs space”. While Bhatt smiled for the cameras in a mint green Tarun Tahiliani anarkali at the Umang show (styled with pretty chandbalis and romantic waves), Kapoor stood by her in a classic suit. Here's a look at one of the couple's cutest pictures from the evening.

2019's Umang Mumbai Police Show was brimming with stars, some of whom also took over the stage with unforgettable performances. Joining Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor at the celebration were the likes of Katrina Kaif, Shah Rukh Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Kriti Sanon, Ranveer Singh, Janhvi Kapoor, Sara Ali Khan, Vicky Kaushal, Saif Ali Khan, Akshay Kumar, Kartik Aaryan, Sushant Singh Rajput, Ayushmann Khurrana, Taapsee Pannu and Ajay Devgn. Joining them were Sachin and Anjali Tendulkar, Shilpa Shetty Kundra, Vaani Kapoor, Aamir Khan, Anil Kapoor, Fatima Sana Sheikh, Shraddha Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Tabu, John Abraham and Parineeti Chopra. Some of the most exciting looks of the evening included Katrina Kaif's fiery red sari, Ranveer Singh's daring animal print suit and Karisma Kapoor's romantic pastel pink number. 
Just like the years before this, 2019's Umang Mumbai Police Show featured some very exciting performances. While Ranveer Singh danced for the audience in an iridescent jacket, Alia Bhatt joined Ranbir Kapoor and Shah Rukh Kan on stage, and Akshay Kumar transformed into a police officer himself for his performance. The highlight of the evening, however, was when Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan addressed the guests from the stage. Sitting front row, Karisma Kapoor caught up with Urmila Matondkar and Tabu while they watched the best moments from the evening. Between performances, the stars also made sure to meet members of the Mumbai police force.

To celebrate her recent successes, reports say Alia Bhatt has treated herself to a brand new apartment in Mumbai 
Fresh off her success (both critically and monetarily) with film Raazi in 2018, it looks like Alia Bhatt has made a big purchase decision this week. According to some news reports, the actor has recently bought a 2,300sqft apartment in Juhu, Mumbai, on the first floor of a high rise for Rs 13.11 crores, apparently double the asking price (which was Rs 7.86 crores). Since the price she paid was way higher than what the flat was worth, she paid a hefty duty to secure the place, but according to real estate agents, the price is well within the general limits of the neighbourhood and building, so it isn't too out of the ordinary. Bhatt has been investing heavily in properties as she continues her meteoric success, as this will reportedly be her third home in Juhu. 
Bhatt currently lives in an apartment in the Mumbai neighbourhood with her sister, Shaheen Bhatt. Her home is clearly an extension of her bubbly personality—what with the white-washed walls, cheeky posters, pendant lights and tea bar which make it the best entertaining space. The two sisters chose a New York-style loft with large, wide windows that verdant views. Designed by interior designer Richa Bahl, Bhatt's home is cosy and functional, with a girly, fun vibe. Since the two are fans of reading, there is a large bookcase and plush sofas for Bhatt to sink her teeth into new scripts, and for their cats to play on as well. With two new properties to plan for and design, we're sure that Bhatt will keep things fresh and exciting in her new Mumbai pad as well. 
Bhatt is having an exciting beginning to 2019. She spent New Year's with her boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor in New York, and then got busy promoting her upcoming film Gully Boy with Ranveer Singh. Last year, her film Raazi joined the 100 crore club (it made 120 crores and proved to be one of the highest-grossing Hindi films featuring a female protagonist,) and Bhatt's upcoming lineup is looking enviable as well. She will appear in period drama Kalank alongside Madhuri Dixit, Sonakshi Sinha, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapur, and Sanjay Dutt and sci-fi flick Brahmastra with her beau Ranbir Kapoor, and Amitabh Bachchan.

See what the stars wore to the 25th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards 
Another day, another incredible awards season red carpet. This time, it's the 25th Annual SAG Awards held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California on Sunday January 27 (Monday, January 28 here in Australia). The SAG Awards celebrate the very best over the past year in film and television and are a real favourite of Hollywood actors and actresses because these awards are voted on by their acting peers. 
This year the awards are being hosted by Will & Grace's Megan Mullally who is certain to bring her light comedic touch to a fun awards ceremony. Mullally is only the second host of the SAG Awards, The Good Place's Kristen Bell made SAG Awards history in 2018 by becoming the very first host of the awards show. Before 2018, the awards, which began in 1995, did not have a host. 
As for the red carpet, this year's SAG Awards red carpet had a twist: instead of traditional red, it was silver in celebration of the fact that it's the 25th Annual SAG Awards—silver being the traditional anniversary token to commemorate a 25th anniversary. The silver provided the perfect foil for everyone's favourite celebrities to walk the red carpet in true Tinseltown style including sartorial silver carpet highs from Netflix's Glow Alison Brie in Miu Miu, Lady Gaga in Christian Dior haute couture, direct from Dior's spring 2019 haute couture runway show, and Margot Robbie in Chanel. 
Cast members from A Star Is Born, Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians, The Handmaid's Tale, Bohemian Rhapsody, This Is Us and The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel also walked the 2019 Screen Actors Guild Awards silver carpet, taking the metallic theme to heart wearing shimmering sequinned gowns and suits, including Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding in an eye-catching rose gold Tom Ford jacket. 
The SAG Awards are one of the more relaxed, real ‘industry' awards and the celebrity red carpet reflected this with an anything goes attitude that saw plunging necklines, feathered detailing, crystals, jewels and oversized bows on display.

“We set great store by power, wealth, success and fame, the goals that await us at the end of our successful endeavours.

The real magic lies in what you do with them to a greater end,” writes Priya Tanna, editor-in-chief, Vogue India, in her editor's letter for our upcoming February issue. 
The positive impact one creates—whether for one person, an entire community, or the world at large—lies at the core of the Vogue India's February 2019 issue. All around us, people are shaping the world around us in constructive ways, either by giving, using their influence or by making choices that have far-reaching consequences, and this forms the basis of our next read, which is focused on the theme of Impact. Our changemakers span everyone from a lawyer-activist spearheading the world's biggest beach clean-up to a popular actor starting a crowdfunding website, and we also explore the impact of choice on the career trajectories of our favourite creatives, delving into how seemingly small decisions went a long way in real life.

The young lovebirds may remain determined to keep the details of their relationship under wraps, but Alia Bhatt’s Instagram PDA with the Kapoor family is hard to miss 
It should come as little surprise that fate conspired to bring Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor together, given that she had already predicted their union years ago. Perched on the famous Koffee with Karan couch in 2014, a young 21-year-old Bhatt asserted with a touch of her signature confidence, “I have hung out with him, and I still think he is really adorable. And I still want to marry him.” Five years and a few relationships later, the two found their way to each other amidst multiple hush-hush sightings and speculation. Finally ending the suspense, Kapoor made things official in an interview last year, but the happy couple remains determined to keep their new love under the radar. Since nothing escapes the discerning microscope of the internet, here's a gallery of pictures of their happiest moments together. 
After a few paparazzi sightings at social events, the duo was spotted at secret dinner dates all about town, adding fuel to the gossip. Despite their collective hectic schedules, Bhatt could be seen making the most of date nights in breezy separates and an elusive smile, as she marched in and out of restaurants ahead of Kapoor. If things weren't official yet, the scenic backdrop of Bulgaria at their upcoming project together, Brahmāstra, helped seal the deal. Away from the prying eyes of the paps, the alleged couple let their guard down, with Bhatt occasionally taking to Instagram to drop some hints. 
The summer of 2018 saw Sonam K Ahuja tying the knot with longtime beau, Anand Ahuja, in a grand extravaganza, and all the love in the air inspired the Bhatt and Kapoor to make their own couple debut on the red carpet. In a sea of reds and golds, Alia Bhatt made heads turn in a lime green Sabyasachi lehenga, with a dapper Ranbir Kapoor complementing her in a stately white kurta. 
In a scene that could have been scripted straight out of the romcoms she's famous for, the Raazi stunner took time out from her packed schedule to bake a birthday cake for her beau, before sharing a rare candid image of him on Instagram with the caption, “Happy birthday sunshine.” Determined to make his 36th birthday special, the young star laboured over a vanilla bean cake baked from scratch too. 
Famously known for being a tight-knit group, the Kapoor clan has already accepted Bhatt as one of their own. Even before the couple made their relationship official, the young 25-year-old could be spotted bonding with Neetu Kapoor, with their Instagram PDA soon rivalling other celebrity couples'. Case in point: Closeted on the sets of Brahmāstra, Neetu Kapoor dropped by along with Bhatt's closest friends to help make her 25th birthday special. The meet-the-parents soon progressed to Soni Razdan and Neetu Kapoor teaming up for special lunches in the city, often accompanied by a glowing Bhatt. Amidst whispers of wedding plans, the happy couple flew to New York to bring in 2019 with Kapoor's entire family. There was plenty of Christmas cheer to go around as Bhatt joined the clan for festive lunches and candid family photos in the wee hours of the dawn. Neetu Kapoor shared images from the holiday and dubbed her as one of her “heartbeats” in an Instagram post, even as sister Riddhima Kapoor Sahni dropped some heart emojis for Bhatt in the comments below. 
While the jury is still out on whether the couple plans on taking their relationship to the next level, with the blessing of the entire extended family, we might just have another celebrity wedding on our hands soon.

Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja’s life makes for a modern day fairy-tale, documented in selfies, shoefies and everything in between 
Everyday is indeed phenomenal when you are Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja—one, the torchbearer of the Kapoor family legacy and an acclaimed sartorial savant; the other, a die-hard sneakerhead, businessman and scion of a prestigious family. Together, they have been putting their self-appointed moniker, #EverydayPhenomenal to good use, filling every moment with memories and happiness. From taking in haute couture from international front rows to heading backstage for goofy selfies, to scouting for vegetarian restaurants in Los Angeles in their downtime, it is impossible not to smile at the updates the actor keeps putting out on her Instagram. For those looking for proof that cupid does exist, here's a look at the Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja's most adorable moments together. 
If your inner celebrity voyeur was deprived of a ringside view at Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's hush-hush wedding, the summery extravaganza that was Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja's nuptials likely came as a relief. In keeping with the larger-than-life movies she stars in onscreen, every frame and stolen paparazzi photo had the couple radiant with happiness. 
When you are the reigning fashionista of Bollywood, honeymoon comes in the form of a stroll down the Cannes Riviera with Hollywood A-listers. With both hands decked in mehandi, the Neerja actor took to the Cannes 2018 red carpet with husband Anand waiting supportingly in the wings. “Anand is so encouraging when it comes to my work that he didn't even blink when I told him I was flying to Cannes two days after the wedding, or that I was getting into promotions straightaway. There was no argument, just acceptance,” she recalled in a post on Instagram. 
Upon her return back to town, one of her close friends and socialite Natasha Poonawalla helped the happy couple unwind in the only way they know how—with a star-studded bash at her palatial Mumbai pad. Dressed in a sweeping midnight blue gown by Sophie et Voilà, Kapoor Ahuja's face was happily lit up as posed for the lens with her dapper husband. 
The best chapter of your life only just begins after marriage, and further proof to the fact that the celebrity couple is living their best life together can be found in the frequent PDA in their collective Instagram feeds. From sharing an adorable kiss before heading out the door for an event, to posting a whirlwind tour of their top moments together on his birthday, their signature #EverydayPhenomenal hashtag has been put dextrously to use. 
A regular feature on the international fashion circuit, September had Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja gaining some major sartorial cred on the front row at the Armani show in Milan, which included scoring face time with the legendary designer Giorgio Armani himself. Dressed in a monochrome gown with a plunging neckline, the actor layered up with a blazer for the occasion, while Anand suited up. All the makings of a power couple, yes? 
And the whirlwind roulette continued, as Ahuja took to the Business of Fashion Voices summit for a special conversation with founder Imran Amed. Helping her chart this milestone moment was her husband, who ensured that there were plenty of smiles to go around. “My better half and my biggest support. Thanks for always having my back,” she raved on Instagram. 
The grand Kapoor family Diwali found a different setting last year with the gorgeous city of London forming the backdrop. Spread over the better part of the festive weekend, the entire clan and their better halves pencilled in a visit to the Victoria Palace Theatre for a special showing of the musical, Hamilton. “The plan is to fan this spark into a flame,” quoted sister Rhea Kapoor on Instagram. 
To wrap up the year, the happy couple found themselves a cosy love nest in Bali. Surrounded by the lush landscape of COMO Shambhala Estate, the duo ushered in 2019 with smiles and selfies, while the actor reflected upon the year that was. “The end of the year always brings up thoughts about the future and calls for a little reminiscing as well! I've chosen 18 of my favourite, most special moments from 2018. Moments of love, celebration, laughter, family and art; moment that have made this year what it was! Thank you 2018,” she said along with a collage of her favourite memories of the year. 
With the hype building up around her upcoming project, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, the actor snuck away for a quick trip to Los Angeles with her beau in recent times. The duo have been hitting the top cultural spots in the city, including hanging out with Vidya Vox at the iconic F.R.I.E.N.D.S Cafe, followed by date night at the Last Bookstore. The cherry on the proverbial cake? The couple ran into Mindy Kaling at the Lakers game, with Anand obligingly heading behind the camera to capture his wife's fangirl moment for posterity. Scroll through our gallery to take a look at Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja's cutest moments together till date.

One day before we relive Jhansi ki Rani, Rani Lakshmibai’s life through Kangana Ranaut’s biopic, Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, releasing tomorrow, we chronicle every fact about her that you may have not heard of 
Powerful female characters and cinema have always made for intriguing bedfellows—although, unfortunately for us, movies with women warriors as protagonists have been rare. Luckily, in recent times, Bollywood has not shied away from restoring our unsung sheroes to their much-deserved primacy. Take Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat for example, which saw Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen known not just for her beauty but also her weaponry skills, or Karan Johar's attempt at fore-fronting lost legend and Aurangzeb's accomplished sister, Jahanara Begum (reportedly to be played by Kareena Kapoor Khan) in his upcoming epic period drama, Takht. 
Hindi cinema (and an audience that seems to prefer seeing men in leading roles) has finally warmed up to the idea of powerful female protagonists, and proof of this can be sought in the industry's upcoming releases. Tomorrow marks the release of Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, a feature excavating the story of one of India's most formidable female warriors, Rani Laxmibai, who changed our independence landscape with so much impact that we still feel the reverberations today. The film sees Kangana Ranaut as both the titular character and one of the directors, and also features known faces like Ankita Lokhande and Atul Kulkarni. Here, we teleport you to the 18th century to uncover some unknown facts about the Queen of Jhansi, before the rebellion and just before the release of the film on the silver screen. 
While her exact birth date may be contested, historians believe Rani Laxmibai was born on November 19, 1835, to a Marathi Brahmin family. Interestingly, the Queen of Jhansi was not in fact born in Jhansi; she took birth in Kashi (now Varanasi). 
Have you been wondering why Kangana Ranaut's movie is called Manikarnika if it's about Rani Laxmibai? Turns out, Manikarnika was the Queen's maiden name, and she was nicknamed Manu. She was rechristened to Lakshmibai in honour of Goddess Lakshmi on her wedding day in 1834—Rani Laxmibai married her husband, Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar of Jhansi (played by popular Bengali actor Jisshu Sengupta in the film), at just 14. 
Since her mother Bhagirathi Sapre's passing when she was four, Rani Lakshmibai was brought up in the household of the last Peshwa (ruler) of the Maratha Empire, Baji Rao II—Suresh Oberoi plays the role in Kangana Ranaut-starrer. Rani Lakshmibai's father, Moropant Tambe, worked at the Peshwa's court. She was homeschooled, unlike other girls her age, and taught how to wield a sword, along with other practices like shooting, horsemanship and fencing, with her childhood playmate and cousin, Tatya Tope (played by Atul Kulkarni in the period drama) and Nana Sahib, Baji Rao II's adopted son. She also took formal training in ancient gymnastic form of mallakhamba. 
Rani Laxmibai famously made the humble sari her uniform at home and on the battleground, and even a symbol of Swades. During wars, she apparently tied a scarf around her head to keep flyaways off her face, and draped the nine-yard staple in a typical Maharashtrian Nauvari style. In the movie Mankarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, Kangana Ranaut's grand outfits have been designed by Neeta Lulla. 
In 1851, the young Queen had given her husband an heir, but the baby did not survive for more than four months. Two years later, the raja followed his biological child to the grave. Following the then-established Hindu practise, just before his death, the Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin and future heir to the throne, who was later bestowed with the name Damodar Rao. Until he would come of age, the Queen would rule the state of Jhansi. 
After Maharaja's death, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, annexed the state to its territories by applying the Doctrine of Lapse policy, which dismissed Damodar's succession to the throne since he was adopted. The 22-year-old queen refused to cede Jhansi to the Raj, and wrote various well-formulated, legalistic letters to Lord Dalhousie to overturn this rule, but the officials ignored her appeals or reverted with vacuous explanations. In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was given an annual pension of Rs 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort. The astute ruler was, however, too brave to be cajoled. 
May 1857 marked the advent of the Indian Rebellion, which commenced in Meerut. When news of the struggle reached Jhansi, the Rani asked British political officer, captain Alexander Skene, for permission to raise a body of armed men for her own protection—and he agreed. Until January 1858, Jhansi was at peace under Rani Laxmibai's rule. When the British forces finally arrived in March they found it well-defended—she defended Jhansi when Sir Hugh Rose, Commander-in-chief for the British Raj in India, besieged the state. After putting up a tough fight, on April 2, the Rani withdrew from the palace on a horse, with Damodar Rao on her back and fled. The escort included Tatya Tope and warrior Gulam Gaus Khan (played by Danny Denzongpa in the film), who mounted a successful assault on the city fortress of Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. Just before her escape, Laxmibai told Jhalkaribai (played by Ankita Lokhande in Manikarnika) to set out for General Rose's camp in disguise and declare herself to be the Queen. This led to a confusion that continued for a whole day, which gave the Rani's army renewed advantage. 
There are two versions of how the Rani met her end. According to one version, a force led by Laxmibai fought the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, a cavalry regiment in the British army, near Phool Bagh of Gwalior, where over 5,000 Indian soldiers were killed. The Rani was wounded and unhorsed fighting back, and later shot by one of the Hussars. In another version, she, after being severely injured and not wanting the British to capture her body, asked a hermit to burn it. Both versions bear testimony to the brave fight she put up and her heroic death. 
In the British report of this battle in Jhansi, Sir Hugh Rose chronicled that Rani Lakshmibai is “personable, clever and beautiful”, and that she is “the most dangerous of all Indian leaders.” Rose commented that she had been buried “with great ceremony under a tamarind tree under the Rock of Gwalior, where I saw her bones and ashes.” 20 years after her demise, Colonel Malleson wrote in the History Of The Indian Mutiny, London, 1878: “Whatever her faults in British eyes may have been, her countrymen will ever remember that she was driven by ill-treatment into rebellion, and that she lived and died for her country.” 
The Queen served as a muse for generations of poets, writers, painters and filmmakers. In 1957, India issued two stamps to commemorate a centenary of her sacrifice—a stamp of 0.15 Naya Paisa showcasing her portrait on a horse in a battlefield, and another featuring a painting of Rani Lakshmibai by MF Hussain. 
Perched inside the Fort of Jhansi, Rani Jhansi Museum, as its name suggests, is dedicated to the Queen. The museum is home to some of the weapons used by Rani Lakshmibai and her fellow combatants throughout the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.

Alia Bhatt has proven herself as one of Bollywood’s strongest actors over the years. Ahead of her latest, Gully Boy, here’s a look back at her best work yet 
It's hard to believe that Alia Bhatt joined Bollywood just seven years ago. Only 19, Bhatt made her debut with a bang in Karan Johar's rom-com Student of the Year (2012), and there's been no looking back for her since. While SOTY had Bhatt playing high school Queen Bee Shanaya Singhania, the roles she's taken on after her big break have put her acting prowess in the spotlight. 
Two years after Student of the Year released, Bhatt surprised the country with her performance in Highway (2014), an intense, heart-breaking film in which she played a sheltered girl who finds her voice after getting kidnapped by a gang. But what really showcased her range was the fact that in the same year she transformed into Highway's Veera Tripathi, Alia Bhatt also had audiences falling in love with her strong-minded persona as Ananya Swaminathan in 2 States (2014) and her devil-may-care attitude as Kavya Singh in Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2014). 
As the years progressed, Alia Bhatt's movies have only gotten more exciting. If 2014 was the year she was all about romance, 2016 was the year she broke boundaries with a handful of unpredictable roles. For Udta Punjab (2016), Bhatt threw away her smartphone while getting into Bihari labourer Kumari Pinky's skin, and by the end of the year, she won critics over with her honest, open performance as Kaira in coming-of-age drama Dear Zindagi (2016). How does she do it? Bhatt once told us that she always wanted to act, “like a kid who desperately wants a lollipop.” And she's had years of practice. “As a child, my mind would always be somewhere else, imagining what I want to do, who I want to be. In car journeys, I would imagine myself in songs that played on the radio. I created my own worlds.” 
Most recently, Bhatt was seen putting her theatrical skills to the test as Indian spy Sehmat Syed in Raazi (2018), and it's safe to say that her fans can't wait to see what she's like as Sakina in 2018's musical drama, Gully Boy. If director Imtiaz Ali's word is anything to go by, Bhatt is likely to hit this one out of the park as well. "She is constantly trying to improve herself, to do more, to do better," he said back in 2014, and her films serve as proof. Scroll now for a peek at some of the best Alia Bhatt movies so far.

The Oscar nominations always bring with them a certain amount of drama. Read about all the omissions from the 2019 list that are currently making the headlines 
Back in 2013, when Ben Affleck lost out on the Best Director nomination at the Oscars for Argo, Bradley Cooper, then nominated for his role in Silver Linings Playbook, told Today that Affleck “got robbed.” His former sympathy now gets an injection of true empathy. 
The nominees for Oscar 2019 have been announced and it's time our disappointments will, once again, become what water-cooler conversations are made of. First things first, Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical black-and-white beauty, Roma, and Yorgos Lanthimos's The Favourite lead the nominations with 10 nods each, while Cooper's A Star Is Born got eight. 
Ironically, however, while A Star… is nominated for Best Picture, Cooper, in one of 2019's biggest Oscar snubs, failed to get nominated for Best Director. (He did get nominated for Best Actor, though, but with Rami Malek, Willem Dafoe and Viggo Mortensen as company, it's a formidable list.) 
In an interview on Entertainment Weekly, the producer of the movie, Lynette Howell Taylor, says, “I think that Bradley's passion and vision and tireless hard work is represented in the eight nominations the movie got. No one would be nominated without him. It's a wonderful year for movies. It's a tough category, but it's because of so many great movies. Of course, I would have loved him to have been recognised in that category but I really do believe that he's been truly recognised in every other way because he's the life and soul of this film.” 
Among directors with big-ticket films who failed to secure Best Director nods, Bradley Cooper has illustrious company—in the past there was Kathryn Bigelow (Zero Dark Thirty) and Quentin Tarantino (Django Unchained). Even once nominated, the road to Best Director at the Oscars has been paved with bad omissions—Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick never won for direction. 
Among other snubs this year, Emily Blunt, who starred in both A Quiet Place and Mary Poppins Returns, failed to get nominated for Best Actress and it's a miss that rankles. Yalitzia Aparicio's nomination for Roma, however, is heartening. A minor snub was Timothee Chalamet missing the Best Actor nomination for Beautiful Boy—and watchers have been quick to draw comparisons with a certain pretty boy being ignored for Titanic.

Indian American senator and now presidential candidate, Kamala Harris came to Washington to do the work and gave women across the US a voice inside the room where it happens 
If you want to ask Senator Kamala Harris whether she's planning to run for president, keep in mind her favourite Cardi B track: “Be careful.” The California Democrat will answer with polite exasperation because to discuss the race with her now, she believes, implies that political ambition motivates her work in the Senate. Instead it's a deep sense of justice that drives her. “I'm just trying to get at the truth,” says Harris, 54. “I don't believe my time is to sit here and spew poetry. It's not for some kind of performance art. It's not about grand gestures.” (Since the interview, Harris has gone on to announce her 2020 presidential candidacy.) 
Still, the narrative of her rise is the stuff great political careers are built on. Elected in November 2016, Harris is the lone African American woman in the Senate and its first ever Indian American. She was appointed by Democratic leadership to a seat on the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee and has pushed legislation centred around national security, civil rights and bail reform (an issue on which she has found common ground with Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky). 
Outside Washington she's gained fans and critics for her well-documented blunt talk. She's been on the front lines of every major issue in 2018, and the viral clips add up: Harris grilling Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen about the Trump administration's controversial child-separation policy; staring down Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his contacts with Russian nationals; pressing then Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh to name laws that govern the bodies of men (as abortion laws govern the bodies of women). After that exchange left Kavanaugh flustered, The Daily Show's Trevor Noah tallied the scorecard: “Goddamn, Kamala Harris brings it.” 
Harris credits her childhood as a daughter of immigrants for her confidence—even swagger. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a student from India, and her father, Donald Harris, an economics student from Jamaica, met as activists in the civil rights movement. As children, Kamala and her sister, Maya, followed them to marches. “It was the '60s and '70s, a charged time where everyone in my life was very actively involved,” Harris says. “One of the soundtracks of my childhood is ‘Young, gifted and black.' It was about being told you can do anything you want to do.” 
But Harris absorbed another message too: You're accountable. After her parents divorced when she was seven, her mother emphasised it. Harris remembers coming home and complaining about some mishap at school. “Other kids' parents would give them a big hug, ‘Oh, what happened, I'll handle that,'” she recalls. “My mother would look at me: ‘Well, what did you do?'” Harris learned to make her peace with it: “I was like, ‘You never took my side.' I realised she was teaching us that you've got to identify your position of power in a dynamic and not let things just happen to you.” 
At Howard University, Harris joined the debate team and became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country's first African American sorority. Jill B Louis, who pledged in spring 1986 with Harris, remembers a calm about her even then. “She was always a model of stability and composure,” Louis says. “Night or day, she was never rattled.” 
Harris went on to law school at University of California Hastings College of the Law and became a prosecutor, determined to enact criminal justice reform from within. “There is certainly a very important role to be played being on the outside,” she says. “But there is also a role to be played being on the inside at the table where the decisions are being made.” After, she served as district attorney of San Francisco and then was elected attorney general of California. There she worked in the trenches with now Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. “When you're the top law enforcement officer of the state, you are going to be surrounded mainly by men,” says Cortez Masto, who was attorney general of Nevada at the time. “Some, but not all men are going to be dismissive. You don't let that slow you down. The Kamala Harris that I know is not going to be forestalled by anybody trying to get in the way of her doing her job.” 
Sitting on a couch in her Senate office, across from a bust of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court justice, Harris connects her time as a prosecutor to her responsibilities now. It's the week of the public hearings on Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, amidst allegations of his sexual misconduct while in high school. She knew the nation was overdue for a public conversation about sexual assault, she says. (Despite the nationwide protests, Kavanaugh went on to secure the Supreme Court nomination.) When she'd overseen jury selection for such cases as an attorney, men and women would often ask to be excused. Behind closed doors, they'd say, stricken, “I don't want to share this in the open courtroom because I've never told anybody, but I cannot sit on this jury because that happened to me.” Not long ago, after a black-tie event, an acquaintance's wife sent her a note. “When she was 14, she was raped by an 18-year-old student,” Harris says. The woman had kept it a secret for years, but now she implored: “Please fight for women everywhere whose stories may not have been told.” 
Such stories are her motivation now, despite attacks from all sides. Both conservatives and even some progressives have taken up the hashtag #neverkamala to voice their concern that she's either too liberal or not progressive enough. The White House Twitter account took aim at her in July, tweeting “@SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS- 13? You must not know what ICE really does,” after Harris called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be rebuilt “starting from scratch.” (Harris tweeted back: “As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organisations. That's being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.”) 
In the meantime Harris has raised over US$5 million to help elect Democrats in the midterms, proof she's a bankable leader. Her second book, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, is set for release this month, well-timed for the unofficial kickoff for the 2020 race. About President Trump, she pulls no punches: He “has decided to, I think, spew hate and division,” she says. She'd like to take a different path. “One of the things that all leaders need to do is speak truth, even if it's an uncomfortable truth. I think it is really important that we are fighting for the best of who we are as a country, and I do believe we are better than this.”

The latest siblings to be in conversation with Karan Johar, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan give fans a hilarious peek into the workings of the Bachchan household 
It should come as little surprise that Koffee with Karan's famous couch has played host to some of the most iconic celebrity sibling duos this season, given Karan Johar's soft spot for family. Keeping up the camaraderie, this week's offering saw Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan stepping up to the mantle in their first time on the show together, and it was everything you could have expected from the witty siblings. While Abhishek opted for a statement jacket, Shweta opted for a monochrome palette with head-turning leather pants that you'll have a hard time tearing your eyes away from. Career sabbaticals to star-kid stereotypes, no topic was off the table as the duo settled in for a cosy chat. In case you missed it, here are the important highlights from the Koffee with Karan episode that you need to know about. 
After Housefull 3, the actor admitted that he needed some time away from the big screen, heralding in a gap of three years in his filmography before eventually returning with Manmarziyan. “I was a part of huge films, huge budgets, huge stars, huge collections, everything was hunky-dory; I had no pressure as I was standing beside or behind somebody else who was shouldering all the pressure, and as I was making lots of money, it became very easy. With all respect to my all co-stars, I didn't come to the industry to the stand behind anyone,” he divulged. 
2018 saw Janhvi Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan making triumphant inroads into Bollywood, but Navya Naveli won't be joining their ranks anytime soon. Her mother clarified, “I'm on Instagram and I follow my brother, and I know the hate he gets. Whether you like him as an actor or not, it will bother me as a sister. I hated it… It gave me sleepless nights and I don't want yet another member of my family to be in this business for selfish reasons. Firstly, I don't know what Navya's talent is. Just because she is related to some famous people, doesn't mean she has what it takes.” 
The rapid fire round had Abhishek sportingly revealing that Aamir Khan played the starring role in Shweta's first teenage crush. Once the Dangal actor was made aware of it, he kindly took the time out to send her personalised letters on her birthday. 
Not even the most powerful family in Bollywood is immune to forwards on WhatsApp family groups. Abhishek revealed, “My mom has this habit of sending the most sentimental forwards every day just to wish good morning that no one ever reads.” “Well, no one except papa [Amitabh Bachchan] who replies to them a whole two days later,” Shweta chimed in. 
There is a clear case of momma's boy in the Bachchan household; “Her eyes light up when he walks into the room,” revealed Shweta, while Abhishek retorted that she is Amitabh Bachchan's favourite. “Even if God comes down, if Shwet di is there, it's all over. Nothing else matters to him,” he shared.

While misogynistic and distasteful, cricketer Hardik Pandya’s remarks on Koffee with Karan are symptomatic of a more pervasive concern—the lack of sensitisation to women’s issues 
There's no doubt that cricketer Hardik Pandya's comments on popular TV show Koffee With Karan were sexist and crass, and the consequent backlash, more than justified. What was even more disturbing, however, were comments made by his father to a tabloid in his defence: “I don't think people should read too much into his comments. It was an entertainment show and his comments were made in a light-hearted manner. He was only looking to entertain the audience. So, it [his comments] should not be viewed very seriously or negatively. He is an innocent boy with a very fun-loving nature.” This, in my opinion, is where the problem lies. 
As a mother of a teenage boy, it's disconcerting that these are the kind of role models being homegrown—homegrown being the operative word. The BCCI has of course punished both Pandya and KL Rahul (who appeared with him on Koffee With Karan) by recalling them from the ongoing cricket series in Australia, banning them from further matches indefinitely, thereby effectively putting an end to their careers (the players have also lost out on major endorsement deals). But will this really solve the problem of sexist issues and gender inequality in our country? 
In the months to come, this controversial episode will soon be forgotten, till another one rears its ugly head. And while this has been said before (and just as easily been forgotten), teaching men to be more respectful towards women begins at home and begins young. I grew up with a younger brother, thankfully in an extremely progressive household where both of us were treated equally by our parents in all respects. Such statements about women in a “light-hearted manner” for an “entertainment show” as Hardik Pandya's father puts it, would not be tolerated under any circumstances. 
In the midst of the very important #MeToo movement where several women are finally boldly speaking out against the injustices they've had to face over the years, it's sad misogynists are still given a platform to air their distasteful and damaging views. Given the impact such statements from celebrities could have on young minds, don't we owe our children better? 
As much as I'd like to hope, I know things won't change, not in the near future at least. Not till our influencers, and more importantly, we as a society, get more proactive and instead of paying lip service to movements, start affecting real changes—like taking ownership of the messages we put out in the world.

From Priyanka Chopra Jonas's first guests to what inspired her to create the series, here’s everything you need to know to know about the Youtube Originals show If I Could Tell You Just One Thing 
In the last couple of years, Priyanka Chopra Jonas has stood out as a multi-hyphenate par excellence. Above being a  a superstar, Chopra Jonas has proved that the title she most identifies with is that of an achiever. A couple of weeks into 2019, she has announced the launch of a new YouTube Originals show If I Could Tell You Just One Thing that she will be hosting herself. 
While the internet got busy posting then and now pictures in lieu of the #10YearChallenge, Priyanka Chopra Jonas used the opportune moment to talk about what actually contributed to her transformation in the last decade, and how she plans to help her fans grow from her learnings. “In these 10 years, with everything I've done, I realised that it's my curiosity in others that has led me to grow into who I am today. So I decided to feed my curiosity by starting a journey where I will meet some extraordinary people,” she said recently. 
Who doesn't want to spend time chatting with Priyanka Chopra Jonas? The premise behind the YouTube Originals show was to introduce the star's audience to an achiever with every episode. As the name suggests, the conversations will revolve around the one thing the guest did to be immensely successful in their field. Chopra Jonas, who has been shuttling between New York, Los Angeles and Mumbai for the last few years has picked none other than Olympian Simone Biles, an American favourite, to be the first guest of her show. “She packs a punch, what I admire most about her is her resilience and her ability to bounce back from anything,” she said fondly of Biles. 
Inching towards style, Diane von Furstenberg is going to be the second guest to be featured on the show. “I think fashion is such as interesting part of our lives, and she has been such a big part of fashion, so I am excited to sit down with her and listen to her legendary stories,” Chopra Jonas revealed to her 35 million followers on Instagram. What's notable about our cover star's game plan towards world domination is that Chopra Jonas isn't tied down by mediums to explore more opportunities for growth. After mainstream cinema, the actor delved into production, invested in an app and now has taken on digital video with this YouTube Originals show. Inspired yet?

Deepika Padukone has never been the kind of star to gives it all away on social media but as of the las year or so, the actor has opened up to her followers and well-wishers more than ever before via her Twitter and Instagram pages.

The third sibling set to make their way to the Koffee with Karan couch, Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter’s candid chat had them talking about family, work and exes 
When you have Karan Johar running the ship, it is indeed all about loving your family. It should come as little surprise then, that familial bonhomie has emerged as the triumphant theme of the ongoing season of Koffee With Karan, with many celebrity siblings gracing the couch. Debutante Janhvi and Arjun Kapoor were succeeded by the merry trio of Sonam, Rhea and Harshvardhan Kapoor, and the latest outing of the candid chat show had Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter taking the mic. Dressed in a coordinated monochrome palette, the freewheeling chat had the brothers dropping their guard for a rare peek into their lives. From navigating celebrity exes to the million dollar are-they-aren't-they question about Janhvi and Khatter's dating life, here are the top five moments from the episode that'll monopolise the conversation at your next coffee break: 
The calendar year may have changed, but the marathon of celebrity weddings in 2018 is still very much on everyone's minds. Having tied the knot with Mira Kapoor in 2015, Shahid had plenty of marriage tips to dole out. His top advice for Nick Jonas? "Never back down, buddy. You're with the original desi girl." He went on to admit that he had bumped into Kareena Kapoor Khan at an event in the past, and she had wished him well for his marriage. 
The father of two went on to admit that he had become something of a social recluse post marriage. “My relationship status with most of the industry is zilch. Ever since I got married, I have literally not had a social life. I don't know if that's a good thing, I probably think it's a really bad thing. I was a recluse anyway, and now I am so into my kids that every time I finish shooting, I am only with them,” he admitted. 
The eve of Khatter's big ticket foray into mainstream Bollywood cinema was peppered with presumptions from diehard fans of Sairaat, which served as the premise for its Hindi remake, Dhadak. This worked out to be a blessing, and otherwise as well. The young 23-year-old divulged the polar reactions he received for his performance in Dhadak; “A lot of people who had seen Sairaat felt it was a gimmicky remake of the film. But there were also people who had had initially felt that it wouldn't live up to the original film, but were pleasantly surprised.” 
Throw together two good looking debutants, and speculation is bound to fly. Finally clearing the air, the Dhadak star announced, "No we're not dating. We hang out, go to the gym, eat food, watch movies and listen to South Indian music together." Addressing Arjun Kapoor's queries about how Khatter is always buzzing around her, Shahid chimed in, “Ishaan generally buzzes around people a lot. He is a buzzy guy. Janhvi is not special.” 
While their equation may not be conventional, but their strong love for each other has pulled them together. “[My mother] literally had Ishaan for me. I have paternal feelings towards him; feelings like an elder brother but also, at times, like a dad," Shahid revealed before adding, “There are so many different types of relationships that exist today and I don't think there are any rules to the game. It's all about love, togetherness, forgiving, learning to move on and learning to prioritise the fact that you eventually want to be together.”

Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's Australian getaway looks like an absolute blast. Here's a peek at the couple's sweetest pictures from the vacation 
Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have been on the go since December 2018, and their social media pages have been a great way for fans to keep up with their adorable travel pictures. Currently, the duo have been spending a few weeks in Australia, where Kohli and the Indian cricket team were playing ODI (One Day International) matches and even recently won a historic test series against Australia. In case you missed it, Sharma had celebrated her husband's big moment with the sweetest Instagram post. 
With all the cricket matches done and dusted, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have decided to stay back in Australia for a while to spend some quality time together and this weekend, the two shared some pictures of themselves getting close to nature during their vacation. Sharma and Kohli's latest posts show them hanging out with beautiful horses in the sunset, on what looks like a large ranch. Dressed in a simple black T-shirt, matching ebony jeans and (no surprises here) white sneakers, Sharma looked perfect for a day outdoors, and proved once again that she's happiest when she's dressed in comfortable casuals. Complementing her look for the day, Kohli kept his look fuss-free in a black tee and beige shorts too. One of the couple's sweetest pictures from the day has to be the one of them smiling for the camera while hugging each other. 
Wondering where exactly you may spot Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli if you're holidaying in Australia right now as well? Sharma recently put up an Instagram picture of herself on a flight, which she captioned “Happy face 😀 ✈️ #workmode #canberra”. The capital city of Australia, Canberra is known for its great sports facilities, and Canberra Nature Parks are a must-visit in the area, offering mountain bike trails and horse trails too. If you and your SO love spending time outdoors, you may want to follow in Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's footsteps for your next getaway.

Can you guess what it is? 
As fans wait with barely-contained excitement for the new and final season of Game of Thrones, HBO has dropped new information on the prequel of the series, and hawk-eyed Potterheads have spotted this detail that—if you're a fan of the series—you wouldn't want to miss. 
Last evening, HBO released the cast of the Game of Thrones prequel that's currently in the works, with details on the show and its timeline in comparison to the current show. But what has Harry Potter fans excited is the fact that both actors who played young Dumbledore (Toby Regbo) and Grindelwald (Jamie Campbell Bower) in the Fantastic Beasts series are part of the new show. 
Apart from Bower and Regbo, the cast for the GoT spinoff features Naomi Ackie (Lady Macbeth), Denise Gough (Monday), Sheila Atim (Harlots), Ivanno Jeremiah (Humans), Georgie Henley (The Chronicles of Narnia films) and Alex Sharp (How to Talk to Girls at Parties). 
If you were curious about what's in store, this is what Hbo.com has to say about the show: "Taking place thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones, the series chronicles the world's descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. From the horrifying secrets of Westeros's history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend, only one thing is for sure: It's not the story we think we know." 
Take a look at the cast now.

How can you not fall for Ranveer Singh after watching this? 
I can't speak for everyone but the one Bollywood movie that's on my must-watch list in 2019 is Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy. Based on the lives of rappers Divine (Vivian Fernandes) and Nazey (Naved Shaikh) the Tiger Baby and Excel Entertainment production promises to be raw, exciting and something you haven't seen before. The story focuses on the emergence of the underground hip hop scene in Mumbai. Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Kalki Koechlin and Navin Singh make the perfect eclectic cast for the never-before-explored narrative. 
Ranveer Singh has been teasing the launch of the trailer all week and finally, after dropping the first look of the movie, the official trailer for the film is out. Gauging from the clip, Ranveer Singh is the son of a driver living in the slums of Mumbai, who loses a rap battle with his neighbourhood's local boys. Though his character is passionate about writing rap, he doesn't buy into the genre that only shows off about clothes, cars and women. Gully Boy seems to tell the story of an aspiring artist who beats adversity, poverty and societal norms to make a name for himself. Alia Bhatt plays the part of a young medical student who seems meek, but watch the trailer and you'll realise she's anything but that. Kalki Koechlin also stars as a love interest, but it's clear that Bhatt has Singh's attention with her fiery persona. 
Needless to say, the OST for the movie is one you'll soon be listening to on repeat. Rapper Divine spent 2018 working with the Gully Boy team has created five tracks for the OST.  The track ‘Azaadi' is a commentary on corruption in the government and the apathetic attitude towards public struggle. ‘Apna time ayega' is an anthem for those enduring in the face of strife. “From doing cyphers on the corners to watching the scene on the big screen, dreams! Hip-hop is the voice of the streets and Gully Boy will take it to every corner of the country,” said the artist. 
Ranveer Singh, the angry, young rapper is more endearing than any other role you may have seen the actor play before. Alia Bhatt, who has only offered stellar hits in 2018, is sure to deliver in this one too. Date or not this Valentine's Day, this film, which hits theatres on February 14, is one you cannot miss. Don't believe us? Watch the trailer to decide for yourself.

Vogue India's January 2019 cover girl Priyanka Chopra Jonas has no complaints from her seemingly perfect life.

So what's next for the star? “[To become] bigger and better,” says Chopra Jonas. “This beautiful contentment that I have in my life, with everything around me, is perfect.” Asked about the secret that keeps their multi-continent romance going, despite their busy schedules and long distances, the star answers with a big laugh, before revealing their trick.

Details out now 
It's been close to a year since the untimely demise of Bollywood icon Sridevi, which shook not just the film industry, but hundreds of followers and well-wishers across the world in 2018. Since then, the actor hasn't just earned a National Award posthumously (received by her family in Delhi last May), but also made her last silver screen appearance in Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif's latest release, Zero. Now, fans of the late Sridevi may get to celebrate her once again, if the latest news doing the rounds is to be believed. 
Reports state that Boney Kapoor is planning to copyright the life story of Sridevi, giving him the ability to create a biopic on his wife if and when he chooses to. "He's definitely planning to tell Sridevi's story in a movie before anyone else does," a source revealed to a news portal recently. "Believe me, there are several filmmakers planning to make films on her. Before they get down to it, Boney wants to copyright her life story so that only he will be able to make his wife's biopic the way he wants to." What's more, Sridevi fans may also be able to get their hands on books based on her life in the coming year. "Several journalists and authors have approached Boney and he may very soon select someone to write on Sridevi. There are many plans to further the Sri legend in 2019." Rumour has it that if Boney Kapoor does go ahead with a biopic on Sridevi, he will both, produce and direct it himself. 
Having started her career in cinema at the age of four, Sridevi was an inspiration to many and earned herself the title of Indian cinema's very first female superstar. While we wait for a confirmation on her upcoming biopic, it's hard not to wonder which actor will be selected to step into her shoes, and it's safe to assume that many would expect to see the actor's older daughter, Janhvi Kapoor play the role. "I ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace," the 21-year-old wrote post the death of her mother in February 2018. "Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his “Jaan”. She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife. She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles. It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love. For people to be good and gracious and kind. She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy. So let's be that. Let's be full of only good and give only love. That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something. The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form. That's what she stood for. Dignity, strength and innocence."

Couture goodness 
Kicking off awards season for 2019, the 76th Golden Globes took place at The Beverly Hilton in California last evening. The red carpet looked more colourful than last year's, when the wake of #MeToo, black had been omnipresent, as were badges and pins in solidarity of victims. In black or not, this year too, the stars stepped out in their glamorous best to celebrate their achievements and recognise the best in the business. Here's a quick recap of some of our favourite sartorial showcases on the red carpet. 
Monday blues looked slightly different this morning as we woke up to an Instagram feed gasping at Lady Gaga's icy glory. The A Star Is Born actor paid an ode to the late Judy Garland, who played the lead in the original rendition of the film, with her custom Valentino couture creation. The lavender hued full-skirted gown was inspired by the dress Garland in the movie making it an extra special moment on the red carpet. Naturally, her was dyed in a similar tint to match the hue of her gown. Joining her in pale blue were Dakota Fanning and Alison Brie. 
Charlize Theron and Rachel Weisz came out strong in elegant black and white dresses, while Saoirse Ronan, who always manages to make a statement with her wardrobe choices, wore a daring silver beaded gown by Gucci that complemented her pale hair. Lupita Nyong'o's embellished royal blue column gown by Calvin Klein, on the other hand, was styled with a pair of heels from Aldo—who said all thing beautiful only come at a high price? 
From Emily Blunt's intricately detailed Alexander McQueen dress to Rachel Brosnahan and Claire Foy's bright yellow looks, here are the dresses we most loved from the 76th Golden Globes.

This one’s already taken over the internet 
Just days after releasing its posters, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt and Kalki Koechlin shared the trailer announcement of their upcoming film Gully Boy today via their Instagram accounts, and it's everything you thought it would be. Titled Asli Hip Hop, the sneak peek has already taken over the internet, and promises to be an exciting watch this 2019. 
Loosely based on the lives of Indian street rappers Divine and Naezy, Gully Boy tells a gripping tale of success and the struggles that come with it. The teaser depicts the journey of a boy from the slums of Mumbai, who goes on to become one of the biggest names in the Indian rap scene. The soundtrack of the video is, of course, a rap performed by Ranveer Singh himself, where he seamlessly delivers one line after another about introducing India to ‘asli hip-hop'. Like all great stories, this one also sees Singh facing roadblocks in his path, posed by family and friends in his case. Both Kalki Koechlin and Alia Bhatt play love interests in the film, but little can be discerned about their roles through the teaser. 
Within hours of the trailer announcement being shared on Singh's social media pages, wife Deepika Padukone posted her thoughts on her husband's performance. “You are unstoppable,” she wrote with a fire emoji, and then continued by commenting, “I love you and I'm so proud of you!” With a first look like that, it's no surprise that the rest of Bollywood has also voiced their excitement for the film. Scroll ahead to find out what Karan Johar and Arjun Kapoor had to say about it. 
Gully Boy will release on February 14, 2019, after its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. Check out the trailer announcement below.

From over 900 registrations, eight designers have been shortlisted for the award 
Of late, sustainability in fashion has been gaining more weightage rather than just being a mere buzzword. We've seen leading luxury labels ban fur and exotic animal skins from their collections in an attempt to address animal rights. And now, Reliance Industries Ltd's R.Elan, Lakmé Fashion Week and the United Nations have joined hands to birth India's first sustainability award in fashion—the Circular Design Challenge. With over 900 registrations from more than 30 cities, eight designers have been selected, one of which will take home the cash prize of Rs 20 lakh. 
One detrimental impact of the fashion industry on the environment is the sheer amount of waste created by fashion houses and consumers alike. According to analytics from the UN Comtrade, India is the top importer of used clothes—clothes that would have otherwise ended up in landfill—that are broken down into yarn and then rewoven into fabric used to make blankets. Following a similar idea, the Circular Design Challenge tested the shortlisted designers on circular fashion—a concept that aims to reduce landfill waste and increase the longevity of clothes. “Our partnership with the UN in India and R. Elan's Fashion for Earth initiative for the Circular Design Challenge is a step towards identifying and supporting champions in the field of sustainability," explains Jaspreet Chandok, vice president and head of fashion at IMG Reliance. 
The eight shortlisted designers—Aiman Sabri of Pozruh, Aman Singh of Bareek, Bhavya Goenka of IRO IRO, Poornima Pande and Stefano Funari of I Was A Sari, Kanika Ahuja of Lifaffa, Pooja Monga of Salpetre, Seerat Virdi of Miesu and Kriti Tula of Doodlage—all incorporated waste fabrics in their collections while also looking at the aesthetic quotient, business viability and value chain aspects. 
“Total greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production, at 1.2 billion tonnes annually, are more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. Creative approaches such as the Circular Design Challenge are a perfect opportunity to promote sustainable textile production and consumption, and accelerate sustainable development in general," says Atul Bagai, UN Environment, country head, India. 
“As a designer, I want to use the power of fashion to make eco cool,” says Aiman Sabri, who used discarded fabric from T-shirts and other cutting waste as well as techniques like eco-friendly dyeing in her collection. Poornima Pande and Stefano Funari of I Was A Sari upcycled used saris and added hand embroidery to create new products. On the other hand, Aman Singh of Bareek utilised waste plastic collected from beaches in Goa which were processed as PET fabric for his collection of shirts, an idea explored by Kanika Ahuja of Lifaffa as well as Salpetre's Pooja Monga, both of whom used fabric made from recycled plastic in their collections. 
“As designers, we have power to influence change, and realising that made me shift my practices to be more ethical,” says Seerat Virdi of Miesu, who incorporated fabrics like discarded cotton and organic silks in her collection, similar to Kriti Tula's Doodlage, who included discarded lyocell fabric, recycled cotton and wool in her collection. “In 2018, we saved more than 6,000 metres of fabric from ending up in landfills, saved 4.6 million litres of water and reduced our carbon footprint by 18,000kgs,” says Tula. Meanwhile, Bhavya Goenka's Iro Iro collection focussed on utilising an indigenous fibre, Aakh, grown without water in Rajasthan. 
Every single designer showcased innovative sustainable techniques, but only one will bag the prestigious award and win a cash prize of Rs 20 lakh to build their brand. The winner will be announced on January 31, 2019 during Lakmé Fashion Week's spring/summer edition. 
Take a look at the shortlisted collections below:

Awards season is right around the corner. Before it begins, here’s a sneak peek of what to expect 
2018 marked a landmark year not just for Hollywood, which came together post the unmasking of common sexual predators in the industry, but also for awards shows, the stage where many chose to display their stand. At the Golden Globe Awards 2018, which was celebrating its 75th anniversary, Oprah Winfrey delivered a rousing acceptance speech as she stepped up to the stage to receive the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award, sparking off a fresh round of speculation about possible US presidential candidacy in 2020. Natalie Portman called out the all-male nominees for Best Director, while Elisabeth Moss borrowed from Margaret Atwood's famous words to say, “We no longer live in the blank white spaces at the edge of print. We no longer live in the gaps between the stories. We are the story in print, and we are writing the story ourselves.” 
Following up on the teary-eyed moments and the jubilant triumphs, Vogue delivers an all-purpose guide to the Golden Globes, one of most talked-about events on the award season calendar. 
What started out as an informal luncheon in the mid-1940s has since evolved into one of the most entertaining events on the social calendar, claiming valuable real estate on the trophy shelves of some of the most talented names in showbiz. If you've noticed the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gaining recurring mentions in acceptance speeches, it is because the organisation originally started the awards ceremony in 1944 to honour cinematic achievements in 26 categories, comprising of 15 from film and 11 from television respectively. Now in its 76th year, a handpicked roster of feature-length films and broadcast programmes are screened before a panel of around 90 foreign journalists who form the voting body. 
The 75th Annual Golden Globes held in 2018 served as a landmark event, as some of the most distinguished names in the cinematic sphere joined hands to actively call out the rampant sexism and skewed notions of gender equality in Hollywood. The discourse was nuanced with a plethora of turning-point achievements, as Sterling K Brown became the first black actor to win Best Actor in a Television Series for his role in This Is Us. The feminist undercurrents further manifested in the beauty choices of its glamorous attendees, as Best Actress Frances McDormand picked up her statuette without a glimmer of makeup on her face, while elsewhere on the red carpet, Jessica Biel boldly let her gray roots show through in her elegant updo. 
It's been a year since, and the #MeToo movement has grown up leaps and bounds, and so has the conversation around women's rights and equal representation. Heading into 2019, we can expect to see further reflections of the industry's unified stance against malpractices on the red carpet, whether through subtle moves such as the all-black dress code or through overt gestures and empowering acceptance speeches. 
After Seth Meyers inched the bar higher with his fiery monologue that took on the Harvey Weinstein-sized elephant in the room in the 2018 Golden Globes, and following in his footsteps will be Sandra Oh—best remembered for her portrayal of Dr Cristina Yang in Grey's Anatomy— and Andy Samberg, of Brooklyn Nine Nine fame. The duo hold individual Golden Globes of their own, and will be taking to the stage again after presenting the 2018 Primetime Emmy Awards together. “Sandra and Andy are the perfect choices to host this world-class event,” said NBC Entertainment co-chairmen Paul Telegdy and George Cheeks in a joint statement. “They bring wit, charm and style to a room filled with the very best of film and television. It's sure to be another unforgettable, fun-filled night.” 
The most noted names of the film and television fraternity will be heading to the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California for the big night. The snazzy red carpet event has come a long way since the humble luncheon when it was first launched in 1944. Subsequent years saw the informal tonality being subtly honed into the star-studded gala that it is today, through formal banquets at the Beverly Hills Hotel. This year, the Golden Globe awards will be held on Sunday, January 6, 2019. While the ceremony will be telecast from 5-8pm Pacific Time, viewers in India will have to set their alarm clock for an early morning wake-up call if they'd like to catch the proceedings live, at 6.30am. 
Last year saw the swish set dressed in all-black to signal their allegiance to the Time's Up movement, with Meryl Streep and Angelina Jolie following suit to showcase their solidarity with victims of abuse and assault. While the official memo reads black tie only, we can expect to see continued support for the concerns shrouding the film fraternity at the moment, all served in the go-to uniform of voluminous princess gowns and fluffy tulle concoctions. Dior and Oscar De La Renta continue to remain crowd-favourites, with Lorraine Schwartz is the name that the glam squad turns to for their jewellery. 
As the premier awards ceremony for the year, the Golden Globes sets the tone for the season. The nominee selections serve up crucial insight into which names will be favoured and become major contenders for the Academy Awards a few months later. The nominee considerations prove to be indicative of future wins as well, with Leonardo DiCaprio bagging a Golden Globe in 2016, and ultimately bringing home the Oscar for Best Actor later that year for his performance in The Revenant. 
The relevance of the awards function is thrown into further light when considering the role it played in uniting the industry in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein accusations. 2018 saw an overwhelming majority of the attendees sporting all-black ensembles and Time's Up pins to signify their commitment to the cause. The 2019 ceremony will serve interesting insight into the actual progress made since, and where the fraternity stands on the issue one year on. 
The nominees for this year's ceremony have been officially announced, and leading the pack is Vice, the irreverent comedy starring Christian Bale, that has picked up six nominations. Following closely behind are A Star Is Born, The Favourite and Green Book with five nominations apiece. When it comes to the television side of the chalkboard, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story picked up four nominations, while The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and Sharp Objects pulled in three approvals each. The nominations will be subjected to further scrutiny by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which includes 90 independent members, before the votes are tallied by the accountancy firm, Ernst & Young. 
The attendees include the nominees, their guests and recognised members of the press. The Beverly Hilton ballroom will be playing host to roughly 1,280 people, with another 3,000 guests attending viewing parties elsewhere in the hotel. The live telecast managed to pull in a whopping amount of 19 million viewers in 2018, and the numbers are only expected to further rise. The show is by invitation only, which are usually limited to the nominees starring the movies and TV shows selected for consideration. However, an extremely selective amount of VIP concierge packages are available at The Beverly Hilton from upwards of $2,599 for the weekend.

From at-home parties to envy-worthy getaways 
After a slew of winter weddings and countless Christmas parties, 2018 finally came to a close this weekend, and Bollywood's favourite faces bid the year that was farewell in the grandest of manners. While some welcomed 2019 with buzzing parties, others chose to spend the occasion away from the country with their nearest and dearest. No matter where they were, however, the stars made sure to share their New Year's Eve experiences with the world via their social media feeds. If you missed out on Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Sonam K Ahuja, Alia Bhatt and Kareena Kapoor Khan's last few moments of 2018, here's a quick recap. 
For Sonam K Ahuja, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Neha Dhupia, December 31, 2018 was their first New Year's eve as newly-weds, and all three stars chose to spend the special evening with their husbands. Holidaying in a tropical spot, Kapoor Ahuja shared a picture of herself with Anand Ahuja on January 1 counting all her blessings from the year, and somewhere in Switzerland, Priyanka Chopra Jonas brought 2019 in with a kiss from Nick Jonas. Dhupia, who also became a mother this year, posted an interesting snapshot of herself with Angad Bedi, saying "This definitely was and always will be the most special year of my life... you made me a wife and a mother." Another adorable couple picture that's been doing the rounds is that of Anushka Sharma and husband Virat Kohli, who celebrated their second new year as a married couple this weekend. Did you miss their picture perfect post from Australia? 
For many Bollywood stars this year, New Year's eve brought the chance to spend some quality time with family. While Alia Bhatt joined beau Ranbir Kapoor for a fun-filled New Year's dinner with Neetu and Rishi Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan spent the last few days of 2018 enjoying some time in the snow with husband Saif Ali Khan and son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. To escape the December chill, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan and Aaradhya Bachchan spent their New Year's eve at the beach, while Mira Rajput Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor seemed to have brought the year to an end with some quiet time with their kids at home. 
While most chose to kickstart 2019 outside of India, some Bollywood stars stayed close to home this festive season. Among the many parties that lit up Mumbai on December 31, Sonali Bendre's New Year's Eve-cum-birthday celebration was one to remember, and was attended by everyone from Sussanne Khan and Hrithik Roshan to Kunal Kapoor and wife Naina Bachchan. Not too far away, Sanjay Kapoor and Maheep Kapoor chose to usher 2019 in with a house party of their own, and one of the sweetest pictures to emerge from the get-together was that of Malaika Arora, Arjun Kapoor and Karan Johar standing alongside the hosts, captioned "Family".

Did you manage to figure out the message? 
When it comes to movie choices, Sonam K Ahuja's have only gotten better over time. While 2016 saw her transform into Neerja Bhanot, a PanAm flight attendant who died saving the lives of passengers during a hijack, 2018's light-hearted Veere Di Wedding had her inspiring women all over the country to live their lives on their own terms. And by the looks of it, 2019 is going to include another must-watch movie from the star, with Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga's release. 
Released just minutes ago, the trailer of Sonam K Ahuja's next film isn't just exciting for its cast. Full of cute dialogues, vibrant Indian wedding scenes and some very promising musical tracks (did you notice the new-age version of Anil Kapoor's iconic 1994 song with the same name?), the feel-good trailer also includes an important message. While the first watch may have you thinking Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga is one more rom-com about a Punjabi girl's wedding, a replay of the two-and-a-half minute trailer will tell you an entirely different story. In case you missed it, ELKDTAL's trailer was released on YouTube with the hashtag #LetLoveBe, and a few key scenes in the sneak peek also hint that the movie could possibly deal with same-sex relationships, with Sonam playing a lesbian character. 
Given that India is currently celebrating the decriminalisation of homosexuality and topics relating to sexual inclusivity are finally at the forefront in our country, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga (notice the relevance of the name now?) couldn't have come at a better time. Bonus: the movie will also, for the very first time, show Sonam K Ahuja sharing screen space with her father Anil Kapoor, and will hopefully share a glimpse at what the father-daughter duo's bond is really like. Kapoor Ahuja shared the first poster of the movie on Anil Kapoor's 62nd birthday, which took place on December 24. Did you miss her caption? 
If you still haven't watched the trailer of Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, now's your chance to catch up. The movie, which also stars Rajkummar Rao and Juhi Chawla, releases on February 1, 2019!

Featuring Taimur Ali Khan, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and many more 
As streets all over the world lit up with fairy lights for Christmas this year, so did the homes of many Bollywood personalities, who hosted more than just a few unmissable celebrations over the weekend. From hearty family feasts to late night dance-offs, here's a look at how some of your favourite celebrities (from Deepika Padukone and Kareena Kapoor Khan to Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Alia Bhatt) spent their Christmas this year. 
While Bollywood's biggest stars celebrated Christmas with a bang in India, Priyanka Chopra Jonas joined her husband Nick Jonas' family yesterday for her very first Christmas as a newly-wed. Joined by mother Madhu Chopra, Chopra Jonas spent quality time with her new family in England over several Christmas meals together. One of the sweetest pictures from the actor's celebrations shows her raising a toast for the camera, surrounded by her loved ones at a huge dinner table that came complete with candles and desserts. It's safe to say none can compare to her festive meal. 
One celebrity family that takes Christmas very seriously is the Kapoor crew. Each year, the Kapoors come together for a Christmas brunch at late actor Shashi Kapoor's residence, and 2018 was no exception. While Kareena Kapoor Khan kept her look classic for the occasion in a white shirt and black jeans, sister Karisma Kapoor picked a pretty printed dress for her day out, but all eyes were (no surprise here) on Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, who coordinated his Christmas brunch look with his father Saif Ali Khan in blue. Prior to the Christmas brunch (which was also attended by Ranbir Kapoor), Kareena Kapoor Khan hosted a little party of her own at home. Did you miss this snapshot of Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan hanging out with little Taimur at the party? 
While the Kapoors and Jonases celebrated Christmas with lots of food and photos, Salman Khan took his Christmas to the next level with an outdoor celebration that featured lots of dancing. While Karan Johar attended the get-together with kids Yash and Roohi Johar, Dia Mirza joined husband Sahil Sangha for the evening, and Katrina Kaif made sure to drop by too. Towards the end of the night, Khan and his brothers took over the dance floor, and their latest video is one you just can't miss out on. 
Christmas 2018 was clearly a memorable one for everyone in the industry. Who else did we spot having a blast on the special occasion? Scroll through our gallery to check out Alia Bhatt dressed in her Christmas best, Deepika Padukone partying with husband Ranveer Singh, Jacqueline Fernandez's picture-perfect moment with her pet cats and AbRam Khan's super sweet Christmas picture with dad Shah Rukh Khan.

Take a look inside 
It's the season to celebrate with one's nearest and dearest, and Bollywood did just that over the weekend. On the evening of December 22, producer Ritesh Sidhwani and wife Dolly Sidhwani hosted an at-home Christmas party that was attended by some of their favourite people in the industry, including Twinkle Khanna, Sidharth Malhotra, Neha Dhupia and husband Angad Bedi, Anil Kapoor, Mouni Roy and Shweta Bachchan Nanda. Who joined them at the party? While newly-wed actor Ranveer Singh rode in alone, we also spotted Arjun Kapoor driving with Malaika Arora and Sanjay Kapoor, Natasha Poonawalla making an entrance with husband Adar Poonawalla, and Amrita Arora Ladak striking a pose for the cameras with Shakeel Ladak. One of the youngest faces at the bash included Ananya Panday, whose parents Chunky and Bhavana Panday also dropped by. 
With a guest list like that, it comes as no surprise that the Sidhwanis' Christmas bash was full of unmissable moments, and some exciting party pictures too. One of the best of the evening was shared by Sanjay Kapoor, and shows Arjun Kapoor, Malaika Arora, Anu and Sunny Dewan, Amrita Arora Ladak and Shakeel Ladak all posing together. 
And that's not where it ends. Through the course of the evening, Ranveer Singh also took a selfie with Amrita Arora Ladak, Kanika Kapoor enjoyed a Christmas feast with other guests, Farhan Akhtar was seen spending time with Mouni Roy and Shibani Dandekar, and Sidharth Malhotra jumped into a groufie with Karan Johar and Nandita Mahtani. Dressed in their festive best, most of the women favoured bold metallics at the Sidhwani residence. While Amrita Arora Ladak went all-out in that sequinned, multicoloured dress, Natasha Poonawalla picked a silver blouse for the occasion and Ananya Panday drove into the party in a shimmering purple outfit. But all eyes were on the ladies in red. From Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Malaika Arora to Anu Dewan and hostess for the evening Dolly Sidhwani, fiery red dresses were the pick of the night. Did you miss this twinning snapshot of Sidhwani and Arora? 
What were Ranveer Singh, Ekta Kapoor and Neha Dhupia up to at this Christmas party? Catch up via our slideshow.

Can you keep up with them? 
There's no debate that 2018 turned out to be full of celebrity weddings and aww-worthy Instagram posts. Whether it was Ranveer Singh fixing Deepika Padukone's sari at their Bengaluru reception, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor's strong Instagram game or Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's memorable red carpet kiss, this year was nothing short of magical in the realm of celebrity love stories. Whether they were spotted showering love on their partners via their social media handles or indulging in some cute red carpet moments, the most popular couples in Bollywood and Hollywood were on their relationship A-game in 2018. 
While some A-listers decided to give us FOMO via their Instagram posts, others went all out on the red carpet. Leading the group were #DeepVeer, who never fail to cheer their fans up by delivering (almost unattainable) couple goals. Ranveer Singh has always been very public in his display of love for Deepika Padukone, and their reception was certainly not the place he was going to change things—the actor was seen fixing Padukone's sari at the event in an adorable, dare we say, husband-like, gesture. Sonam K Ahuja's wedding celebrations showed how the actor's husband, Anand Ahuja, is all about shining the spotlight on his wife—he did so at their wedding reception too. Meanwhile, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have only been serving us with more and more cute moments—be it with their Karva Chauth pictures or Kohli's post, captioned “Day out with my beauty! 🤩”. And who could forget Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Nick Jonas' adorable wedding moments—from their envy-inducing wedding pictures to that sweet speech at their Mumbai engagement. 
2018 also graced us with a handful of newly confirmed couples, such as Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor, and Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalal. It came as no surprise when, after months of speculation, Brahmāstra co-stars Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor made their relationship official by walking in at Sonam K Ahuja and Anand Ahuja's wedding reception together. Bhatt also made sure to share the picture-perfect moment with her fans by Instagramming it. Varun Dhawan, on the other hand, made his declared his love on the sets of Koffee with Karan, and even got his fans gushing when he posted an aww-worthy picture on Instagram from his Diwali celebrations. 
As it turns out, it wasn't just our favourite Bollywood couples who felt the cupid's bow this year. On the international turf, Kanye West brought out his playful side with Kim Kardashian while attending Versace's autumn/winter 2019 show in New York, while Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds continued teasing their fans with public PDA at red carpet events. But Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik still remain our favourites—the couple not only twinned at multiple occasions, but also posted some romantic pictures on their social media feeds. And the model's sister Bella Hadid wasn't too far either—that birthday picture she posted with singer boyfriend, The Weeknd, got her fans obsessing over her on-again off-again relationship. 
Whether it's the celebrities who don't mind sharing some of their personal moments with the world, or our very efficient paparazzi, who capture just the right moments when these pairs are out in public, that we have to thank, we're glad that the following pictures exist on the internet today. Scroll through our edit of the most adorable moments from Bollywood and Hollywood's cutest couples in 2018.

What could be the source of the LOLs? 
If there was a face that could launch a thousand ships in 2018, it would be Deepika Padukone's. Having had an exceptionally good year what with her Cannes 2018 appearances, making it to Time's 100 Most Influential list and her beautiful Lake Como wedding, it's safe to say Ms Padukone is in good spirits. One might even say exceptionally good spirits—so much so that we didn't have to go too deep into our archives to pull out moments of her looking like she's having the time of her life. 
When you're marrying the love of your life in an Italian villa that served as a film set, surrounded by those you cherish the most, chances are you're going to be beaming every single minute of the day. But it's not just the wedding that had Padukone flashing her biggest, brightest smile. The actor seems to be having a good laugh whenever she's on the go too. If you've kept a track on her airport style, you might notice that the accessory she favours the most is that 100-watt smile. Sometimes, it's a giggle and occasionally, raucous laughter. 
The entire scenario begs of answers. Who is narrating jokes to the actor every time she steps out of a car? Is Ranveer Singh really that funny? And how can we be in on this feel-good scheme? On the first episode of the new season of Koffee with Karan, Alia Bhatt and Karan Johar had the same question as us. Padukone, who started off her career as a Close-Up model, only laughed some more in response. In case you need further proof on the matter, or just some sunshine, here's a gallery of Deepika Padukone laughing her way through 2018.

This baby has got everyone’s heart 
Just as Nick Jonas has officially become the country's ‘national jiju', Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi could easily be India's national baby, and if you've been tracking the toddler on social media, you're likely to agree. Born on December 20, 2016, the youngest member of the Pataudi family (who celebrates his second birthday today) has been an Instagram obsession since the day his first picture was shared online. All rosy cheeks, unruly curls, and gorgeous grey eyes, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan's only child has managed to effortlessly create a soft spot in many a fan's hearts, and this year alone, has filled our feeds with some adorable (and hilarious) candid moments from his life. 
Back in January 2018, a chubby-cheeked Taimur was first seen at Mumbai airport bundled up in his mother's arms, and a scroll through our gallery will have you wondering how he grew up so quickly. In February, one of Taimur Ali Khan's cutest snapshots showed him closely observing a picture of his father (don't miss his tiny ponytail!) and during Mumbai's muggy summer months, he had everyone's attention with his super sweet poolside pictures. Dressed in tiny swimming trunks, Taimur Ali Khan is likely to have inspired the summer wardrobes of thousands of little boys in the country. 
As the year progressed, we saw little Taimur jump from that half-up, half-down hairstyle to a sharper cut, and when he turned up for Sonam K Ahuja's wedding ceremony in that tiny kurta and slicked back hair, he sealed his spot as 2018's cutest baraati. How does one top that? Scroll through our favourite pictures and you'll find some gems—the time when Taimur Ali Khan copied Kareena Kapoor Khan's trademark pout, the time he got his nanny to chase him around, and the time he introduced his mother to a cat he'd just met... the list is pretty extensive. And whether he's celebrating Raksha Bandhan with his cousins, being hauled off to playschool or entering the airport sitting on his dad's shoulders, there's little in this tiny celebrity's photo archive that will not have you grinning. 
While followers wait to see more of the little nawab who's currently celebrating his second birthday with his parents in South Africa (“Kareena and I will be shooting an ad in Cape Town for a luggage brand. After that we are going to ride horses and see some big cats for Tim's birthday,” Saif Ali Khan recently revealed in an interview), here's a look back at some of Taimur Ali Khan's cutest moments from 2018. Expect lots of happy jumping, intense sports sessions and some major baby wardrobe inspiration ahead.

Newly-minted couple of the moment, Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Nick Jonas recently wed in an extravagant ceremony in Jodhpur. Nearly two weeks after the glamorous nuptials, Jonas spoke about his future plans, and they included an impending fatherhood. “I definitely want to be a father someday,” Jonas said on Spotify's The Rewind with Guy Raz. He spoke about his experience as a teenage superstar, shot suddenly into stardom as a member of the band Jonas Brothers that he started with his family. “I think that's a real dream, and I think I've had to grow up pretty quick. With that, you could look at it two ways. You could say that was unfair or you could say it's given me some real perspective at an early age and I've seen a lot of life at an early age, and I hope to be able to share that with a kid of my own someday." 
Jonas is a doting uncle to his brother Kevin Jonas' two girls—Alena Rose, 4, and Valentina Angelina, 2. A recent photograph on Instagram shows him playing the keys with the girls, which he captioned, “My beautiful nieces teaching me everything I know on the keys." 
Back in August, Jonas told Cosmopolitan that he'd gotten enough practice with his nieces. The best part about being an uncle is that it's like training wheels,” he said. “You get to spend time with these young people and have some responsibility, which is nice.” In the same interview, Jonas told the magazine, “I am not sure of the exact timeline. But, I need to give my nieces cousins at some point.” In fact, it looks like Jonas is hanging out with his wife's youngest family members as well. In October, Chopra Jonas posted a photo of her husband holding her new nephew. 
As for Chopra Jonas? Building a family has been on her mind for a long time. Back in February, she told India Today, “Marriage and kids are a big goal for me. I'm a big believer in the institution of marriage and in the family, and in kids, I want to have a lot of them, if God allows. The only problem is, I don't know who I'll do it with.” It looks like she has the ‘who' part locked down now! She's had practice with her nieces and nephews, and she's also been a dog mom to her famous pup, Diana. 
After a fun-filled mehandi and sangeet, on December 2, the two were married in a Western ceremony at the Umaid Bhavan Palace. The bride wore an embroidered Ralph Lauren gown that had her groom's name, the names of her parents, her wedding date as well as a piece of Jonas' mother's wedding gown sewn into it. It was a family affair that saw Jonas' brothers and their significant others with Chopra's brother and both their nephews and nieces in the bridal party. The day after, the couple exchanged vows again in a traditional Hindu ceremony. 
Post the wedding functions, Chopra Jonas returned back to work promoting the initiation of popular dating app, Bumble in India. They then flew off to Oman for a little trip, before coming back to India to attend their friend, Isha Ambani's wedding celebrations to Anand Piramal. Safe to say, they've had a busy few weeks since the wedding. 
If we're going by her comments about her friend Meghan Markle's pregnancy, baby time may come sooner rather than later for the Jonases. She told People, “I would, as a friend, just say that I'm really excited for her. I think this is a new phase in every woman's life and I hope hers is as amazing as she wants it to be.”

“It feels like it happened just yesterday” 
It's hard to believe that it's already been a year since Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's dreamy wedding. The duo, who are easily one of the country's most-followed celebrity couples, tied the knot last year in a private ceremony in Tuscany, surrounded by no one but their closest family members and friends. And since making things official, #Virushka have opened up about their love for one another on more than one occasion. To mark their first wedding anniversary, the couple has shared the sweetest posts on their social media feeds, including some unseen pictures from the wedding and a video. Here's a look at what Virat Kohli had to say about his wife on the special occasion. 
Currently in Australia with his wife, Virat Kohli began the day of December 11 by sharing an album of unseen pictures from his beautiful wedding day. The album, shared in honour of his and Anushka Sharma's first wedding anniversary, shows Kohli holding his bride in his arms, and also includes pictures of the moment when Kohli filled Sharma's hair with sindoor, and the couple's pheras. “Can't believe it's been a year already because it feels like it happened just yesterday,” Kohli captioned the romantic anniversary post. “Time has truly flown by. Happy anniversary to my best friend and my soulmate.Mine forever ❤ @anushkasharma”

Just like her husband, Anushka Sharma decided to celebrate her wedding anniversary by sharing unseen glimpses of her special day with the world. Instead of a photo album, the Bollywood star posted a little video clip from her wedding festivities. The video shows a glowing Sharma (dressed in that pastel Sabyasachi bridal lehenga) walking towards her groom and her mandap, and also includes snippets of Virat Kohli's post-wedding speech. “My wife... Can I say that again? My wife! I feel like I was a child in the morning and now I've grown up,” Kohli says in the video, before smiling at Anushka Sharma and saying once more, “My wife.” Watch the video of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's wedding and you'll also catch a peek at the couple's varmala ceremony, and the most adorable moment of them all, when Kohli gives his bride a little kiss post the pheras. 
In Anushka Sharma's words, “It's heaven, when you don't sense time passing by ... It's heaven, when you marry a good ‘man' ... 💞”. Catch a peek at all the sweet throwback moments from Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's wedding below.

And it was everything you thought it would be 
When Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal hosted a lavish engagement ceremony for their friends and family in Lake Como earlier this year, guests were treated to a performance by John Legend. Needless to say, the bar was already set high for the couple's wedding festivities. Rumour mills were abuzz for months with speculation on who would attend the extravaganza in Udaipur, and Beyoncé's name had popped up a fair bit. But it wasn't until the paparazzi caught a glimpse of her wild curls at the airport, that we were certain of her presence at the ceremony. 
Beyoncé arrived with her entourage and mother Tina Knowles earlier on Saturday to prepare for the performance. The Ambani and Piramal families have been stringent about maintaining privacy during Isha and Anand's wedding events, and guests were not allowed to post social media updates from the venue. However, a few videos and images have surfaced from the evening, including the pictures Beyoncé herself posted on her feed, and we now know that the multi-award winning singer-songwriter had several outfit changes last night. 
Look one was a sultry maroon gown covered in mirror work along with a matha patti, haath phool and jhumkis by PinkCity by Anita Dongre for a modernised take on royal India. In case the look reminds you of Beyoncé from the ‘Hymn For The Weekend' video, you're right on track—this ensemble too, was created for the star by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. For her second look on-stage, she picked a beaded gold bodysuit by Falguni Shane Peacock, who have also dressed her previously. In a third look, Queen Bey picked a high-cut bejewelled swimsuit with raffia sleeves by Shivan & Narresh. It's evident that Beyoncé wanted to pay a nod to the country's design talent through her wardrobe for the night. 
What's a private Beyoncé concert without her famous hits? ‘Crazy In Love', ‘Naughty Girl' and ‘Perfect' were some of the numbers that had people dancing during an event called The Palace Soirée, on the second night of Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's pre-wedding celebrations. 
Giving 2018 the biggest, grandest wedding of the year, the Ambani family has left no stone unturned in making the celebration unforgettable. With sets designed by Manish Malhotra, chartered flights to Udaipur from all over the country and the likes of Hillary Clinton in attendance, Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's wedding will be talked about for years to come. The couple will tie the knot on the December 12 at the Ambani family's Mumbai residence, Antilia. Thus far, their pre-wedding festivities have included a maha aarti, a sangeet, a mela with a “phoolon ki holi” or a Holi with flowers, and a Palace Soirée. 
Can't believe you didn't get to see Beyoncé perform in India? Scroll through our slideshow for some of the glimpses from last night.

Can you believe he’s already two? 
Ever since the day his first picture hit the internet, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, son of Kareena Kapoor Khan and husband Saif Ali Khan, has been a social media sensation. Whether the toddler's sleeping on his way to Switzerland, spending time with his mom on set or attending a wedding with his family, the tiny nawab always manages to steal the spotlight. It comes as no surprise, then, that when he turned one last December, pictures from his regal birthday celebration in Pataudi spread through Instagram like wild fire. And honestly, could expect anything less for his second birthday? 
Though Taimur Ali Khan's birthday falls on December 20, his parents hosted an early birthday bash for him today in Mumbai, and the pictures prove that Taimur's second birthday was just as good (if not better) than his first. There to bring in his big day were aunts Karisma Kapoor and Soha Ali Khan Pataudi, grandmother Babita Kapoor, and cousins Kiaan Raj Kapur, Samaira Kapur and Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. Joining them for the occasion were Kunal Kemmu, Amrita Arora Ladak and Tushar Kapoor's son Laksshya Kapoor. Given that his last birthday included a pony ride, carousels and a huge jungle-themed cake, one can expect that this party will be full of adorable accessories, games and more. We've already spotted a gorgeous orange sports car and a gifts decorated with blue balloons being ushered into the party venue! 
While hostess for the evening Kareena Kapoor Khan kept her look casual for the occasion in a white tee and flared trousers, Arora Ladak picked a striped dress cinched in with a Gucci belt, and Karisma Kapoor made a case for pussybow blouses. Catch up on all the pictures released so far below.

The star reveals all in her very first post-wedding interview 
Priyanka Chopra is one busy bride. Just days after tying the knot with Nick Jonas in not one, but two fairy-tale wedding ceremonies, the star flew to Delhi for her wedding reception and a special event for the social and dating app, Bumble. On the evening of December 5, Chopra and Jonas made their very first red carpet appearance as a married couple, and #Nickyanka fans couldn't stop talking about their loved up-pictures, and the bride's east-meets-west look. Dressed in a nude Ralph & Russo dress, a glowing Chopra brought two very different aesthetics together by accessorising her Western ensemble with traditional Hindu chooda (bridal bangles), her mangalsutra and a touch of sindoor. Post the event, the superstar sat down for her very first post-wedding interview with Ambika Anand, where she discussed her love for technology, her larger-than-life wedding, and her new husband, Nick Jonas. Here are some of our favourite quotes from the conversation. 
If you've been scrolling through Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' wedding album, you may already know that their Christian wedding was full of romantic moments. For the bride, that walk towards the altar was an unforgettable one. “I was definitely nervous and scared,” she revealed. “I've spoken in front of heads of state, I've been on some of the most prolific stages in the world, but I was most afraid on this day! I think the most special moment was when the curtains opened and I saw him [Jonas] for the first time right at the altar and I was going to walk out... everything felt right. I think that for me was the most overwhelming moment, I was just like ‘Life's great, nothing to worry about'.” One of the sweetest videos from this day shows Nick Jonas wiping away a tear as he watches Priyanka Chopra make her way towards him. The bride was given away by her mother Madhu Chopra, with whom she shares a very special bond. 
If you've been wondering which side of the family was more prepared for the festivities, you've now got the answer. “Have you not noticed that the American family is much bigger than the Indian family this time?” Chopra said. “The Jonases travel in packs! We were intimidated by them this time, they really were prepared I must say.” 
Actor, musician, business woman... Priyanka Chopra is a woman of many talents, and the Jonas family is full of fans of her work. With more than 50 movies to her name, it's hard to pick just one favourite, but the Jonases have managed to make the choice. “Barfi! and Mary Kom,” the newly-wed revealed with a little smile. “These are two that I think they've watched, but more than that it's just been the songs, like ‘Ram Chahe Leela' and ‘Desi Girl', they know all the hook steps. It was shocking! ‘Gallan Goodiyan'... they know all the steps to everything, it's amazing!" 
Each couple paves their own unique path, and Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are bound to do the same. During the interview, however, the bride spotlighted two couples who she and Jonas will always look up to. “His parents and my parents have had incredible marriages. They've had their mountains and valleys but have been very supportive to each other. I think that's what we look up to. God has been a very integral part of both of our lives and so have our families, our big, fat, ginormous families and we love that; that's our inspiration really to be able to have that all our lives.” 
Priyanka Chopra's bridal gown was no ordinary dress, and it comes with a story. During her interview, the actor revealed more details about the hand-embroidered, hand-beaded Ralph Lauren number that's taken the internet by storm. “For me it was not about the fashion, it wasn't about what it will look like in the picture. I just wanted something that was unique, because I think I am unique in the way I think. So both my dresses, my white dress and my red dress were very personalised to me. I had names, dates, my parents' names, things that mattered to me, my mother in law's wedding dress embroidered on my dress, I had ‘Om Namah Shivai' written on my dress... compassion, love... the fact that they ended up being something that other women have admired is great. I really wanted the longest veil in the world and I got that!" 
Though many expected to see Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas to head straight for a honeymoon post their wedding, the couple seem to be busy with many projects at the moment. But where will they eventually head for some alone time? “I have no idea!” she said. “Right now I have just work commitments this month, with shooting and doing a lot of work with Bumble and ad commitments... I don't know, we still haven't figured out where. I think it's going to be a surprise though, I think that's what my husband's planning,” she laughs. 
“My work and Nick's work are very important to us. There's no free lunches in the world and we've both worked very hard to be where we are and we don't take it for granted,” Chopra said. “My commitments matter to me a lot, my word is my bond and we had decided to do this a long time ago, before I knew I was getting married, and so I stuck to my commitment [the Bumble event]. But besides that, it's something I'm very excited about as well. I would just tell brides out there, whatever your priority is, it's right. If your priority is work, that's right. If your priority is honeymoon, that's right. As newly-weds, it's really your turn. You get to do whatever you want. With us, these were the choices we took that worked for us.” 
The bride also spoke out about her latest investments, and why she chose to support the social and dating app. “When we were sitting at this Bumble business dinner I was seeing the presentation with everyone. I was sitting with Whitney and I told her, ‘I don't know, being a woman from India I think this would be a really great platform, or it will be a really amazing thing for Indian women to have, their arsenal—which would give them a sense of empowerment because it is on their terms.' It is basically choosing your life, the way you want to and being the best version of it—whether that is in love, whether that is in business, whether that is in your friendships or the kind of network you want around you and the people you want around you.” 
Technology is another point of interest for Chopra. “I am a tech fan. I always loved technology. It's really taking the world to heights and places and it is bringing the world closer and I think the young people need this opportunity to be able to monetise their ideas of the currency of today. I feel like tech lends itself for that... I like to do things out of the box a little. I was at a dinner for Bumble business because I just thought it was such an incredible platform which is a social network site for women... by women for everyone. It is such a unique thought. It gives women precedence, it gives their choices precedence and safety and it is for anyone who wants to be a part of the social network.” Scroll ahead to take a look at the video.

This one was a rager 
It's been close to two weeks since Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh tied the knot at Lake Como, and last night, the newly-weds finally brought their wedding celebrations to a close at Mumbai's Grand Hyatt hotel. If you've been tracking the #DeepVeer wedding, you'll agree that the superstar couple saved the best for last when it came to their parties. The reception that took place last night brought together almost all of Bollywood's biggest stars, from Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Kareena Kapoor Khan to Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan, Anushka Sharma and many more. With so many icons in one room, the night had to be an unforgettable one, and these inside pictures and videos serve as proof. Here's a look at everything that went down last night. 
He may be new to the whole husband game, but Ranveer Singh seems to already have figured marriage out. At his reception last night, the actor made a speech that Shilpa Shetty Kundra's husband Raj Kundra managed to capture on Instagram. “The key to success in life is to say yes to everything that she says,” Singh shared with his guests last night. “So when baby says, ‘Baby, change the vibe of the music,' I have to oblige!” Sounds pretty on-point. 
If there's one thing expected from Ranveer Singh at his star-studded Mumbai reception, it has to be some killer dance moves. Last night, the groom—who is known to love a good Hindi dance number—took over the dance floor with some of Bollywood's most-loved stars, and the videos are already all over social media. While one shows the actor grooving to ‘Chaiyya Chaiyya' with the original stars of the video, Shah Rukh Khan and Malaika Arora, another shows him busting a move with none other than Amitabh Bachchan to ‘Jumma Chumma'. How does one keep up with all that energy? Bride Deepika Padukone smartly picked a Zuhair Murad gown that converts into a manageable knee-length dress for the occasion, and even switched her strappy red heels for a pair of white sneakers in the middle of the night to keep up with her enthusiastic groom, who also switched from his Rohit Gandhi Rahul Khanna tux into a more dance-friendly tiger print jacket. 
No party is complete without an Insta-worthy picture, and no one agrees with this more than the Indian film industry. While Karisma Kapoor put up a picture of herself giving the Ranveer Singh a tight hug, Vidya Balan spent her evening dancing with Rekha and catching up with Jaya Bachchan. One star who made sure to get pictures with all her favourite people was Sophie Choudry. Scroll through our gallery to see more pictures of Sonakshi Sinha, Dia Mirza, Aditi Rao Hydari and others at the festivities.

The actor reveals details about her bachelorette, the Lake Como weddings, and why she chose Ranveer Singh as her husband 
It's been just about two weeks since Deepika Padukone tied the knot with beau Ranveer Singh, and the newly-weds have managed create a buzz all over the globe with their flawless wedding pictures, their regal wedding wardrobes, and of course, all those loved-up moments from their celebrations. And though the duo's long list of receptions (they had one in Bengaluru, and then three in Mumbai) has now come to a close, everyone's excitement around them shows no signs of dying down anytime soon. If you, like so many others, want more #DeepVeer details, you've got some good news coming your way. The new bride just found herself on the cover of GQ India's December 2018 issue, and the cover story has her talking about everything from the bachelorette you never knew about, to life after saying ‘I do', and how her relationship with Singh has evolved over the years. Here are some of our favourite snippets. 
“With Ranveer and me, our relationship rests on the fact that we're extremely liberal with each other, extremely supportive of each other's professional careers and know each other's personal needs. I think when we started dating six years ago, professionally, we were both in very different places. My career took off slightly before his, but throughout our relationship, right from 2013—even when I was shooting for [Goliyon Ki Rasleela] Ram-Leela and Chennai Express—nothing has changed.” 
“I think you just know when you want to spend the rest of your life with that one person—and he's everything rolled into one man. He's my best friend, playmate, companion and confidant. I can be silly in front of him, I can be stupid in front of him, I can be sick in front of him, I can be whatever I want to be.” 
“He is vulnerable, extremely emotional, very intelligent; childlike at times. That's not to say that his irrepressible energy isn't him, it's very him. He's a real people's person, but there's a quiet side to him too. Emotionally, I think I'm the more intuitive one. I'd say IQ is more him. But at the same time, he's not all like, “I'm a man, I can't show my emotions.” He's sensitive, and so am I, and it makes it easier to share a life with someone who understands that.” 
“The bachelors crashed my bachelorette! Eventually, it became one big party with all our friends. We were in Orlando for a week and the aim was to get on the scariest roller coasters, to feel that rush of adrenaline, like you're flying. We went on the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit [at Universal Studios], which Ellen DeGeneres posted about a while back. And the VR Avatar rides [at Disney's Animal Kingdom], for which we had to stand in line for two-and-a-half to three hours, were phenomenal.” 
“I think the pictures we shared [on social media] summed up the wedding—it was magical to have just family and friends there who mean something to you, who don't really care about who you are professionally, but are there because they love you for who you are as a person. People who've seen you grow, been part of your journey and are genuinely happy for you.” 
“Several of my parents' friends said that they were surprised we greeted every single guest. They thought we'd make a ten-minute appearance and leave. Apparently, other celebs have done that—but that's not how he and I would ever do it.” 
“Well, I've been running a home since I was 18, so I don't think much is going to change in that sense. But of course, we'll go through all the changes that happen when two people start living together. I was clear right from the start that I didn't want to have a live-in relationship to figure out if I wanted to marry someone or not. Now [I'm expecting] everything that comes with being a newly-wed: sharing space, you know, or the bills, whatever it takes for two people to live a life together.”

Did you see what they wore? 
If you've been keeping up with all things related to Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding, you'd be aware that the newly-wed couple is currently busy with their post-wedding celebrations. After hosting multiple reception parties, the couple were spotted seeking Lord Ganesha's blessings at Mumbai's Siddhivinayak Temple this afternoon. The duo was also accompanied by their respective family members for this outing, including Prakash and Ujjala Padukone, Jagjit Singh Bhavani and Anju Bhavnani, Anisha Padukone and Ritika Bhavnani. Fans will remember that this is not the first time the couple was spotted at the temple together—the two made a visit right before the release of their film, Padmavaat, at the beginning of the year too. 
From airport outfits and their Lake Como nuptials to their most recent Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and Rohit Bal ensembles, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have been serving goals in twinning with your special one right from the start of their wedding celebrations. For their most recent visit to Siddhivinayak temple, the newly-wed couple once again coordinated in ivory Sabyasachi outfits. While Singh looked dapper in a nude-toned kurta and pyjama set, worn with a matching jacket, Padukone picked an anarkali in a complementary earthy hue, which came with an embroidered dupatta that made the highlight of her look. The Chennai Express actor accessorised with a pair of gold chaandbalis and beige juttis, and went with a day-appropriate beauty look to round it all off, featuring a casual pulled-back hairstyle, nude lips and dewy makeup. Scroll  below to see more from Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's Siddhivinayak visit.

Are you ready for a part two? 
Netflix addicts are no strangers to the American teen romance, To All The Boys I've Loved Before, which first hit trending charts this August. The rom-com touched hearts all over the globe, be it for Korean-American character Lara Jean Covey's totally relatable dating dilemmas, or Peter Kavinky's boy-next-door charm. And if you (like so many of us) are guilty of overdosing on TATBILB memes, songs and re-runs, there's some good news coming your way—the teen movie is all set to get a sequel! 
If you're a die-hard fan of the film, you may already know that TATBILB was based on the first of three books written by American author Jenny Han. While To All The Boys I've Loved Before ended on a happy note (spoiler: Lara Jean, played by Lana Conder, and Peter, played by Noah Centineo, end up together), it looks like their romantic escapades are far from over. The sequel is likely to showcase all the drama from book two, P.S. I Still Love You, and book three, Always and Forever, Lara Jean. 
Though no release date has been shared yet, rumour has it that Paramount Pictures will be teaming up with Netflix for the sequel of To All The Boys I've Loved Before. Why? According to Netflix, this movie is already one of its “most viewed original films ever” and no surprises here, has earned “strong repeat viewing”. An article by The Hollywood Reporter also stated, “One of the first movies being discussed for the Paramount-Netflix deal will be a sequel to To All the Boys I've Loved Before.” 
If you're still not familiar with TATBILB (how?), the movie tells the hilarious story of a girl whose secret love letters get mailed to each of her five crushes, and has got to be on your must-watch list for the weekend. And if the first film is anything to go by, we can all expect lots of heart-warming romantic moments, high school madness and of course, heavy doses of Yakult in the second edition. Can't wait? Here's a look at some of the film's cutest moments and memes to help tide you through.

Cannot get enough of these two! 
This month, all anyone can talk about in India is Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding. After dating for six years, the couple finally tied the knot in a grand celebration away from the public eye in Lake Como, but returned to India to meet all their family and friends in a handful of post-wedding celebrations. Why Lake Como of all places? Singh shared the answer with an Indian publication recently: “Whatever [Deepika] wished, I wanted her to have it. That's the first step in being the husband of the millennium. Whatever her vision of getting married, I wanted her to realise it. Whatever she wanted, it was done exactly in that manner. She deserves every bit of it. I too deserve happiness and my happiness comes from her happiness. It's that simple.” 
After making an appearance at Deepika Padukone's hometown, Bengaluru first, the newly-weds were seen celebrating their big moment with the Bhavnani family's favourite people at Mumbai's Grand Hyatt hotel too. But that wasn't the end of the #DeepVeer celebrations! On November 28, Padukone and Singh came together once again for their official Mumbai reception in perfectly coordinated ivory and gold ensembles, and their flawless pictures have already made it to every bride-to-be's Pinterest board. 
While you've probably already seen Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's Instagram posts, you may have missed out on the candid snapshots of the couple during this event. Here's a peek at all the moments you missed from last night. 
Each time Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have been spotted post their wedding, they've given romantics all over the country something to smile about. When the two returned to India after their Konkani ceremony and Anand Karaj in Italy, #DeepVeer fans couldn't stop talking about Singh's romantic mehandi design (a little diya with ‘Deepika' written under it) and at their Bengaluru reception, pictures of Singh adjusting Padukone's sari took over the internet like wildfire. At their Mumbai reception, the couple had eyes only for one another and one of their cutest moments from the evening had to be the moment when Singh gave his new wife a kiss on the hand. “I'm lucky to have her. I knew all too well that this is the woman I'm going to marry,” Singh revealed. “This is the woman who would become the mother of my children. I've been thinking about marriage seriously for almost three years now. I was just waiting, I told her the minute you say so, we'll do it.” 
They may look like Greek statues in their latest pictures, but even Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone need a break from the perfection. Between poses, the goofy groom was spotted busting a move on stage, and the glowing bride was seen cracking up upon being called “bhabhi ji (sister-in-law)” by the paparazzi. The couple were gifted a very special bouquet by their photographers for the occasion, and they made sure to take several pictures with the customised present too. Post meeting their guests, the reception transformed into a dance party. Want to know which songs Singh was playing from the console?

Your chance to meet the most adorable puppies and kittens in the city 
Picture this: a human being asleep on a tiny couch, a pile of blankets and a tiny but chubby dog perched on the human-duvet pyramid. Due to ongoing renovations at home, and the lack of a bedroom, this has been my sleeping arrangement for the last week or so. And while I couldn't move for fear of toppling over my little bunny, I wouldn't have it any other way. The love I have for my dog is pretty much the closest I've come to unconditional love—and whether it's their ability to share boundless love, the endless joy they bring to a home, or just their adorable furry faces, only a pet lover can truly identify with this feeling. 
For the last eight years, World For All Animal Care and Adoptions (WFA), an animal welfare NGO has been hosting an Adoptathon every year, uniting prospective pet owners with their furry soulmates. This time, the event will be held on December 1 and December 2, and will bring together 180 fully vaccinated, groomed and healthy Indian breed puppies and kittens up for adoption, making this Asia's Largest Pet Adoption Camp. Once the adoption process is complete, WFA will continue to assist the new parents by keeping in touch and providing any necessary animal care and assistance. (Just ask our managing editor, Renuka Modi, who adopted her dog—the hazel-eyed Obi Wan Modi from WFA in early 2017). 
For those who are pet parents already, the Adoptathon 2018 will have a range of stalls to keep your pets (and you) happy—from hand-made organic products from Happy Puppy, gourmet biscuits and treats from Spoilt Brat Barkery, food for your pets from Pedigree and Whiskas, and lots more. Don't miss this!

All the pictures you need to see 
This weekend was a time for celebrations all around. While Mumbai kept busy with weddings, in Hyderabad, renowned philanthropist and art aficionado Sudha Reddy brought in her birthday with a glamorous soirée. 
To ring in her 40th birthday, Reddy hosted the celebration at Hyderabad's sprawling Hitex International Convention and Exhibition Center on November 24. Bathed in hues of black and blue, the venue reflected the hostess' taste and personal style. The guestlist included eminent personalities from both the social and fashion circuits, featuring names such as Princess Krishna Kumari, Pinky Reddy, Sheetal Mafatlal, Neeta Lulla, Raghavendra Rathore and Falguni and Shane Peacock—many of whom flew in from different parts of the world to accompany Reddy on her big day. 
The evening was curated by Aarti Surendranath, and executed by Khushi Singh Choudhary. Some of the highlights were fashion showcases by international couture names like João Rôlo, Elie Madi and Amato Couture, followed by the ritual cutting of the cake by Reddy. Also on the agenda was an elaborate sit-down dinner—curated specially by chef Ritu Dalmia, who deftly demonstrated her grasp of Mediterranean cuisine. As the party neared its end, a roster of performers from the European live band, Paris Select, churned out melodies, proving that there could not have been a better way to conclude the star-studded night.

Major laser 
With two picturesque wedding ceremonies and a reception ceremony in Bengaluru behind them, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have been the picture of elegance in every picture to come out of the celebrations. Mostly seen in coordinated Indian ethnic looks at airports, the couple have kept the momentum of the wedding excitement alive with their cumulative celebrity. Since only a handful chosen guests made it to their wedding in Lake Como, the duo has been hosting a series of events to share the momentous occasion with their friends and family. Tonight the groom's side of the family (the Bhavnanis) had a big blowout party to mark the occasion of the union, where the guests and the couple let their hair down to celebrate. 
Deepika Padukone's style game is always a notch above her contemporaries. For the big bash, she chose a Sabyasachi lehenga from his latest couture collection that was covered in floral threadwork. Adding to the theme, she wore her hair in a crown braid. A halo of red roses complemented the look. Padukone chose a polki and emerald necklace to add shine to her lehenga. The bride, who took cues from Freida Kahlo's signature beauty look, was for once not coordinated with her beau but rather matching up to his level of extravagance. 
Ranveer Singh, even of his dullest of days, is a dedicated maximalist. After a week of being wearing relatively understated sherwani and kurta pyjama sets, the Simmba star did what he loves doing best—dressed up to match his level of enthusiasm post marriage. Singh who wore Sabyasachi in Italy and Rohit Bal in Bengaluru, wore the most daring of looks created by avant grade design maverick, Manish Arora. The unique look is inspired by Arora's own eclectic and exuberant wardrobe at the Burning Man music festival, which he frequents every year. 
Singh was dressed in a longline jacket featuring glow-in-the-dark heart motifs that are one of Arora's signatures. The sleeves of the jacket were chainmail inspired, with squares of pink linked together. The look was completed with trousers with mini hearts that matched the jacket—talk about wearing your heart on your sleeve. A detachable leopard head, fashioned out of coloured leather, sat on the shoulder of the jacket and wait for it, shot out green laser beams through its eyes. Reminiscent of his Khilji character, the actor wore kohl on his eyes. A specially crafted polki necklace by Amrapali completed the ensemble. 
Ranveer Singh has maintained his individualistic sense of style despite being in an industry that places importance on looking presentable and pleasing the masses. Somehow, Singh has broken the codes and let his personality shine through, making him more endearing; outlandish outfits, laser beams and all. 
No good wedding is complete without a heartfelt speech and last night, Ranveer Singh finally shared his feelings about his big day with his guests. “Ladies and gentlemen, I married the most beautiful girl in the world!” he proudly announced at his Grand Hyatt party. Watch the video of Singh's speech now to see what he said about her striking look. 
Though #DeepVeer fans weren't able to track every moment of the couple's Lake Como wedding, videos and pictures from inside Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's India celebrations are slowly taking over Instagram. Despite tight security, followers have managed to catch glimpses at all the action from the Grand Hyatt party and some of the most exciting videos show an ecstatic Singh taking over the dance floor with his guests. From ‘That Thing You Do!' by The Wonders to Bollywood movie Coolie No. 1's ‘Main Toh Raste Se Ja Raha Tha', the star was spotted busting his beat moves to a handful of happy tracks. The cutest video, however, is one of Singh and Padukone dancing together. Check it out here.

From Yorgos Lanthimos’s brilliantly bawdy period drama The Favourite to Adam McKay’s Dick Cheney biopic Vice, Vogue shortlists the 16 films to watch ahead of awards season 
The 2019 Oscar race is on. So, who will win big at the star-studded ceremony on February 24? The field is wide open, with a host of studio behemoths and indie darlings vying for the Academy's consideration. After a rapturous response at the Venice Film Festival, A Star is Born—including Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper—is set to dominate proceedings. Hot on its heels are Yorgos Lanthimos's period drama The Favourite, Alfonso Cuarón's critically acclaimed Roma and Damien Chazelle's Neil Armstrong biopic First Man. There have been strong performances from recent nominees and winners (Timothée Chalamet in Beautiful Boy, Mahershala Ali in Green Book), as well as a surprise late entry from Adam McKay's Vice, a political satire starring Christian Bale as Dick Cheney. Vogue shortlists the 16 films you should have on your radar ahead of awards season. Ballot papers at the ready...

Fresh from his Best Picture Oscar-win for Moonlight in 2017, Barry Jenkins returns with this dreamy adaptation of James Baldwin's 1974 novel. It's a lush love story marred by tragedy, set on the unforgiving streets of Harlem in the 1970s. Childhood friends Tish and Fonny are newly engaged, but their future is threatened when the latter is falsely accused of a crime. Three-time Emmy award winner Regina King lends her support as Tish's straight-talking mother Sharon, while KiKi Layne and Stephan James shine in the lead roles. Add to this a swooning score and evocative cinematography, and you have a touching examination of race, romance and injustice in modern America. In cinemas on February 8 2019. 
How did a Washington bureaucrat rise through the ranks to become the most powerful US vice president of all time? Adam McKay's follow-up to The Big Short dives into recent history to chart the career of Dick Cheney, played by an almost unrecognisable Christian Bale. Amy Adams is his politically-adept wife Lynne Cheney, Steve Carell is Donald Rumsfeld and Sam Rockwell is a free-wheeling George W. Bush. Zipping from the campaign trail to the White House, the biopic assesses Cheney's impact on the military, the energy industry and foreign policy, to uncover how he laid the foundations for the country's current political crisis. In cinemas on February 1 2019.

Expect extravagant costumes, duck racing, raucous parlour games and a brilliantly bawdy script. This is the period drama redefined. In cinemas on January 1 2019.

Senator Gary Hart's bid to become US president in 1988 ended when rumours surfaced of his infidelity. This fuelled a midnight stakeout, an onslaught of camera crews and tabloid speculation that eventually ended his career. Jason Reitman's depiction of the scandal stars Hugh Jackman as Hart and is adapted from political journalist Matt Bai's book All The Truth Is Out. Reitman's long-time collaborator JK Simmons appears as Hart's campaign manager while Vera Farmiga plays his betrayed wife. Jackman, an Academy favourite who hosted the Oscars in 2009 and was nominated for Les Misérables in 2013, could be the dark horse of this year's race. In cinemas on January 25 2019.

Don't underestimate Timothée Chalamet. After breakout roles in Call Me By Your Name and Lady Bird last year, the heartthrob became the youngest Best Actor nominee in almost 80 years. The latest showcase of his talent is this weighty family drama about a young man coping with crystal meth addiction. Based on two bestselling memoirs by father and son David and Nic Sheff, it shows them on the long road to recovery as they navigate relapse and regret. Steve Carell, playing the tormented father, gives his best performance since Foxcatcher. In cinemas on January 18 2019.

Spike Lee's tour de force about a black police officer who infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan earned him the Grand Prix at Cannes. Despite being set in the 1970s, it feels troubling and timely: cries of “America First!” are self-consciously sprinkled throughout, plus news footage of the 2017 Charlottesville rally woven together with images from Gone With The Wind and The Birth of a Nation. The final product is a blistering indictment of Trump-era white supremacy that demands recognition. Lee has never won a competitive Oscar—an injustice that Academy voters are surely hoping to correct come February. In cinemas now.

The life of Vincent van Gogh has provided indelible subject matter for many a filmmaker: Vincente Minnelli in Lust for Life, Robert Altman in Vincent & Theo, and Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman in last year's Oscar-nominated animation Loving Vincent. Julian Schnabel's new rendering of the artist has a poetic visual style that warmly evokes the Impressionist's best-known works, and centres on a mesmerising performance by Willem Dafoe. In cinemas on February 7 2019.

In 2011, Norway experienced its deadliest terrorist attack to date when the far-right extremist Anders Breivik murdered 77 people in two coordinated attacks. The date of the atrocity has become a byword for unspeakable tragedy, and forms the title of Paul Greengrass's searing dramatisation of the events. It follows Breivik as he travels from the site of his car bomb in Oslo to the island of Utøya, where he intends to kill the children attending the Norwegian Labour party's annual youth summer camp. The film is unflinching in its portrayal of the horror that ensues and the harrowing trial that follows, making for a difficult but necessary watch. On Netflix now.

Paul Dano's directorial debut received a wall of praise after premiering at Sundance. The script, which Dano co-wrote with partner Zoe Kazan, adapts Richard Ford's novella to create a poignant domestic drama about a troubled marriage. It boasts a powerhouse performance by Carey Mulligan who plays Jeanette Brinson, a dutiful 1960s housewife whose world is torn apart when her husband leaves to fight a forest fire that is raging across rural Montana. With impeccable production design and costumes, it also emerges as one of the most stylish films of the year. In cinemas now.

Alfonso Cuarón claimed the Golden Lion at Venice with this love letter to the Mexico City of his youth. Seen through the eyes of a young woman and the family she works for, it captures the political turbulence of the 1970s in pristine black and white. At the heart of the story is Yalitza Aparicio, making her acting debut as the stoic maid Cleo whose personal life is slowly unravelling. Selected as the Mexican entry for this year's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, Roma is unlikely to go home empty handed, but distributor Netflix is angling for the top prize. On Netflix now.

Ryan Gosling is Neil Armstrong in Damien Chazelle's much-anticipated follow-up to La La Land. The Oscar-winning director recreates the 1969 moon landing with painstaking precision, taking visual cues from space-race classics like Ron Howard's Apollo 13. Claire Foy is formidable as Janet Armstrong, while Gosling is solemn and reticent. In his hands, the titular astronaut is no longer the mythologised hero who uttered those immortal words, but a man still grieving the loss of his young daughter Karen and unable to shake off his memory of her even when he is lost in space. In cinemas now.

Growing up in London, Steve McQueen was hooked on Lynda La Plante's 1983 TV mini-series Widows, which told the story of four women who attempt an audacious heist to pay off a debt left behind by their dead husbands. McQueen's heart-thumping remake stars Viola Davis, Michelle Rodrigues, Elizabeth Debicki and Carrie Coon, with standout supporting roles from Daniel Kaluuya and Colin Farrell. A tonal shift from the British auteur's arty oeuvre (Hunger, Shame, 12 Years a Slave), it's a rip-roaring thriller with plenty of plot twists, penned by McQueen and Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn. In cinemas now.

With its emotionally-charged soundtrack and timeless tale of love doomed by fame, A Star is Born is the juggernaut of awards season. The only question is, just how many statuettes will it take home on Oscar night? Lady Gaga is likely to walk away with Best Original Song for the rousing power-ballad Shallow and will go up against the likes of Olivia Colman and Melissa McCarthy in the Best Actress category for her big-screen debut. Bradley Cooper will battle it out for Best Actor and Director, while Sam Elliott leads a crowded field for Best Supporting Actor. In cinemas now.

After strong turns in two of last year's Best Picture nominees (Lady Bird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), rising star Lucas Hedges takes centre stage in Joel Edgerton's sensitive depiction of a teenager in Arkansas forced to attend a gay conversion therapy camp. Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe play his devoutly Christian parents, struggling to come to terms with their son's sexuality. It's a worthy coming-of-age drama highlighting a cruel practice that is still legal in 36 US states. In cinemas on February 8 2019.

Aditi Rao Hydari Beauty Evolution 
Aditi Rao Hydari made an appearance on the Bollywood film circuit in 2008 with a cameo in Delhi 6 and has worked with the likes of Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar ever since. You won't see a single Instagram selfie of hers without her flawless skin and groomed straight Korean-style brows. We go back right to the start to see how the actor's beauty look has evolved over the years. 
The beginning In 2012, the year right after her first lead role in a Bollywood film Yeh Saali Zindagi, she was seen sporting the '90s skinny brows and balmy pink lips. Come 2014 and Hydari's look transitioned from no make-up to base-heavy, with filled-in brows, smudged eyeliner and lashes for days. She also started pulling back her hair into buns, ponytails and messy braids coupled with pinks or reds on her lips. 
Coming into her own In 2015, her brows switched up as they got thicker on the insides and tapered on the outsides, while she picked pink as a frequent lip colour and swapped her eyeliner for lengthy lashes and hints of blush. She took her hair game up a notch with various styles like a slicked-back ponytail, blown out curls, crown braids and side swept dos. Smoky eyes were a frequent look as well, it was the only time she brought the eyeliner back into her beauty kit. 
Her signature look The year of 2016 saw her brows entirely transform to becoming thick all over and a little shorter as well. For make-up, the actor moved away from her bright lip colours and opted for fresh nude skin, bold arches and long lashes—a look that eventually became her signature. 
Then and now Coming back to this year, her brows are now the straight Korean kind, her skin is clean and dewy, no sight of the dark circles from 2012 and her eyelashes are always speaking volumes. While she does take to bright lips from time to time, her hairstyles are mostly the basics that always work in her favour and her number of no make-up selfies is on the rise; each of them more beautiful than the other—she's definitely moving in the right direction.

Gear up for the next big event coming your way 
Amidst alarming reports of air pollution, the continued celebrations of a certain celeb couple and Taimur Ali Khan's outings in Bandra, Nick Jonas, the collective brother-in-law of an entire nation, has made his entry into the country; the singer/songwriter and charmer of hearts was seen in New Delhi a few hours ago. Priyanka Chopra is currently in the capital too, shooting for upcoming feature The Sky Is Pink with Farhan Akhtar, hence it made perfect sense for the groom-to-be to land in the city. However, if Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's wedding is the template being followed here, the couple might just be inviting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to their celebrations. With Priyanka Chopra being a Padma Shri awardee and general national icon, the possibility of her inviting the head of the state is not completely out of bounds. 
Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's wedding is rumoured to take place at Jodhpur's Umaid Bhawan Palace between the last week of November and early December. The guesswork has begun, and Chopra is reportedly wearing Sabyasachi for the pheras. But this may not be the only ceremony the Quantico star has planned for her wedding celebrations. Given her shopping trips in New York City, there is reason to hope for a white wedding as well. And of course, what's a good Indian wedding without a sangeet and mehandi? 
Will we see the Jonas brothers perform to a Bollywood number? More importantly, will Priyanka Chopra live up to her fans' hopes and dreams and dance to ‘Desi Girl' and ‘Say Na Say Na'? We'll be keeping an eye out.

The bride and groom make a regal picture in their wedding finery 
Ever since Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh announced their wedding, fans have been keeping a close eye on their every move. Just a few days back, the duo took their relationship one step further by tying the knot at Lake Como, Italy in two different ceremonies—in the Konkani tradition and with an Anand Karaj wedding. After keeping everyone at the edge of their seats for the first look of their wedding pictures, it was just yesterday when Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh broke the internet by posting some stunning images from both the wedding ceremonies and the mehendi celebrations. 
And finally, the newly-wed couple who left for Bengaluru yesterday, is ready to kick-start the India leg of their wedding festivities, by hosting a lavish wedding reception for their family and close friends at The Leela Palace in the bride's hometown. While Deepika Padukone opted for a gold brocade sari in a look styled by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Ranveer Singh complemented her in an embroidered black and gold Rohit Bal sherwani. The couple shared a regal image of them in their wedding finery just before the reception kicked off. 
After being seen in a handful of beautiful Sabyasachi ensembles at her wedding, Deepika Padukone continued to favour a traditional Indian look at her Bengaluru wedding reception. This time around, the actor made a stunning bride in a gold brocade sari worn over a full-sleeved ivory blouse. Just like her wedding sari seen at Lake Como, this gold drape was also a gift from mother Ujjala Padukone, bought from Angadi Galleria in Bengaluru. While the outfit itself didn't feature any embellishment, Padukone amped up her post-wedding look with regal emerald jewellery (check out that gorgeous choker!). As for her beauty look for the evening, the new bride opted for a slick bun that highlighted her sindoor, and topped up her bun with fresh mogra. Complementing her, groom Ranveer Singh went with a heavily-embroidered black and gold Rohit Bal sherwani featuring Kashmiri embroidery. As seen in the pictures, the lobby of the hotel is beautifully decorated with red roses. 
Take a closer look at Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's ensembles from their Bengaluru wedding reception below:

Without a doubt the actor has been serving outstanding ethnic looks at all her wedding functions. For her reception party, last night Padukone picked a metallic gold brocade sari.  Similar to the kanjeevaram drape that she wore for her Konkani wedding ceremony, this gold sari was also a gift from mother Ujjala Padukone, bought from Angadi Galleria in Bengaluru. The actor accessorised her ensemble with regal emerald earrings, an emerald choker and a pearl necklace. Brides-to-be, if you are on the hunt for that perfect sari take inspiration from Deepika Padukone and invest in a gold number. 
The Padmaavat actor who is often seen favouring high neck blouses paired her luxurious traditional sari with a full-sleeved ivory blouse that perfectly balanced her high-shine brocade number. Beauty wise, the actor took her look up a notch via red lips, shimmery eyes and a pop of highlighter. Deepika Padukone maintained her middle parted slick bun combination that highlighted her sindoor and topped up her bun with fresh mogra. If you don't want to with a risqué blouse, you can take styling tips from Padukone and pick an ivory number.

See what Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Shilpa Shetty Kundra and others were up to 
When it comes to birthday parties in Mumbai, few can top the celebrations that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan throw for their daughter Aaradhya Bachchan. Each year, the little girl's big day is brought in with an intimate dinner, which is followed by a grand party held in the Bachchans' much-talked-about Mumbai mansion, Jalsa. This time around, Aaradhya celebrated her 7th birthday on November 16, 2018, with a unicorn-themed get-together that's bound to give kids all over the country some major birthday inspiration. Get all the unmissable details below. 
If you follow the Bachchans on social media, you may remember that when Aaradhya Bachchan turned six last year, the star family's home was transformed into a land full of princesses. How do you top that? For their daughter's seventh birthday, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan went with a unicorn theme, filling their front yard with large cut-outs of the magical animals along with rainbows and oversized blooms. Aaradhya celebrated her milestone moment with a three-tiered rainbow cake topped off with seven little fondant unicorns. Mom Aishwarya Rai Bachchan shared an inside picture of the family, saying “Love you eternally Aaradhya, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 7”. 
No birthday celebration is complete without one's favourite people, and for Aaradhya Bachchan's party, all her friends made sure to drop by. Spotted celebrating with the birthday girl this weekend were kids including Shah Rukh Khan's son AbRam Khan, Shilpa Shetty Kundra's son Viaan Raj Kundra, and Natasha Poonawalla's kids Cyrus and Darius Poonawalla. Joining them were the birthday girl's aunt Shweta Bachchan Nanda, along with Naina Bachchan, Esha Deol, Farah Khan Kunder, Goldie Behl and Tara Sharma. Some of the sweetest moments from inside the party include a video clip of dad Abhishek Bachchan helping his little guests learn the birdie dance, and an adorable snapshot of AbRam Khan saying hello to Amitabh Bachchan, who he thinks of as his own grandfather. 
Just like last year, Aaradhya Bachchan went all-out with her birthday outfit for her party. The seven-year-old was spotted having a great time with her friends in an ivory gown. The one-shoulder number was embellished with baby blue, yellow and soft pink sequins, and also featured little 3D flowers along the shoulders. Aaradhya Bachchan accessorised her peplum dress with a matching hairband. For her birthday dinner the previous night, she went with a little yellow number accessorised with an Alice band. 
Missed all the excitement from this Bachchan party? Time to catch up.

Looks like wedding season has truly arrived 
Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal join the ranks of high profile couples whose wedding celebrations are underway, as the Ambanis kicked off the festivities with a traditional dandiya raas event. Last night, Ambani's stylist, Ami Patel, shared a picture of the stunning bride-to-be right before the event, wearing a multi-hued Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla couture lehenga with intricate mirror and thread work. 
An evening of dandiya raas is customary in most Gujarati weddings, to start off the celebrations. The night calls for dancing, and Isha Ambani's look was kept easy and fuss-free for ease of moment. 
Mother of the bride Nita Ambani was also seen in an equally vibrant ensemble by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla couture, featuring mirror work and a lattice of floral embroidery. Mickey Contractor, Nita Ambani's go-to for makeup, shared a picture of her looking radiant before the night began. 
September 2018 saw Isha Ambani get engaged to Anand Piramal at Lake Como in Italy, and while the celebration was a grand affair, all designed and conceptualised by Dolce & Gabbana (who also designed their wedding invitation)—with award-winning singer-songwriter John Legend performing on stage—the wedding is expected to be even bigger and better. 
The couple's pre-wedding celebrations are set to take place in Udaipur on December 8 and 9 (with a rumoured performance by Beyoncé), and the wedding itself is slated for December 12 in Mumbai, at the family's home, Antilia. 
Stay tuned to this space for more details.

Unlike other stars who let the social media floodgates open once the ceremony was over, the duo continued to maintain privacy and did not share more than a handful of images from the beautiful ceremony. Naturally, all bets were off once they landed on Indian soil. 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh finally posed for the paparazzi at Mumbai airport upon their return from Italy. The couple, who has rarely spoken about their relationship in public, were the picture of happily ever after as they greeted eager fans and media. 
Continuing their Sabyasachi streak and twinning yet again, the couple wore beige silk coordinates (a salwar suit for Padukone and kurta pyjama set for Singh). Deepika accessorised hers with a bright red Benarasi dupatta, gold jhumkas, a traditional chooda and leather brogues. The actor wore her hair in a sleek bun and visible through the centre parting was a vermillion streak of sindoor that's worn by newly-married women in most parts of the country. Ranveer Singh wore a bright pink bandi jacket featuring elephant motifs over his kurta, along with dark brogues. Smiling through the chaotic welcome, the couple finally arrived at Singh's home for the grihapravesh ceremony for the new bride. 
According to reports, the couple will be hosting a series of events for the film fraternity, friends and extended family in both their home cities, Mumbai and Bengaluru. Stay tuned for more, but until then, scroll through pictures of Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's arrival in Mumbai after their wedding.

In an exclusive interview, celebrity hair pro and hairstylist for Deepika Padukone’s Lake Como wedding, Gabriel Georgiou gives us a behind-the-scenes peek at the wedding festivities—and of course, the bride’s look 
If you've been scrolling the Internet since last evening, you've probably spotted Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding photos on nine out of ten pages. Last month, the couple finally made their relationship official by releasing pictures of their wedding invite on their Instagram accounts, ahead of the wedding in Lake Como which took place this past week. The couple were married in a traditional Konkani ceremony on November 14 and a Sindhi Anand Karaj ceremony on November 15. 
Both the actors were dressed in head-to-toe Sabyasachi, and for her makeup, Deepika Padukone opted for neutral tones of blacks and browns for both the events for her makeup, with updos for her hair. Celebrity hairstylist and a frequent among the bride's regular entourage, Gabriel Georgiou was responsible for the actor's hairstyling for all the ceremonies in Italy. He spoke to Vogue India exclusively about her wedding hairstyles and what she was like as a bride. You read it here first. 
“The looks were very royal and beautiful. Two different vibes, one South, one North. The hair was very simple, because everything was so heavy, the jewellery and the dupatta and stuff. Just a middle parting, slicked back for both looks. For the South [vibe], it was a very tight bun with three rows of gajras at the back and a beautiful jewel in the middle of the bun. There was the maatha patti on the head, and then on top of that was the dupatta. The hair had to be strict, simple and strong enough to hold all that stuff. The bride needs to feel very secure and comfortable—[so that even if] she looks down, or she does this or she does that, nothing comes off. The second look was the same middle part, slicked, but for the North Indian [style] we did a braid at the back and then twisted it up in a bun. We had two rows of gajra this time with the earrings hinged into the braided bun at the back. And then you had the maatha patti on top, and the dupatta at the back.” 
“The thing with bridal hairstyles is, I don't believe in adding more textures, I didn't want it to look bridal-ly. You need to have a strong hairstyle that's going to last and hold everything together. A simple slick looks so chic and beautiful, and you don't need much more. We had planned all the looks in advance, so we all had an idea about what look we were doing with each outfit. Even though the hair was simple, it was so powerful. She looked beyond royalty, unbelievable. She loved that she felt amazing, and everyone was just blown away. Her look and the whole experience was very magical and peaceful. It was wonderful.” 
“She was very smiley, very happy. We had a lot of fun. There wasn't any pressure or hurry, it was all very chill. The vibes were very positive, we had music going, everyone was very happy, dancing, we were doing her hair and makeup; it was a lot of fun. It was a really wonderful, fun experience, and she was glowing! There was no drama, no stress, no nothing, everybody was on time and had their time to do things to perfection, it was really magical.”

Global luxury group Kering’s biggest brands are backing the foundation’s 2018 White Ribbon for Women campaign, #IDontSpeakHater, which takes a firm stance against cyberbullying and inspires Generation Z to take positive action 
Saint Laurent, Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen are among the brands taking a stand against cyberbullying this month as part of the Kering Foundation's White Ribbon for Women campaign. 
This is the first time in its 10-year history that the international luxury group's brands will be involved in fundraising efforts, donating 10 per cent of the retail price of selected products and lines across 1,300 stores from 16th to 30th November. Philanthropic purchases include Balenciaga's Puppy and Kitten bag, Bottega Veneta's Ellittica tote, Saint Laurent's logo hoodie and T-shirts and Gucci's cat-eye sunglasses and shoulder bags, among others from the likes of Brioni, Boucheron, Pomellato, DoDo and Alexander McQueen. 
As is now tradition, the Kering Foundation has also designed a campaign to coincide with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25. This year they are targeting Gen Z, calling on them to “break the chain” of abusive comments made online and highlighting the very real effects of hate speech, including stress, trauma, anxiety and depression. 
Research conducted by the United Nations Broadband Commission found that women are 27 times more likely to be bullied online than men. 
“Everyone has the right to feel safe online,” says Kering CEO and and chairman, François-Henri Pinault. He and the foundation he started in 2008 believe that bystander intervention is essential in tackling the global pandemic of cyber violence, which includes hate speech, hacking, identity theft, stalking and threats. “Ignoring abuse allows perpetrators to continue in impunity and contributes to the mainstreaming of violence against women and girls,” reads the campaign manifesto. 
“Kering once again demonstrates outstanding leadership by taking the lead with its campaign against cyberbullying, ” says Jonathan Newhouse, chairman and chief executive of Condé Nast International. “The effort to stamp out violence in all forms is more urgent and relevant than ever.” 
Born from 1995 onwards, Generation Z has truly grown up in the age of the “social internet”, and though many social media networks have taken action to facilitate the reporting of hate speech, there is still so much work to do. 
With #IDontSpeakHater and IDontSpeakHater.org, the foundation calls on everyone to speak out against abusive comments, countering insults and hate speech with wit and humour. The campaign will include a series of videos, featuring a team of international influencers including Edward Sad and Slim. Set against a neutral backdrop, they will react to real examples of cyberbullying, neutralising the abuse with positive, empowering responses in a rap battle-style.

Say hello to the newest married couple on the block 
Even though Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding was talked about for months—with rumours doing the rounds about everything from the location to the guest list and their wedding outfits—the three layers of security at the events made sure we didn't get a single actual look at the couple till they wanted us to. The newly-weds released the official images of both their wedding ceremonies in Lake Como—the Konkani one on November 14 and Sindhi one on November 15—on their Twitter and Instagram accounts a little after 8pm last night, which, as expected, went viral immediately after. A host of Bollywood celebrities took to their own Twitter accounts to congratulate Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh on their nuptials as well, both before and after the release of the pictures. Scroll onwards to have a look at what everyone had to say. 
A few A-listers also reposted the newly-wed couple's photos on their own Instagram feeds and Stories to wish them. Alia Bhatt said, “Congratulations you stunners ❤ ❤ ❤”, while Varun Dhawan congratulated them with a fluttering heart Giphy in an Instagram Story. Malaika Arora, too, posted the picture from Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's Anand Karaj ceremony with the same.

Unperturbed by self-doubt, societal norms and ‘filters’, these ladies are making a strong case for loving themselves the way they are. This is their story of freedom, strength and beauty 
I always looked forward to History class in school. I loved delving deep into the past, visualising, daydreaming and mentally teleporting to times gone by. But what I, and probably most of my classmates, waited for in eager anticipation, were those unplanned mental exercises and group discussions that our History teacher would have with us. One particular discussion that hasn't left me till date was when she asked us, “If you had to change one thing about yourself, what would it be?” Hands shot up—some instantly, some hesitantly—everyone taking inward cognisance of their own self-worth. “I wish I didn't have this massive mark on my thigh since birth.” “I wish my nose was thinner.” “I wish…” 
Now, while the times have changed today, self-acceptance is still a phenomenon that many struggle with. We may not be able to prevent ‘why me' moments from being a recurring theme in our lives, but if we learn to embrace our imperfections and accept every inch of our being—skin and bone—we'll have more to celebrate, and less to complain about. 
We spoke to five women who are rewriting the definition of beauty with their scars, curves and spots. If beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, they're teaching you to free yourself of judgement when you look in the mirror. And they're your reminder to accept and embrace what you have, instead of cooping up under the veil of self-pity. 
Plane crash and burns survivor, Pilates rehabilitation specialist 
I was 10 years old when on February 14, 1990, I lost my mum, dad and brother in a plane crash in India, and sustained 45 per cent burns to my face and body. I was flown back to the UK where I reside, to a burns unit where I met with my family. Six weeks after my accident, the nurse was due to remove the bandages from my eyes. There was a huge emphasis on the fact that I ‘look different'. I didn't quite know what that meant. What could be so hard about seeing myself? When the nurse held the mirror and I looked at myself, I thought it was a sick joke. It's in that moment I realised something big had happened. I struggled with my confidence as I deemed myself ugly and worthless because of my scars. 
July 10, 2013 is the day I found unconditional love for myself, during a reiki session. It was a pivotal moment in my life because suddenly I wasn't fighting myself. I made peace with the loss of my family and accepted how I look. I recall accepting my crooked smile as my own, and that I was never born to blend in but to stand out. I have had many days of feeling unworthy or not good enough. They have weighed me down and I never saw a way out. I meditate and practice self-love daily. I don't ignore or react to negative thoughts, but I allow them to ride and pass. We have the power of the mind and the ability to change a negative situation into a positive. Fundamentally, we need to practise being kind to ourselves. Do not fear what others think, and focus on what feels right for you. Be proud to stand out in a crowd and never lose focus of what is important for you. We all have the strength to overcome adversity, but it's our mindset that determines whether we choose to be a victim or a survivor. 
Entrepreneur, fitness model 
When I was 11 years, I developed my first patch behind my neck. It was after I left university that I had a burst of vitiligo and it spread fast everywhere. For 14 years, I fought the condition, trying different treatments to fix myself when I wasn't broken. I've always been a perfectionist and this was one thing I couldn't control. I felt like I had failed. There were times I didn't want to exist. But after I started travelling, I realised no one cared about the vitiligo. They saw me for the person that I am. So who was I hurting myself for? We only have one life, so why live it for others and [keep] thinking [about] what they'd want? Vitiligo has taught me to love myself as a person, to be strong. Learn to let go and accept that some things are just meant to be and happen for a reason. I've built myself to such a position in life where I'm financially, mentally, emotionally and physically stronger to be a voice for women. If I can do it, so can you. We all have that inner strength. 
Fire survivor, part time model, art gallery intern 
I was in a house fire when I was 17 years old, where my shirt had caught on fire—which has left me with scarring and disfigurement. My scars continue to change slightly with further surgeries, and there's something quite interesting about them being permanent but also impermanent in the way they shrink and grow. The idea that skin has to be perfect is redundant; everyone gets bruises, skin changes and develops over time. My scars will continue to change as I get older, but they're a permanent part of me that I am confident with. Perhaps with modelling, I have grown more confident about my appearance and body. It has now been just over three years since my accident. I have gone from not being able to lift my arm above 90 degrees to swimming and dancing with my arms lifted high. I have never felt more beautiful than I do now, in my body that has been through so many changes. My body is beautiful because it has learnt to move again. After being restricted movement-wise post my accident, I feel freedom in the knowledge that my body has overcome the trauma of my accident and has learnt to move again. 
Plus size model, founder, The Plum Tree Clothing 
For as many years as I can remember, I felt held back not by my weight, but by the judgment of people. I faced both passive and direct ridicule of my body when I was in school, in college and even when I started working. “Fat cow”, “moti”, “aaloo” are some of the ‘kinder' words used by some to define me. A few years ago, I was out for a social dance night with two of my girlfriends. It was salsa night (and I am a trained salsa dancer). I dressed up in my best, looked pretty and was all set for a night of fun and dancing. We walked into this club playing Latino music, [with] girls and boys dancing, and we made our way to a corner. Both my friends were invited to dance within 10 minutes of entering the place, while I waited the whole evening for someone to come and ask me. Then I quietly left the party. This incident broke my heart. I was judged for being a big size. Some assumed that I am fat and couldn't dance and some didn't want to be seen dancing with a girl like me. I was low for many weeks thereafter, but then I decided to not let this and many other incidents like these affect me anymore. I decided then to live life on my own terms, if nobody asked me to dance then I would rule the dance floor on my own. The day I brought this change in me, I realised the world also started looking at me differently. I started loving myself and giving myself the respect that I expected from others. Now, I am the first person to hit the dance floor and the last to leave. 
Acid attack survivor and activist 
[#image: /photos/5ce429e1cc50be5ff013f2a6]||| |||  
I was 15, in 2005, when this 32-year-old man proposed to me for marriage. Upon my rejection, he, along with his brother's girlfriend, stopped me outside the bus stand I would go to daily at Khan Market. The girl pushed me, and threw the acid she was holding on my face. I don't even remember when I fell unconscious, but when I regained my senses, I felt like I was burning alive, and I was still on the road, screaming for help. 
My skin was melting. When my dad reached the hospital and hugged me, his shirt burned from the effect of the acid on my skin. I've had multiple operations, which include sewing my eyes while I was conscious, I've remained in a hospital for 2 and a half months, and when I finally looked at myself in the mirror, I couldn't believe this had happened to me. Committing suicide felt better than living with that face. But then I told myself, my first mistake was not telling my parents before the attack about the man who did this to me, and I will make my second one now if I kill myself and leave them with too many questions unanswered. I decided to speak to them instead. My dad told me that one day, I will come to love this face of mine. He wasn't wrong. 
In 2006 we put a case in the court to ban acid. Meanwhile, I took admission in the 10th standard. In 2009 I took a challenge upon myself to make something out of my life. I took courses in beauty, tailoring, computers, and began living my life again. I decided to uncover my face. I heard nasty comments—and what hurt me more was that they came from girls more than boys. But instead of self-pity, I stood up for myself. I told them off. It was a struggle to even get a job, because of my face. I faced many rejections until finally, in 2013, I joined a campaign and started an organisation, where we rehabilitated more than 300 girls. We started India's first cafe run by acid attack victims. We decided that if no one is giving us a job, we will make them for ourselves. Giving money and helping the organisation is one thing, but I believe that being our friend is more important. Being ‘normal' with us is important. During this time, is also when the Supreme Court passed the order on acid ban—that it will not be sold openly or without an ID proof. Every story has its pros and cons. We usually tend to separate ourselves from it, but I am a part of the society that dissed me. If today I have come out and stood up for myself, I believe I have proven myself and I am willing to be open about it and speak. I want girls that have faced a situation like mine to know that they can speak to. I want to tell them that they have the right to feel beautiful in spite of what society thinks of them. I want their parents to know that it is important to rethink views, push your kids to move forward and support them. That they are normal, and not alone.

The first day of Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s celebrations kicked off with some fun tunes 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding celebrations in Lake Como are finally underway, but not without leaving their fans with incredible FOMO. The couple has decided on an intimate guest list for the Italian leg of the nearly month-long wedding, and have enforced a strict no-social media policy at the events. And even though barely any images have come out of day one, it looks like the mehandi-slash-sangeet ceremony that took place yesterday was a blast for those who attended. 
Websites that have been reporting diligently on the wedding reveal that the afternoon mehandi ceremony featured singer Harshdeep Kaur, who was also seen performing at Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement ceremony earlier this year. The songstress is said to have belted out many Punjabi hits, including ‘Kala Sha Kala', ‘Gur Nalon Ishq Mitha' and ‘Mehendi Hai Rachne Wali'. The entertainment also featured traditional dhols, which had the guests—and the bride and groom—dancing to popular wedding beats. 
Also Read: Here's what Deepika Padukone will probably wear at her wedding 
But the highlight, it seems, was when Ranveer Singh, performer that he is, took the mic to sing his hit number, ‘Tune Maari Entriyaan' from Gunday. At one point, the actor is said to have taken over the dhol himself, playing to Deepika Padukone and other guests. The couple later danced to old Bollywood hits played by the DJ. 
A guest was quoted on a Bollywood website revealing some of the details of the event. “Ranveer was in his element completely. His happiness was evident and he made sure that it is one of the most unforgettable events of his life… He was so excited that at one point he also took the dhol away and started playing himself and making the audience dance. Then he walked up to his lady love and played the dhol for her as she blushed. Then, the duo was seen shaking a leg together while the DJ played some dhamakedaar music—which were a mix of retro and new songs.” 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh are set to tie the knot in two different ceremonies; in a Konkani-style ritual today, and with an Anand Karaj tomorrow. Stay tuned for more details.

The couple has chosen a thoughtful way to commemorate their wedding 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding preparations are in full swing, as they are set to get married in Lake Como, Italy this week on November 14 and 15. The wedding has a strict no-phone policy, and a lot of the details are being kept under wraps, but we've learnt that the couple are eschewing the tradition of receiving wedding gifts at their reception. Instead, they have requested that all their guests donate to The Live Laugh Love Foundation, which was founded by Padukone to reduce the stigma around mental health, and spread awareness around the issue. 
Also read: What will Deepika Padukone wear on her wedding day? 
The actor, who has battled depression herself, started the foundation in 2015 with her counsellor Anna Chandy and psychiatrist Dr Shyam Bhat. Along with serving up a plethora of awareness programmes that have already been launched in schools and workplaces, the organisation also has a website featuring important mental health information. The foundation is helmed by Padukone's younger sister, Anisha, who is the director. In an earlier interview with Vogue India, the actor had spoken about her experience with depression. “When I got better, the first thing I wanted to do was to be able to just breathe. To take that weight off my shoulders, to be able to tell the world, Listen, this is the experience I've been through, this is what it felt like, and this is what it's called. And there are ways of dealing with it,” she'd said. 
This is just one of the ways that the Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh are making their wedding truly personal to them. A few weeks ago, the Bollywood power couple confirmed their wedding by releasing a joint statement on Instagram. The duo has since left for Italy, where they will get married at Lake Como (at Villa Del Balbianello) with two ceremonies that will honour each of their faiths. News on the grapevine states that Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh will have a Bengaluru and Mumbai reception soon after, too.

After months of rumours and denying rumours, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding is finally here. The couple flew off to Lake Como, Italy, where the wedding is taking place in a luxurious water-side villa named Villa del Balbianello. 
While the details of the highly private ceremonies might still be unknown to the general public, what anyone can safely place their bets on is Deepika Padukone's wedding wardrobe. A Sabyasachi fan by any standard, Padukone is bound to be dressed by the designer for her big day. The Padmaavat star is partial his work and has championed his designs on several occasions, including her first puja ceremony for the wedding. From saris to shararas, Padukone in Sabyasachi Couture has always been a winning combination. 
But when you have been something akin to a muse to the designer, and have been dressed in extravagant costumes already due to the nature of your profession, how can you possibly top it off any further? Despite what the world expects from Padukone, the only person she should listen to is, well, herself. Her personal style might be less ostentatious than that of her on-screen avatars (though Rani Padmavati and Mastani have probably inspired many a wedding trousseaus), but we can expect nothing less than a stunning ensemble on her big day. 
Possibly because of all the times that she has been spotted in saris over the years, chances are that Padukone will choose a lehenga for one of her two wedding ceremonies. According to the most recent word on the grapevine, she is set to wear a red lehenga choli for the Anand Karaj wedding ceremony, while Ranveer Singh will sport a Kanjivaram sherwani for one of the rituals. 
As for the events surrounding the big day, one can look forward to Padukone choosing some of the more playful, colour-heavy looks from the designer's collection. Perhaps she will pick a Kanjeevaram sari for one of them, to give a nod to her South Indian roots. 
Sabyasachi Couture goes best with the designer's heritage jewellery line. Expect to see exquisite handcrafted pieces featuring uncut diamonds, emeralds that will make you green with envy (so to speak), and definitely some with rubies. From what we've seen with her Bollywood peers' weddings, Deepika Padukone's bridal look too will be one that will be referenced by an entire generation of brides to come. And while one can only guess what she might pick from Sabyasachi's latest collections, there is every possibility that she might show up in a completely custom-created wardrobe that you've never seen before. Scroll through our gallery to see the looks and jewellery from the designer we hope to see Deepika Padukone wearing on her wedding day.

Mother Mira revealed his picture on Instagram for the first time 
Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor were blessed with a baby boy on September 5, but the couple had preferred to keep their newborn away from the paparazzi and their own social media feeds up until now. Over the weekend, Rajput Kapoor finally shared a picture of her son, Zain Kapoor, on her Instagram account with the caption, “Hello World 🌼.” Considering that the couple often shares adorable pictures of their older daughter Misha Kapoor, we're sure to see more of the newborn in the months to come. In a previous interview, Shahid has spoken about how his wife would like to have two kids early on in their marriage and then figure out life for herself. 
Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor announced their second pregnancy back in April with the sweetest post. The actor shared a snapshot of little Misha Kapoor lying on the ground smiling, with a chalk doodle spelling out “Big Sister” beside her. “This time it's been so interesting to see how Misha has been through the entire process,” Mira told Vogue in an earlier interview. “She knows there is a baby inside and she says, ‘Hi Baby!' every day to my tummy.” She also spoke about how supportive the actor has been throughout the pregnancy. “Shahid is an extremely loving and supportive husband. It comes naturally to him. The smallest things he does make me smile and feel so loved, like when I wake him up in the middle of the night with a foot cramp and he soothes it. Or how hands on he is with Misha and has really made sure she doesn't feel the lack of my attention and presence, especially in these last few weeks where I can't pick her up or play very much with her. It's everything put together. I couldn't have asked for a better partner to walk beside me through this journey.”

A look at their most adorable moments together 
For a relationship that's almost half a decade old, you'd think that we'd be used to seeing frequent co-stars and lovebirds Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh lavish each other with attention. Or so you'd think. The public interest in their relationship has grown in direct proportion to the fierceness with which the couple tried to keep things private when they first started out. 
As the Bajirao Mastani couple starts checking off couple-y milestones, as witnessed at the Ganpati celebrations held at the Ambani residence last week, here's a roadmap to all the major moments in their relationship. 
Singh first met Padukone, wearing a stunning silver gown, at the Zee Cine Awards in Macau, back in 2012. When quizzed by a fan about how he remembered what she was wearing, he replied, “How can one possibly forget the sight?” 
@pp_punjabi @deepikapadukone how can one possibly forget that sight!? #dropdeadgorgeous #5YearsOfRanveerSingh 
— Ranveer Singh (@RanveerOfficial) December 10, 2015 
Padukone got to know Singh better on the sets of Goliyon ki Rasleela… Ramleela (2013), and sparks flew. The budding romance was kept under wraps at the time, but Singh couldn't resist spilling the beans recently, on the movie's fourth anniversary. “Don't we look great together?” he raved in an Instagram throwback to the making of the period drama.

The occupational hazard of being in-demand actors is having to be away from home for long months during shoots. Singh bridged the distance on several occasions, visiting Padukone on the sets of her movies. Did you catch his small cameo in Finding Fanny (2014)? Check out the outtakes from the scene here. 
Amidst staunch denials from both sides, the two lovebirds took to the stage for the very first time at the Zee Cine Awards 2014 with an electrifying medley of their greatest hits. Look at those happy-in-love faces and tell us, how do you expect us to believe otherwise? 
He may be many things, but we're afraid that subtlety isn't one of Singh's strong suits. After entering filmmaker Farah Khan's bash separately in January, 2015, Padukone chose to leave on Karan Johar's arm… with a lovelorn Singh chasing her with a rose in his hand. 
The IIFA Awards held in June 2015 saw more PDA innocently snuck in under our noses when Singh received Padukone onstage by going down on one knee and serenading her with the song, ‘Ram Chahe Leela'. Just in case all the blushing hadn't made it wasn't obvious already. 
In October 2015, Singh and Padukone brought their sizzling chemistry to our grand anniversary cover shoot. If the playful photoshoot left you feeling short of the breath, the duo packed in a double whammy by taking a tongue-in-cheek dig at their just-good-friends stance in one of the most viral Dubsmash videos of the year. All in a day's work.

When his movie role demanded that he chop off his moustache in December of 2015, Singh hit the first button on his speed dial and Padukone came over with a pair of scissors, a camera and the concept of a viral video in hand. 
While they continued to attend parties together, in the year's edition of the IIFA Awards Padukone and Singh treated their fans to some more of their brand of romance. When Padukone wasn't making heart hands and mouthing “I love you” from the stage to an elated Singh, the latter found it humanly impossible to tear his gaze away from away at her press conferences. 
It's been a learning curve, but the couple finally went public with their relationship when Singh escorted a glowing Padukone out of the Ambani bash late last year, hand-in-hand. Inquisitive paparazzi, be damned. 
2017 was a landmark year for Padukone, as it marked her Hollywood debut with xXx: Return of Xander Cage opposite Vin Diesel. Not one to eat into his girl's share of the spotlight, Ranveer Singh played the dutiful boyfriend and provided moral support from the sidelines at the movie's Mumbai premiere. Can we all please take a minute to appreciate this gesture, coming from the master of excess? 
As the shoot of their upcoming movie, Padmaavat mandated more time spent in close quarters, the couple could be spotted around town, heading out for quick dinner dates, just like a normal couple. Except, dressed in Gucci, of course. More proof on how far the couple has come could be found in the Ganpati celebrations conducted at the Ambani residence last year. The pair arrived together in co-ordinated metallic ensembles, took photos and even dropped their guard in front of the media for some candid moments. 
With Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma eloping to the idyllic countryside of Tuscany, Italy for a hush-hush wedding, news started flying that the Padukone and Singh would soon follow suit. While the duo neither confirmed or denied the news, the speculation was helped along with their frequent PDA on Instagram—Singh took up a permanent spot in the comments section during her stint at Cannes earlier this year, wearing his heart on his sleeve with a string of relatable emojis. 
As the rumours continued to flow fast and loose, Padukone sportingly spilled the beans on the latest season of Koffee with Karan and admitted that she loves how expressive he is, even if she isn't the biggest fan of his dressing sense or sleeping pattern. After promising that they would be making an official announcement soon, the duo together solicited everyone's blessings for the wedding to be held on the 14th and 15th of the month. 
Slated to be held at a luxurious villa in Lake Como, Italy, the nuptials are spread out over multiple weeks, starting with a sangeet function on the 13th, followed by a Kannadiga wedding on the 14th, and a North Indian ceremony shortly after. The celebrations will finally wind up with a grand reception back on home ground on December 1st. The leggy actress has already got the ball rolling on the part of the blushing bride with a traditional puja last week, where she looked resplendent in a fiery orange ensemble by Sabyasachi, of course, who is rumoured to have designed the Italian leg of the wedding celebrations.

The couple paid a tribute to both their grandparents with thoughtful details incorporated in the invitation. Here’s a closer look 
As the wedding season arrives, the buzz for Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's wedding celebrations is gathering pace. The Ambanis are known for throwing the most memorable get-togethers, whether it is for festivities like Ganesh Chaturthi, or to commemorate their children's nuptials. September 2018 saw Isha Ambani get engaged to Anand Piramal at Lake Como in Italy, and while the celebration was a grand affair, all designed and conceptualised by Dolce & Gabbana—with award-winning singer-songwriter John Legend performing on stage—the wedding is expected to be even bigger and better. Most Indian festivities start with seeking the blessings of the elders in the family, and the couple has done this in the most poignant way with their detailed wedding invitation that is dedicated to both their grandparents. 
The floral-themed wedding invitation features a wreath of flowers, a chant, and the Om symbol around a monogram consisting of Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's initials. On opening, the card plays the Gayatri Mantra, and a note from the couple seeking the blessings of the goddess Gayatri Maa can be seen. The most emotional part of the invite comes next—a handwritten note written by the bride-to-be Isha on behalf of herself and her fiancée, where she pays an ode to their grandparents, who the two call their role models. While she talks about how both Piramal and her miss their grandfathers, who are unfortunately not with them anymore, they feel blessed to have their grandmothers with them. While deciding the symbols for the wedding, the note says, they decided to pick four special flowers that “personify qualities and values” that their grandmothers embody—the Lotus is dedicated to “Kokila Mummy”, the Hibiscus to “Purnima Nani”, the Rose to “Lalita Dadi” and Frangipani to “Arunika Nani”. 
Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's pre-wedding celebrations are set to take place in Udaipur on December 8 and 9 (with a rumoured performance by Beyoncé), and the wedding itself is slated for December 12 in Mumbai, at the family's home, Antilia. Check out the video above for a closer look at the wedding invite, and stay tuned to this space for all the updates.

All the love, light and happiness 
Given that our favourite celeb crew loves to party, it should come as little surprise that the past week has played host to a series of grand Diwali shindigs, from Shah Rukh Khan's big blowout at Mannat to Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla's house party. And after all the party-hopping, it was time to go back to family, as A-listers took to Instagram to allow fans a peek into their homes on the auspicious eve of Diwali. 
Mindful of the new regulations on the use of firecrackers, Bollywood's best instead chose to spread the light and warmth in different ways. Alia Bhatt collaborated with a team of volunteers to feed over 500 dogs across seven cities, before winding up the night with Karan Johar and his fresh batch of ‘students': Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria, from the cast of Student of the Year 2. The proud daddy, himself, was spotted twinning with his toddler in coordinated Manish Malhotra kurtas. Elsewhere, celebrity It-couple Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma made for an elegant portrait in their traditional garb against the backdrop of their brightly-lit home in Mumbai. 
The glamorous Bachchan clan chose to keep their celebrations family-only, and stepped outside after the Lakshmi puja to introduce young Aaradhya to the joy of sparklers. The proud mamas of the Kapoor clan, Kareena and Karisma, dolled up with their kids, with Taimur sporting a regal black kurta for the occasion. Bride-to-be Priyanka Chopra also spent some time off with her family in Mumbai before her nuptials, while Lisa Haydon ushered in some festive cheer against the glittering Hong Kong skyline. Second time parents, Mira and Shahid Kapoor snuggled up to make for a cosy picture on Instagram, and she was later spotted bonding with her brother-in-law and Bollywood debutante, Ishaan Khatter.

Don’t miss out on all the action 
India's festive season is finally here, and everyone's spent the weekend busy with Diwali pujas and get-togethers with friends and family members. But if there's one set of people that is sure to have the most glamorous updates on social media this week, it's Bollywood. In the past three days alone, the stars have been spotted hopping from one celebration to another, decked out in standout Indian ethnic looks. The Diwali celebrations kicked off with designer duo Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla's house party, which was attended by close friends Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Sussanne Khan, Maheep Kapoor and Natasha Poonawalla, among several other stars. Given that she was attending a party hosted by the couturiers, Bollywood's newest Ananya Panday made sure to stop by dressed in glittering Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla lehenga too. Also on the guest list for the evening were Sidharth Malhotra, Arjun Kapoor, Malaika Arora and Shraddha Kapoor. 
As the weekend progressed, the parties just got grander. On Saturday night, Shah Rukh Khan and wife Gauri Khan's Mumbai home, Mannat, lit up with a thousand fairy lights for a grand Diwali get-together. One of the highlights of the evening has to be the stunning family portrait of the Khans that has taken over Instagram. But that's not where the festivities ended! Bringing the weekend full of celebrations to a close was Shilpa Shetty Kundra and husband Raj Kundra's at-home Diwali party on Sunday evening. While the host for the night smiled for cameras in an ivory Amit Aggarwal number, her guests opted for equally eye-catching looks for the evening. We spotted Jacqueline Fernandez walking in in an interesting black and white ensemble, Preity Zinta in a mint green anarkali and Pooja Hegde in an elegant lilac number.

It was a star-studded affair, quite literally 
Every time Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan throw a party, you can be sure it'll have the best of Bollywood in attendance. Saturday, November 3, saw the couple hosting a Diwali party at their residence in Bandra, Mannat, and of course, most of the film industry was there in their best traditional wear, celebrating the night away. Gauri Khan's decor team put together a beautiful setup of lights to replicate a starry night at their feet, which served as the photo spot for most of the guests. What followed was a series of Instagram posts by the stalwarts of tinsel town that were FOMO-inducing to say the least. 
Bollywood's girl gang of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Malaika Arora and Amrita Arora Ladakh all showed up in glittering festive outfits, and each of their social media posts is proof that they had a great night. Karan Johar and Alia Bhatt were also seen in attendance, along with members of the Khan-daan—Salman Khan, Arpita Khan and Aayush Sharma, Alvira Khan, Atul Agnihotri and Seema Khan. Katrina Kaif, one of Shah Rukh Khan's leading ladies for his upcoming release, Zero, channelled a belted sari in black at the glamorous night, while Shilpa Shetty Kundra was spotted sporting one in nude. We saw mom-and-daughter duo Jaya Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan Nanda at the party too, along with soon-to-be parents Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi. And amongst the slew of Bollywood debutantes, Sara Ali Khan and Student Of The Year 2's Ananya Pandey made an appearance as well. 
All the boys were present in their festive spirit—Ranbir Kapoor, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan partied the night away. Kajol, who also attended, shared an adorable picture with her long-time co-star and friend on her Instagram account. But the highlight of the night had to be the family picture the Khans took at their Diwali 2018 party, which saw a little AbRam posing with his parents and sister, Suhana Khan.

Have you met the #JSisters? 
Priyanka Chopra's wedding festivities have taken off. With less than a month to go for her big day, Chopra has already had a bridal shower at Tiffany's, and this weekend the star took off to Amsterdam with her closest girlfriends for a bachelorette party. Chopra has been sharing snapshots from the getaway and from what can be seen on social media, she is having a blast (as she should) by the canals of the picturesque city. 
Chopra, who has been favouring feather detailing of late, was seen two different looks with the embellishment during her Amsterdam trip. One was a sweater dress with plumes and thigh-high boots, for a canal tour with her girl gang that included Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner. For what one can assume was the games and going out part of the party, she wore an embellished minidress that came with a feathered cape. For another day out in the city, she picked a colour blocked sweater and a checkered skirt, which were styled with the all-important tulle crown and sash that spelled out ‘bride-to-be'. 
With future sister-in-law Sophie Turner by her side, the #JSisters have been on a roll. According to Chopra's Instagram stories, the parties are going on till the wee hours of the morning, and the Quantico star was seen carrying Turner piggyback style on her Instagram stories. You can tell, this is only the beginning of an epic relationship in the future. Other close friends of Chopra's were also seen in a picture posted by the actor before their canal ride. 
In case you missed all the inside action, here are all the pictures from Priyanka Chopra's bachelorette in Amsterdam.

For these women, hair is more than just vanity 
Hair is not always just hair. Entwined in the concepts of beauty and vanity are questions of meaning and identity. For three women, it's also an extension of their religious beliefs and cultural leanings. We celebrate the unique relationship a Muslim model has with her hijab and explore how a Rastafari identifies with her locs, while a Sikh woman reveals the conversations she's having around hair and outward beauty. 
Jessie Kaur Lehail cofounded the Kaur Project, a storytelling site about the varied experiences of modern Sikh women like her. She lives in Vancouver. Right now she cuts her hair but will stop if she decides to take the Amrit ceremony of initiation. 
South Asian women have a very interesting relationship with hair. Within our culture, it's the ultimate identifier of beauty. Globally, our hair is sought after for wigs. Extensions are usually made from Indian hair, that black, beautiful hair. I think my parents tried to instil in me that having long hair was beautiful. 
We're Sikh, and keeping your hair long is also part of five specific principles that are connected to the religion. It's very important for people who have undergone Amrit, which is a ceremony of initiation and marks a deeper commitment to Sikhism. When you are going through that process, you are asked to abide by these rules by not cutting your hair, not eating meat, not drinking, and being a good human. When someone is in need, it is your responsibility to help. In taking Amrit, you are taking an oath to align yourself with that way of life. You, essentially, become a role model for the religion. 
My parents, now that they have taken Amrit, don't cut their hair. But they haven't said, “You need to do this in your life.” Their mindset is: Live your life, and when you feel ready to take those steps and that responsibility, then you make that choice. They didn't take those steps until they were 50 years old. Only much later in life did they decide to embark on that journey together.

I was born and raised in a small town about three and a half hours from Vancouver. There was no acceptance of other ethnicities. When I was eight years old, girls tried to set alight my almost-waist-length hair. My cousin and I had come back from our gurudwara on a Sunday afternoon. She happened to be wearing her Indian outfit, a salwar kameez. We were playing on the school playground, next to my house. These girls came after us, running with lighters. We came home running, crying that these girls were trying to burn our hair. It was a way for them to scare us, control us, and it was overt racism. 
Hair, and outward beauty, is a constant conversation that Sikh women are having, just like all women are. Whether you have long hair or short hair, whether it's under a turban or a headscarf, a lot of women feel they're not good enough or that there's something wrong with them. There are some that are obviously joyful and happy with their choices, but so many are in that grey zone of not knowing where exactly they fit in. I want Sikh women to have a space to talk about whatever they want to talk about: hair, religion, all the other conversations. I want them to feel safe and secure. The word “Sikh” means student. I think I'm still a student. — As told to Allie Jones 
Kelissa McDonald is a 29-year-old singer-songwriter from St Andrew, Jamaica. She grew up with Rastafarian parents and decided to grow her hair in long locs when she was a child in accordance with Rastafarian tradition. 
I believe that Rastafari is a very personal journey. We definitely use the Bible as a reference on how to live and the things we believe and our history. But in many ways Rastafari is self-discovery through sacramental herbs, the books we read, the way that we deal with each other, even the way that we grow our locs. With Rasta, there's an idea of staying natural. We maintain an all-natural diet and try to keep the things that we put on our body, down to the shampoo that we use, as close to nature as possible. Part of that natural approach includes not cutting our hair. When Jamaican people, as well as people of African heritage, stop cutting our hair, it naturally forms locs. 
[#image: /photos/5ce424d41dc2674255c78196]||| ||| Photographed by Lauren Ward 
My parents never forced me or my siblings to grow locs; it was always our decision. I was probably the last one in my family to do it—I think I was about nine or 10 years old. At the time, as much as I was growing to understand the world around me, I still think that I didn't understand it fully. Growing locs, for me, was more about identifying with my family. I felt like that was really important. I remember at the time Rasta wasn't something that was very accepted in Jamaica. There are many boundaries and stereotypes that we had to face every day. We were almost seen as outcasts, and for me growing my locs was a way of identifying with my family and my beliefs. 
Anybody who grows locs and is somewhat aware will tell you that there is a whole other dimension to growing locs that's separate from just the physical representation of it. I believe that locs are an extension of our energy. As someone who has studied the chakra system a little bit, the spirit is very connected to what's happening in the physical [realm]. So for me, locs are almost an extension of my crown chakra energy. They act as antennas, you know? My hair helps me discern the intentions of people, actually. It might sound crazy, but it's something that I really do believe. I respect it because it has encouraged a level of awareness in me in many ways. 
I also feel a need to protect the energy, so sometimes I wrap my hair. Especially going into public spaces, I think that my locs make me more sensitive to energies, so sometimes when I know that I'm going to be around a lot of energy, around a lot of people, I'll wrap it just as a form of protection. — As told to Allie Jones

Earlier this year, the audience at the Molly Goddard show at London Fashion Week met with an unusual sight: a striking 5ft11in black model in a floaty dress, with a hijab covering her hair, commanding the runway. Ikram Abdi Omar is one of a very small number of models challenging the fashion industry's stereotypes and claiming representation for themselves as well as millions of girls who look like them. By Parizaad Khan Sethi 
[#image: /photos/5ce424d489be3655207cf749]||| ||| Courtesy Susanne Spiel; Jinam Kim 
Ikram Abdi Omar was born in Sweden, is of Somali origin and moved to the UK with her family when she was eight. Like many young girls her age, she grew up watching modelling shows on TV and idolising Naomi Campbell. “I've always been tall, like my mum and aunt. My aunt was a model. I always looked up to them and I thought, ‘It runs in the family, so why not model?'” However, international runways were not exactly populated by models who looked like her. 
Her school days were filled with creative arts like drama and dance, and she loved sports like basketball and football, travelling from city to city to play matches. She also had a nerdy streak and was the student that asked for extra homework. “I was really dedicated and loved maths and science growing up. I'd get extra maths worksheets and practise equations and stuff,” she says. So it wasn't a surprise when she opted to study biomedical science in college. The camera and runway were still very much a passion she didn't give up on, but there was a barrier for entry—her hijab. Omar had started wearing one when she was around 12. “I wanted people to see me as a Muslim, because it's part of me. The headscarf allows me to express that. I also feel powerful and beautiful when a lot of people around me wear it,” she says. 
[#image: /photos/5ce424d4b40d262505d6c13c]||| ||| Courtesy Susanne Spiel; Jinam Kim 
For centuries, women have consciously and unconsciously used their hair as a marker of identity that can be intensely personal but also cultural, geographical or religious. Omar's hijab holds similar importance. “It's been really significant to me because it stands for modesty and beauty. I feel closer to God when I wear it, and that hasn't really changed over the years because I still have the same beliefs and values.” 
She's honest about the fact that she wasn't always this confident. “I did feel the lack of representation when I was growing up and I was afraid to step into the [modelling] field. But as I matured, I thought my headscarf shouldn't limit me, and I just went right into it,” she says. 
Omar started doing free photoshoots for headscarf and abaya companies so she could build her portfolio. She would make the two-hour trip from Bristol, where she lived, to the fashion centre of London for photoshoots. She recalls fashion folk being quite shocked in the beginning and enquiring if her family was okay with her modelling. But Omar says they got used to the idea and now see the hijab as another fabric they can work with from a fashion perspective. 
She soon got signed to a modelling agency and her LFW debut came soon after. Goddard, who was later named the winner of the British Fashion Council/Vogue Fashion Fund for 2018, was hosting one of the hottest shows of the fashion calendar, and Omar couldn't have picked a buzzier setting as her runway debut. “It was quite exciting being one of the first models in a hijab,” says Omar, who's now been on magazine covers, in ads for high-street brands and has had her name featured on lists of cool young people who are disrupting their respective industries. 
As proud as she is of her success on a personal level, Omar also gets a sense of elation from knowing she's managed to represent a very marginalised group—hijab-wearing Muslim girls whose portrayals in the media have been severely one-dimensional. “In the creative arts you don't see a lot of headscarf-wearing women, but [seeing them] gives young girls hope to pursue anything they want to do in life,” she says. Omar is now often approached by kids who want her to keep going. “It feels amazing. I feel like I'm looking at a younger me. I tell them to make sure they stick to what they do, stay true to themselves, and never give up.” 
Omar's beauty routine has some turbo-charged home recipes 
Skin: “I have oily skin, so I wash my face often with an oil-free cleanser and really cold water. I exfoliate once a week with a lemon, sugar, turmeric, yoghurt and honey mask. It's a recipe from my mum and grandmother. For the body, I use a black sugar honey scrub.” 
Hair: “I apply castor oil to my roots to help my hair grow well and stay lush. It really strengthens my hair.” 
Exercise: “I work out at the gym often. I played basketball at university but I'm taking a break because of modelling, so I don't get to play that often. But I try and find the time to play with my siblings.”

For centuries, the Indian ideal of beauty has been a static, unchanging identity. A generation of women are agitating that homogenous idea of feminine beauty, one stunning face at a time. We’re putting a spotlight on the women who represent the breathtaking diversity of our nation 
Homogeneity has never been a way of life in India. Our existence and world view have been shaped by multiple religious, social, political and cultural influences that, for the most part, have co-existed symbiotically. However, the one aspect in which we've so far nurtured a blinkered point of view is when it comes to our norms of beauty. Female (and even male) beauty has been herded into a narrow alley with not much room to manoeuvre, despite the genetic diversity modern India has inherited. 
From a historical context, this makes perfect sense. India has seen huge influxes and movements of populations over centuries—invading forces left their own mark on art and culture and shaped world views according to their mores. Since beauty ideals are influenced by the more prestigious or dominant culture, it's no surprise that in ancient India, the fair skin of the Aryans, and later that of Europeans, was seen as superior, and has endured as the prototype we aspire to even in modern times. 
Even in today's more globalised world, we often look Westward to reinforce our definitions and ideals of beauty. The popularity of the Kardashian empire proves we're very susceptible to Western suggestions of what is beautiful. We end up reinforcing our belief of a Eurocentric ideal, and ironically, a centuries-old cycle keeps perpetuating itself. 
World over, the frame of reference for beauty is now widening to include a variety of women of colour. And we're seeing a corresponding movement in India, in the women we choose to represent us as our beauty icons. In recent times, model Radhika Nair, with her urbane, androgynous appeal, has been on the cover of British Vogue and our own September issue, and we can't get enough of Naga model Ketholeno Kense (a Vogue India Women Of The Year Young Achiever winner for 2017). In this story, Toshada Uma demonstrates that androgyny and a fluctuating hairline can be sexy, the Dweltz twins are proof that a few tweaks in DNA high up in the family tree can have surprising results generations later, and Sonali Singh isn't going to let something as trivial as a scar stop her. Meanwhile, Renee Kujur is the new poster-child for the diversity of the Indian gene pool, because she's a dead ringer for Barbadian superstar Rihanna. 
It's a generation of confident young Indian women who are sparking these conversations and helping our beauty ideals widen and evolve by agitating that unchanged idea of feminine beauty: fair skin, almond-shaped eyes, long, straight black hair and a curvaceous figure. They are replacing it with an individualistic aesthetic that celebrates their heritage, their unique features and flaws and, most of all, their vision of Indian-ness. 
A year ago, Sonali Singh had her life together. She wanted to be a model for ages even though her traditional family didn't support her dream. “No one ever told me I was beautiful. I was too short, too thin, too dusky. I just believed in myself.” It paid off—she got scouted in a mall, was signed to an agency, and things were looking up. Then came the crash. 
A car accident left her with a deep scar on her forehead, and for a while she thought her modelling dream was over. “I didn't think people would accept me with the scar,” she says. She concealed the scar with makeup as best as she could and started going to auditions. Trying out for TV commercials and brand shoots, she lost jobs that needed bland, conventional faces. But for some sections of the fashion industry, her scar gave her face character and set her apart. A successful Sabyasachi campaign later, Singh is adding acting and dancing skills to her portfolio with eyes on Bollywood. She's coming soon to a big screen near you. 
The Dweltz twins, with their natural red hair, fair skin and striking features, were used to playing games of genetic 20 Questions with most people they encountered: Had their hair been dyed? Were they adopted? Were their parents foreigners? No to all of those, for the record. The twins do have some European heritage high up in their family tree, but they're as Indian as they come. “Growing up in Indian society with different features has been a constant effort to blend in,” says Deveney. As children, their idea of beauty was shaped by what society considered attractive, and those freckles were not exactly their favourite feature. Today, their perceptions have evolved, and they've grown to accept and love themselves, freckles and all. “A beautiful face, skinny body and fair skin is not everything. Love yourself, accept your body and make yourself happy,” says Deveney. Few can fault this wisdom from a 19-year-old. 
Renee Kujur could chart her professional life on a timeline with two distinct periods: BR and AR. During BR, or Before Rihanna, Kujur was an aspiring model who started working after school to earn money for a portfolio. She did some shoots, but her dark skin didn't exactly endear her to colour-conscious photographers. When a friend noticed her resemblance to pop icon Rihanna, Kujur's luck began to change. That's when her After Rihanna phase started and she began booking jobs for her natural beauty. It's surprising Kujur's glowing skin, liquid eyes and full lips needed a superstar doppelgänger to gain approval, but the model is wholeheartedly embracing this opportunity to further her career. “I was made to feel that my colour and my features were my weakness but I made them my strength. Don't hate what [you're born with].” 
Toshada Uma grew up with a precocious streak: despite being teased for her petite size and crooked teeth, she anchored events and walked the ramp as a child artist. It was only when she started developing alopecia—a condition that creates bald spots on the head and body—that her confidence wavered a bit. Her 4ft8in frame holds a quiet self-assurance and she realised early on that she wasn't ugly, just different. “I've always considered myself beautiful,” she says. Uma first tried to grow out her hair to conceal the hairless patches, but later, in a gesture of acceptance, she made the decision to go bald. “I think short hair suits me better. I'm glad I don't feel pressured into growing it anymore.” 
The blogger and model is today a sensation for fans of alternative fashion—she's known for her experimental dressing and her fearless hair and makeup choices, especially her use of wigs. Uma is one of the forces taking the Indian fashion conversation beyond the mainstream.

The #DeepVeer wedding is finally here. Are you ready? 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding has been in the news for so long now that we could curate a book of all the rumours on the details of the nuptials—and it's already headed towards being a thick read. The much-coveted duo confirmed their wedding dates—November 14 and 15—with a invitation-style statement on Instagram a couple of weeks ago, just before Padukone appeared on the inaugural episode of Koffee With Karan's sixth season and talked about her beau. A newspaper also reported that the wedding will feature two ceremonies honouring each of their faiths, and will take place in Lake Como, Italy, along with a Bengaluru and Mumbai reception shortly after. Cut to today, and it looks like the celebrations have already begun. Scroll for all the details.  Also Read: What Will Deepika Padukone's Wedding Dress Be?  
The wedding festivities have begun today with a puja in what could be Deepika Padukone's Bengaluru home. How do we know? Padukone's crew, including stylist Shaleena Nathani, makeup artist Sandhya Shekar and hairstylist Gabriel Georgiou (who also did Anushka Sharma's hair at her wedding in Tuscany), all shared photos of the bride at the event on their respective Instagram accounts. We saw Padukone dressed in a radiant orange outfit by one of her favourite Indian designers, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with royal chandbalis accessorising her look. Her makeup and hair was kept minimal with a soft, low bun, accentuated eyes with a blurred liner and lashes, and a nude lipstick. If her first look is anything to go by, we're sure that Padukone is definitely going to make a stunning bride. Stay tuned to this space for all the updates. 
The puja was followed by a traditional Konkani lunch—her hairstylist Georgiou gives us a peek.

From that probably significant Met Gala night to wedding venue hunting and bridal parties, here’s a complete breakdown of the couple’s relationship 
The date is set, the venue (probably?) fixed, a bridal shower has been thrown—Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas's straight-out-of-the-movies romance has fast forwarded to the ‘I Do' moment. Chopra and Jonas are reportedly set to tie the knot on December 2 at the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur, before which they are said to be hosting traditional mehandi and sangeet functions starting from November 30. Two people from two ends of the world meet at a ball, have a Tiffany moment, and are now gearing up to get married against the backdrop of a palace? Here's a quick look back at how this real life fairy tale came to be. 
Chopra and Jonas were first seen together in public on the occasion of the Met Gala in 2017. The Quantico star arrived in a jaw-dropping, trailing trench dress with Jonas by her side, both dressed by Ralph Lauren, and seated at the same table. Of course, back then, no one saw this coming. Chopra herself denied any rumours about the two being together. When talk show host Jimmy Kimmel tried to probe the subject, she replied saying, “Yeah, we were on the same table and we already know each other. So he was like ‘Hey, you wanna go together? And I was like, ‘Yeah, OK, let's go together.' It ended up working out.” 
Chopra and Jonas tried to keep things casual in front of the public eye when they attended the Beauty And The Beast live concert together late in May this year. Soon after, the two were also spotted at Dodgers game in Los Angeles over the Memorial Day weekend. With little to no PDA to bank upon, fans were still unsure about where all these public outings were headed, but things became pretty apparent when the two started commenting on each other's social media posts. 
If you're serious about your partner, chances that you will introduce your SO to your family are pretty high. First, Priyanka Chopra went as Nick Jonas' date to his cousin's wedding in Atlantic City, New Jersey. A few weeks later, the couple was in India—Nick Jonas met with Priyanka Chopra's extended family, and the two were spotted enjoying the Mumbai monsoon on the terrace of Chopra's home in the city. The couple soon left for a trip to Goa, which included close friends of the actor, and cousin Parineeti Chopra. And that's not all, the duo made their first public appearance together as a couple at Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani's engagement party not that long after. 
After spending quality time in India, Chopra and Jonas returned to New York for the 4th of July celebrations with the Jonas'. This time, the couple hung out with Joe Jonas and his fiancé, actor Sophie Turner. And after much speculation among fans, and a Sweet Home Alabama moment featuring a Tiffany & Co store being closed down just for the two of them (so Chopra could pick out her engagement ring in privacy) Nick Jonas popped the big question on the actor's 36th birthday (July 18) in London. Reports revealed that sources close to Jonas said he's “very, very happy… His friends and family have never seen him like this, and they're all really excited for him. He's definitely very serious about her.” 
Back in Bollywood, that meant formalising the new relationship status with a roka ceremony exactly a month after. The Jonas family flew down for the intimate celebrations at Priyanka Chopra's home. But it wasn't just about parties with friends and family—the duo paid a visit to St Catherine's Home for Girls in Andheri, Mumbai, to share their love. 
Then there was the question of picking a nickname for the couple whose moves were being tracked by every tabloid. The singer-songwriter stopped by at The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon to promote his song “Right Now”, where he revealed the nickname that his fiancée liked. Fallon had all sorts of questions regarding their romance. Chopra, who was supporting her beau from the wings, spoke out when Fallon asked which couple nickname she liked. Turns out, Chopra's pick was ‘Pr-ick', which Jonas is still warming up to. 
Recently, the couple made a trip to scout their wedding venue in Jodhpur, and it looks like they've zeroed in on the picturesque Mehrangarh Fort for their nuptials. And soon after, pictures of a lavish bridal shower hosted by Tiffany & Co started taking over the internet as well . 
Not much is known about Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' actual ceremonies—whether they'll choose a white wedding, a traditional Hindu ceremony, or both—but here, we've tried to narrow down the pool of designers she's likely to choose from for her bridal ensembles. While you wait for more news, scroll below to get a glimpse of the couple's cutest moments till date.

Supermodel Karlie Kloss invites Vogue to Kode With Klossy Summer Camp, and answers 73 intriguing questions 
We checked in with Karlie Kloss for Vogue's latest episode of 73 Questions to find out what she's been up to lately. Her answer: “World domination.” (Joke.) What this supermodel has really been up to is coding. Or more specifically, running Kode With Klossy, a camp for girls interested in tech. Kloss introduces us to a few of her young scholars, busy on their laptops solving the problems of tomorrow, all while settling a few questions. She and Taylor Swift are definitely cool. She and venture capitalist Joshua Kushner got engaged this summer in upstate New York over “a romantic weekend, just the two of us.” And her friend and YouTuber extraordinaire Casey Neistat, who skates in for a cameo, will likely not get to bring all three kids to the Kloss-Kushner nuptials. (Though he is helping Kloss with her YouTube channel.) Ashley Graham, “my girl,” Kloss says, appears as well (via FaceTime) to find out what Kloss's cocktail of choice is. There's discussion of feminism, beauty secrets, workout routines (“cardio, abs, and booty”), and a few ballet moves. Where is Kloss in 10 years? Surrounded by loved ones. Still challenging herself... and driving a hard bargain with anyone who wants a piece of her tech empire.

We went behind-the-scenes with the acclaimed journalist at Vogue Women Of The Year 2018 
https://youtu.be/-7Te_E9KTTY 
The second annual Vogue Women Of The Year Awards saw many industry leaders and Bollywood celebrities being acknowledged for their achievements. Among other A-listers, award-winning journalist Faye D'Souza received another trophy to add to her shelf on the prestigious night as well. She was lauded with the Opinion Maker Of The Year award at this year's Vogue celebrations, for her undeniable role in fiercely championing causes relevant to the nation. 
She wore a blue embellished gown by Gaurav Gupta, and was quick to describe her outfit as “brave”, because it was unlike anything she usually wears. Her hair was styled sleek and straight, and her makeup included a bold navy smoky eye with a nude lip. 
D'Souza has been flexing her journalistic prowess on our screens as the anchor for The Urban Debate on Mirror Now, and has garnered support and acclaim for her no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners approach to issues like women's safety, equality and taxes. But, behind the scenes, her challenges are just like ours. She feels like she doesn't get enough sleep, and wants to dress as comfortably as she possibly can. 
D'Souza invited Vogue India to get a front row seat as she chatted, laughed and twirled her way onto the red carpet for her first Vogue Women Of The Year awards. In the video, she tells us why she looks up to Ellen DeGeneres, and how she thinks Vogue empowers women to make choices. Check it out now.

The tennis star delivered her first child early this morning 
The latest baby news to hit headlines: star tennis played Sania Mirza and Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik are now parents to a baby boy. Malik took to Twitter early this morning to update their fans, writing, “Excited to announce: Its a boy, and my girl is doing great and keeping strong as usual #Alhumdulilah. Thank you for the wishes and Duas, we are humbled 🙏🏼 #BabyMirzaMalik 👼🏼” The couple got married in April 2010 in Hyderabad, which, according to Google Trends, made Mirza the most-searched woman tennis player and Indian sportsperson that year. 
Director and close friend of Mirza's, Farah Khan Kunder also shared the news on her Instagram, as seen below. Her husband, Shirish Kunder and actor Raveena Tandon sent their best wishes on Twitter too. 
The couple first confirmed the pregnancy in April this year on Twitter with an adorable illustration. 
When questioned about the gender of the baby earlier this month, Mirza had said, “...obviously if it is only my child, I would hope, pray and wish for it to be a healthy child. It doesn't matter if it is a boy or a girl, which seems to be very important for a lot of people. Besides that, to believe in yourself and always know that you have the freedom to be whoever you are. At this point, with regard to my baby, all I truly hope, pray and wish is, for it to be healthy, regardless of the gender.” 
Congratulations to the happy couple!

The first look of the much-awaited Bollywood movie is out 
It's safe to say that Sara Ali Khan's debut has been one of the most awaited among the Bollywood's younger set. Between Abhishek Kapoor's Kedarnath and Rohit Shetty's Simmba, there has been a bit of back and forth on which of the two movies she'll be seen in first, given that she's been shooting for them consecutively. Now that Simmba, where she is starring opposite Ranveer Singh, is postponed, it looks like the stars have aligned to launch Khan with Kedarnath itself, where she will be seen with Sushant Singh Rajput. The 25-year-old shared the poster for the film on her personal Instagram this morning with a caption reading, “No tragedy, no wrath of nature, no act of God can defeat the power of love! Presenting the official #KedarnathPoster, teaser out at 12 noon!''—telling fans to stay on the lookout for updates. 
The poster sees Khan in an entirely traditional avatar, complete with a nose ring, riding on co-star Sushant Singh Rajput's back, who is holding a walking stick that instantly makes us think of rocky roads and hilly terrains, alluding to the film's title. Set to release of December 7, 2018, the film comes with the tag line ‘Love is a pilgrimage', and is reportedly a unique love story set against the backdrop of the 2013 Uttarakhand floods that left the state devastated. 
While we're sure December is going to be a great month for the young actor, with two new releases—Kedarnath opposite Sushant Singh Rajput and Simmba opposite Ranveer Singh—which one will make a statement at the box office is still anyone's bet. While we wait for more from Simmba, check out Kedarnath's teaser, below.

From Anushka Sharma to Shilpa Shetty Kundra, here’s what Bollywood celebrities did on Karva Chauth 
Every year, Bollywood comes together to celebrate Karva Chauth every year with much enthusiasm. This year was no different, as celebrities sliced out time from their jam-packed calendars to be with their loved ones on the occasion. While the Kapoor household celebrated with family and friends, the newlyweds Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli observed their first Karva Chauth, and Ayushmann Khurana chose to fast for his wife as she is recovering from a preventative mastectomy. 
At the Kohli-Sharma house, the couple who got married last December chose to fast together. While Anushka Sharma tweeted a selfie with Virat Kohli with the caption: “My moon, my sun, my star, my everything. Happy Karva Chauth to all”, Kohli addressed his wife as: “My life. My universe.” 
Like every year, everyone from Maheep Kapoor to Raveena Tandon and Neelam Kothari got together at Sunita and Anil Kapoor's home in Juhu for their annual Karva Chauth celebration. Maheep Kapoor shared a picture of the ladies and also added a special note on how they all missed Sridevi on the special day, when they would all be together each year. Shilpa Shetty Kundra, who missed the festivities this year, celebrated in Sri Lanka with her husband, Raj Kundra. 
While the other ladies of the Kapoor household kept their fasts, Sonam K Ahuja chose not to celebrate. The actor, who married entrepreneur Anand S Ahuja in May this year, revealed that Anand ‘bullied her' not to fast in an Instagram post. The picture was captioned, “I hope to live my best life with you always my love and to being the most progressive, compassionate and gentle man I know. Happy KC and thank you for bullying me into not keeping it in the most hilarious way possible.” Anand responded to the sweet message by saying, “I didn't bully you! I just said that I'm fasting if you're fasting, and if we don't fast we can just walk around and workout and enjoy the day together! Does that sound like bullying? That sounds like intelligence to me.” To which, Sonam responded with, “Anand, you are also unbearably cranky when hungry.”

A list of remarkable people 
How do you go from strength to strength? You draw on the essence of the remarkable people who personify all that we aspire to be today. We set the bar high when we introduced the Vogue Women of the Year awards last year. The women, and a few good men, featured in our November 2018 issue, only mean we're taking it up a notch. There's the global powerhouse who's put the F-word into our wardrobes. The media magnate who's now proud to be called a sleep evangelist. A crusader who is fighting for the rights of a child, at great personal cost. The track-and-field champions who've made a habit of taking the podium. A voice of reason and truth-seeking in an increasingly shrill television prime-time. The CEO who has taken her family's pharma business to a global market. The textile revivalist who is not done exploring what the nooks of the country have to offer. The actress who went from playing high school kid to the most layered and nuanced roles the celluloid has to offer. The social entrepreneur who is harnessing the power of collective will to bring about great change… Meet the winners of the Vogue Women of the Year 2018.

The pre-wedding celebrations have begun 
It looks like wedding bells are imminent for Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra, as the soon-to-be bride was celebrated at a bridal shower in New York this weekend. After it was reported that Jonas shut down the Tiffany and Co. store to pick out an engagement ring, Chopra's bridesmaids Mubina Rattonsey and Anjula Acharia hosted a lavish party at the Tiffany Blue Box Café. Hollywood heavyweights like Kelly Ripa and Lupita Nyong'o and Chopra's future brother-in-law Kevin Jonas were there to celebrate the bride-to-be. Reports say that friends toasted her, and a DJ was on hand to spin Bollywood tracks for the guests to dance to. The venue was bathed in soft pink and purple light, with candles and a neon “Priyanka” sign to amp up the décor. After the party wound down, the after-party was at the actor's New York home, where guests relaxed and cuddled with her insta-famous puppy, Diana, till the wee hours. 
Before getting into her evening getup, Chopra posted a photo on Instagram stories of herself relaxing with friends as she got her hair and makeup done. Keeping with the romantic and extravagant theme of the party, she was seen wearing a strapless white Marchesa dress that could easily pass off as a wedding gown (maybe hinting at a white wedding for Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas?) paired with a resplendent diamond necklace and nude Christian Louboutin pumps. She wore her hair in soft waves and sported a bold berry lip. 
After a whirlwind romance, Nick and Priyanka got engaged in July and made it official with a roka ceremony in Mumbai in August. Speculations are rife that the couple will marry this year, with multiple ceremonies in the US as well as at the Mehrangarh fort in Jodhpur.

Here’s why you should check it out 
Serbian performance artist Marina Abramović is something of a legend in the art world. Her work ‘The Artist is Present' is amongst one of her most popular performances at the Museum of Modern Art, during which Abramović encouraged members of the audience sit across her in silence and maintain eye contact with her. While Abramović's work is revered for exploring the limits of human mind body, on the other side of the spectrum sits Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan's work, which explores the humorous side of art. 
Cattelan, along with Alessandro Michele, creative director of Gucci, are questioning the concept of originality in art with the exhibition, ‘The Artist is Present', which appropriates its title from Abramović's work. It is common knowledge that originality, intention and expression are sacred principles in the art world. But in today's age, where nearly everything is replicated, Cattelan invokes the challenge—is originality a dated concept? “Copying is like a blasphemy: it could seem not respectful towards God, but at the same time is the significative recognition of its existence,” he explains. 
Gucci's ‘The Artist is Present' will house pieces by other artists like John Armleder, Nina Beier, Brian Belott, Anne Collier, Jose Dávila, Wim Delvoye, Eric Doeringer, Sayre Gomez, Andy Hung Chi-Kin, Matt Johnson, Jamian Juliano-Villani, Kapwani Kiwanga, Ma Jun, Nevine Mahmoud, Reena Spaulings, Superflex, Oscar Tuazon, Kaari Upson, Gillian Wearing, Lawrence Weiner, Christopher Williams, Yan Pei-Ming and Damon Zucconi. In addition, Gucci's Art Walls  in Shanghai, Milan, New York, London and Hong Kong also feature a dedicated mural for the exhibition. Scroll onwards to look at some of the walls across the world that feature the mural, and get a peek inside the exhibition.

We spoke to the designer of the piece, Rooshad Shroff, to get all the details 
As the date for the second edition of Vogue Women Of The Year awards comes closer, the excitement for the event is reaching a crescendo. Organised with the aim to shine a spotlight on women and men in the country who have been trailblazers in their field of choice, the biggest Vogue party of the year was held for the first time on September 27, 2017—and saw everyone from Shah Rukh Khan, Gauri Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Anushka Sharma to Sonam K Ahuja, Akshay Kumar and Athiya Shetty in attendance, among many others. 
If you've been wondering about what the winners of this year will be taking home, you're not the only one. We got in touch with the creator of the Vogue Women Of The Year 2018 trophy, Rooshad Shroff, to divulge the details of the keepsake that will occupy a place of honour in the homes of many celebrities in the country—as well as Dior's Maria Grazia Chiuri's, considering she's our Global Icon of the Year. Scroll on for excerpts from the conversation. 
The entire concept was based on the idea of stronger together—where there are three different elements that, when put together, create a kind of puzzle where everything fits in with each other. Though each piece is seemingly quite simple, they form something quite complex and much stronger, just like the joint. We also took the opportunity to showcase the different kinds of precious stones by The Quarry they have in the pieces of the trophy. 
I work a lot with furniture, and am always looking at different kinds of joinery (a woodworking process that involves the joining together of timber pieces to produce more complex items). The story behind the trophy is one from my childhood, when a carpenter gave presented me with a toy made out of the joint. This trophy is like my play on that kind of toy. 
The design process itself only took about 13 minutes. 
I think there is a sense of playfulness with the trophy that makes it standout. It is like a puzzle that can also be used as a toy. With three different pieces that can be opened up and put back together, it is a sort of mind game too. It can also be considered as a play on the tetrapods we see at Mumbai's Marine Drive—since we are kind of tying it into the city as well then.

We’re talking two completely different types of ceremonies, set against a beautiful Italian backdrop 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh basically broke the internet last Sunday by finally confirming their November wedding. While rumour has it that Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are tying the knot towards the end of the same month, Padukone and Singh marked the November 14 and 15 as the final dates for their nuptials. After rife speculation, the news was finally confirmed on both the actors' Instagram accounts—with wishes pouring in from the entire Bollywood film fraternity—right before she premiered as a guest on the inaugural episode of Koffee With Karan's sixth season. In conversation with Karan Johar and Alia Bhatt, she also revealed that it has been six years since she started dating Singh. Now, a report in Mid-Day gives us the complete wedding schedule for the impending celebrations, slated to take place at Lake Como in Italy and in Mumbai. Also Read: What will Deepika Padukone wear for her wedding? 
The wedding is set to be a four-day affair in Italy with the first function, the sangeet, kicking off on November 13. 
The first wedding will be a traditional Kannadiga ceremony. A source revealed to the publication that, “Since Deepika is a South Indian and Ranveer is of Sindhi-Punjabi origin, the two families decided to follow customs practised by both communities.” 
The second wedding function will be one honouring Singh's origin. “The next day will see the couple solemnise their relationship as per the customs of a North Indian wedding (Anant Karaj),” according to the same source. They further added that the celebrations will be followed by an intimate party on November 15. 
Finally, the couple will host a reception, reportedly at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Mumbai, for all their industry friends. 
It's no secret that Padukone is a fan of Sabyasachi Mukherjee's creations. It is rumoured that the couturier has actually designed the Como leg of the couple's ceremonies, including the stunning outfits that both, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone will be seen wearing. Given that Singh has an eclectic taste in fashion, fans are waiting to see how he will bring it into his wedding ensembles, with Mukherjee's creations. We also took a stab at guessing what Padukone's wedding wardrobe will look like, here. 
Of course, it isn't a Bollywood wedding if there isn't a big fat celebrity-studded party to wrap it up. While the Lake Como ceremonies are open to only the closest family members and maybe some friends, the Mumbai reception will be a much larger event. “Given her deep bond with Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan who had launched her in Bollywood, Deepika was certain that she wants them by her side on the auspicious day. The couple also considers Aditya Chopra and Sanjay Leela Bhansali their mentors,” the source was quoted saying. Others expected to be at the reception include Arjun Kapoor along with the Kapoor family, including Sonam, Anil, and others; Alia Bhatt, a friend and co-star of Singh's; Karan Johar; Priyanka Chopra with Nick Jonas; Zoya Akhtar; Abhishek Bachchan; the Ambanis; Sabyasachi Mukherjee; Shahid and Mira Kapoor; and Karisma Kapoor, among others.

And it boasts an innovative indoor-outdoor design plans 
Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have had everybody falling in love with them ever since they were first spotted together in 2017. Though it wasn't exactly love at first sight for the celebrity couple, their chemistry has been absolutely undeniable right from the get go—probably why it only took Jonas a few months into their much-talked-about relationship to pop the question to Chopra. While the two are rumoured to have visited Rajasthan recently to finalise the venue for their nuptials, a new development in this love story has broken the internet yet again. 
Jonas has not been one to shy away from making grand gestures for his fiancée. He reportedly shut down a Tiffany store when picking a ring for Chopra, and now, it seems like he has gone on to buy his wife-to-be a huge mansion at Beverly Hills in LA, which also happens to be the home of some of Hollywood's most prominent celebrities. 
With sweeping views of the sunny canyons, the mansion sprawls across a massive 4,129sqft, harbours a total of five bedrooms and is rumoured to have cost a whopping USD 6.5 million. The space is replete with contemporary architectural elements—think elevated ceilings, clerestory windows, liberal use of glass and a smattering of artworks—and features an interplay of space and light, further underlining its modernist appeal. 
The luxe interior of the house spills into an airy courtyard, which houses a charming wooden terrace and an infinity pool, making it ideal for both relaxation and entertainment. 
According to the rumours, the couple plans to move into their new home right after their much-anticipated wedding, which is likely to take place at one of India's largest forts, Mehrangarh in Jodhpur. Scroll ahead to sneak a peek at what is reportedly Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' new house in LA.

Vogue India’s October 2018 cover stars got together share their opinion on everything from fashion to culture 
If you want to know if something's cool or not, the easiest way is to look to celebrities. At the Vogue India headquarters, October brings along a reason to celebrate this year, as it marks our 11th anniversary. Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh came together with Portuguese Victoria's Secret Angel Sara Sampaio to grace our cover and commemorate the milestone, and of course, we took the opportunity to get their opinion on the trends that have currently taken over the millennial generation. 
The conversation between the culturally diverse cover stars of our Blurred Lines issue began with them giving each other a crash course to their respective native languages, but soon, their happy-go-lucky attitude had them playing games and rating trends. From letting us in on their take on Snapchat filters (Ranveer is not a fan) to applauding the norm of Netflix and chill, the two had a opinion on everything—and they weren't shy about voicing it out either. Want to know what they had to say? Find out via our video now.

And you’ll never guess what he’s wearing for it 
He's witty, he's exuberant and he's got a way with the stars like nobody else. If you've been wondering who will host the second edition of the Vogue Women of the Year awards, we're finally spilling the beans. This year, Bollywood director Karan Johar will be taking the stage with our long list of guests (keep guessing which stars you'll spot on the red carpet!). We couldn't be more excited, and the same can be said for Johar himself. “I am supremely excited, not nervous,” he smiles. “Hosting is something I've done before. I'm excited because I know it's a prestigious platform, it's also a noble platform; it awards some tremendous women from all walks of life and I can't wait to have lots of fun on stage with a fashionable audience.” 
Taking place on the evening of October 27 at Mumbai's Grand Hyatt hotel, the Vogue Women of the Year awards 2018 will celebrate not just women who are slowly but surely changing the world for the better, but men who are breaking paths too. Last year, British actor Archie Panjabi steered the evening towards a grand end from WOTY's podium while Karan Johar sat front row and also took an award home. “Last year was fun!” he recalls. “I think the special moment for me was Shweta [Bachchan Nanda] and Gauri [Khan] giving the [Vogue Man Of The Year] award to me. They're both girls I've known for many, many years. Shweta I've grown up with and Gauri has been one of my closest friends for the last two and a half decades. So that big moment of them giving an award to me was special to me. I hold that very close to my heart.” 
If you've grown up on Johar's picture-perfect films and tongue-in-cheek Koffee With Karan episodes, there's no escaping the fact that this year's Vogue Women Of The Year host is going to transform the evening into a riot of laughter and unforgettable moments. Can't wait for October 27? We just got Johar to reveal what he's planning to wear on stage, the coolest stars he's ever hosted with, and his biggest hosting fear ever. 
I'm just looking forward to the winners being interactive on stage. I hope that they have fun things to say. The biggest blah moment is when you find that there are winners who are not actually excited enough to say stuff. I know there will be some interaction on stage, I hope that's going to be fun. 
Dolce & Gabbana! I'm wearing an interesting suit that looks a little bit like a bathrobe. 
Praise them in the beginning. Make sure they get so comfortable, so relaxed, that they spill the beans. 
I think you should always dress up because that's the whole idea, right? People are going to watch you, people want to look at you. I don't like going underdressed anywhere. I think if you're dressing up, and there is a red carpet, and there are going to be images and they will be archived for posterity, you might as well make the effort. The loudest thing I've ever worn was a sequinned jacket. I looked like a disco ball on stage! I am half Sindhi so it goes with the territory! 
Shah Rukh Khan and Ayushmann Khurrana. Shah Rukh is not lost on stage ever. He always has something smart to say, he always thinks on his feet… Ayushmann has been a host before this, and he's been an RJ as well. They're both sharp, they think on their feet and they're not new to teleprompters saying things to them. And also, they don't get fazed by last minute instructions. So I love hosting with them. 
I would love to host with somebody like Ranbir Kapoor. I haven't hosted with him. He's a friend and he's fun and he's also energetic in a cool way. Both Ranveer Singh and Ranbir Kapoor are my aspirational co-hosts. 
I hate fumbling on stage. I just hate it. I can't bear it! The second biggest fear I have is when the teleprompter is not in support. 
No after-party for me! I am just going to get into the car and go home to my kids.

Here’s how Bollywood is celebrating the latest wedding announcement 
After months of speculation, all rumours of Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding were finally put to rest with an Instagram post on Sunday. The couple shared an invitation to their awaited nuptials—both in Hindi and English—on their social media channels early last evening, announcing that their wedding ceremonies will be taking place on November 14 and 15. They also took the opportunity to thank their fans for their immense love and support, through the note: 
“With the blessings of our families, gives us immense joy in sharing that our wedding is set to take place on the 14th and 15th of November, 2018. We thank you for all the love you have showered upon us over the years and seek your blessings as we embark on this incredible journey of love, loyalty, friendship and togetherness. 
Lots of love, Deepika and Ranveer.” 
Also See: Here's what Deepika Padukone is probably wearing on her wedding day 
That Singh and Padukone got close to one another and fell in love on the sets of their 2013 film, Goliyon Ki Raasleela-Ram Leela, is known, but the two had never spoken candidly of their relationship till this post. Not that their fans needed an announcement to ship this union anyway—Padukone and Singh's camaraderie, and all those flirty comments they've left on each other's Instagram posts in recent times, were more than enough proof for everyone. Padukone was recently spotted on the couch on the inaugural episode of the sixth season of Koffee with Karan, where she indulged her fans with some details of her relationship, confirming that Singh and her have now been together for almost six years. 
While the actor tried to not let out too many details about her wedding to Karan Johar, she did explain that it will be a small and simple family affair. And though the venue has not been revealed yet, the wedding is reported to take place in Lake Como, Italy. 
Sources state that Padukone has already begun her trousseau shopping with younger sister, Anisha Padukone—and many fans have already taken to Twitter to say they'd love to see the actor as a Sabyasachi bride. After all, she is a known fan of the couturier's regal creations, and has chosen his creations for some of the bigger events in her life. 
As soon as the couple revealed their wedding dates on social media, a barge of congratulatory messages started pouring in from fans, and friends and colleagues in Bollywood alike. While Karan Johar commented on Padukone's post saying, “Lots and pots of love!!!!!!,” with heart emojis, on Singh's post he wrote, “Badhai ho!!!!!!.” Kriti Sanon and Karisma Kapoor both wished the celebrity duo as well, and Sonam K Ahuja commented on Ranveer Singh's wedding card, saying, “Congratulations! And tons of love to both of you!” Priyanka Chopra, who is all set to marry Nick Jonas (reportedly in November, in Jodhpur), was elated by the news too. She commented on Ranveer Singh's account, writing, “Congrats!! Yay!!! Tu hero ban gaya Ranno!!”, and also left a note on Deepika Padukone's post, saying, “Woot woot!! Piya ki ayegi baarat”. Scroll onwards for all the congratulatory posts from Bollywood that you may have missed out on.

We’re thrilled to announce one of our first winners of the Vogue Women of the Year 2018 awards. Maria Grazia Chiuri, creative director, Christian Dior Couture, will be in Mumbai on October 27 to accept this honour at this year’s edition of the annual event 
Months of planning, countless e-mails at all hours between Paris and Mumbai, a shoot and interview at the famed Avenue Montaigne have all come to this—Maria Grazia Chiuri, creative director, Christian Dior Couture, will be in Mumbai on October 27 to accept the Global Icon of the Year honour at Vogue India's second Women of the Year Awards. 
On October 27, all roads will lead to Mumbai's Grand Hyatt, for the second edition of what has already become the year's biggest event. Established to mark the 10th anniversary of Vogue India in 2017, this evening recognises the outstanding achievements by inspiring women across the globe in fields ranging from fashion to film, finance to philanthropy. 
In her two-year tenure as Dior's first female creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri has used design to start a conversation. Her debut collection saw a T-shirt emblazoned with ‘We Should All Be Feminists', which became the season's biggest talking point. She followed it with a version questioning ‘Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?' from Linda Nochlin's essay; she brought back the iconic Saddle bag with a more practical, wearable twist; and her most recent cruise collection paid homage to the strength and beauty of Escaramuzas, Mexico's female rodeo riders. Through her designs, Maria Grazia Chiuri has focused on empowering women with powerful messages and clothes that are relevant for their lives, while still staying true to the house's codes. 
“I am extremely honoured, and very sincerely touched, to be returning to a beautiful country that is so dear to my heart on October 27th to receive this highly symbolic award. To be part of the 'Vogue Women of the Year Awards' as a 'Global Icon' for a prestigious magazine like Vogue India is a huge source of pride for me as a woman, as a committed Feminist and as Artistic Director of the House of Dior. This recognition encourages me to push the limits of my passion to embrace and share extraordinary savoir-faire, to create design that's imbued with meaning and messages, and to continue to weave these links that have always existed between Dior and fashion, art and cultures of the world,” says the designer on this occasion.

Are you feeling old too? 
In case you didn't know it already, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, the film that taught every '90s kid that “love is friendship”, completed two decades yesterday, also marking the 20th anniversary of producer and director Karan Johar's iconic directorial debut in the Indian film industry. The entire cast and crew of the 1998 feature got together to commemorate the occasion, with a party and a special press conference, organised by Karan Johar, featuring lead actors Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerji. 
To give you a quick throwback, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai had won the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 46th National Film Awards ceremony in 2000, along with several other awards in 1999 (the year following its release), including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress at the 44th Filmfare Awards—which may explain why this film enjoys the cult status it does till date. 
At the 20th anniversary celebration yesterday, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerji chatted with Karan Johar, as they recalled anecdotes from the making of the film. “Karan came and narrated an utterly nonsense crap story to me, which is certainly not the one that finally you people saw in the film,” said Shah Rukh Khan. “In his strange way, Karan, the man with many words, tried to impress me with his crap story. So yes, I really did not understand the story when I signed in, and I am glad that I did not get into the story and just went ahead with the conviction of Karan, otherwise the film would have not been the way it came out.” 
As expected, the evening was a star-studded affair, with everyone from Kareena Kapoor Khan—who introduced her best friend and the film's director Karan Johar on stage—Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Twinkle Khanna, Neha Dhupia, Abhishek Bachchan, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra to Zoya Akhtar, Ayan Mukerji and rapper Badshah in attendance, along with many other known names. The younger generation of Dharma Productions was also present here, from Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter, who took to the stage as they recreated the iconic scenes from the movie, to Ananya Pandey and Tara Sutaria, who all are set to make their debut in Student of the Year 2 next year. 
While Varun Dhawan revealed how it was Salman Khan's entry in the film with the song “Saajanji Ghar Aaye” that motivated him to become an actor, Alia Bhatt, who couldn't make it, sent in a special video message sharing her first memory of watching the feature. And Twinkle Khanna, who is known to be the inspiration behind Tina's character in the film, as well as the first choice for the role, quipped in saying how rejecting the film was one of the best contributions from her end to make it a hit. 
In an attempt to reignite fond memories, a social media booth was set up at the event to replicate The Neelam Show, a fictional TV programme from the movie, and a number of colourful postcards featuring popular dialogues like “Pyaar dosti hai” and “I don't like jokes. I don't like you” were spotted here too.

In preparation for our grand evening this year, we list down the coolest things that went down last time 
Right from its debut edition, the Vogue Women Of The Year Awards has been a celebration of magnanimous proportions. Held for the first time last year on September 24, the ceremony saw no holds barred when it came to glamour, and had some of the biggest Bollywood celebrities to the best of Indian fashion designers and women in the fields of sport and finance in attendance. The aim of this night is simple: to shine the spotlight on the most remarkable women (and sone men) that are taking great strides in their career of choice. In case you missed the awards last year, here's a quick flashback to nine of the biggest moments from the ceremony. 
With guests like Nita and Isha Ambani, Natasha Poonawalla, Natalia Vodianova and Roshini Nadar in attendance, the night was all about woman power. Some of the country's best designers were part of the celebration—everyone from Manish Malhotra to Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, Anamika Khanna and Falguni and Shane Peacock attended the event. Twinkle Khanna received the Opinion Maker Of The Year award and made sure we were all in splits with her tongue-in-cheek acceptance speech. Our list of winners also included visionaries like entrepreneur Arundhati Bhattacharya, sportswoman Mithali Raj and Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy. Shah Rukh Khan serenaded our host for the evening, Archie Panjabi, with a romantic song from his movie, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Gauri Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Padma Lakshmi and Shah Rukh Khan took the ultimate #groupfie—one we'd all want to be a part of. Archie Panjabi was dressed in a Gaurav Gupta and IBM gown that lit up each time an award was announced; a first in our country. Karan Johar's best friends, Gauri Khan and Shweta Bachchan Nanda, presented him with his Man Of The Year Award. The party went on till the wee hours of the morning with celebrities and the Vogue team dancing away.

Kensington Palace just confirmed the news of the Duchess of Sussex’s pregnancy through social media 
It's official: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are expecting their first child. The news of the Duchess of Sussex's pregnancy was announced today by Kensington Palace through their social media channels. “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019,” the post says. “Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.” 
The announcement follows weeks of rumours speculating that Markle is pregnant, triggered by the Duchess' recent turn to flowing silhouettes in her wardrobe, instead of more form-fitting options. 
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tied the knot earlier this year on May 19, in a hugely publicised royal wedding that saw celebrities such as Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams, David and Victoria Beckham and George and Amal Clooney on the guest list. The news of Markle's pregnancy was announced right on the heels of another royal wedding, of Princess Eugenie with Jack Brooksbank. The royal family also recently celebrated the birth of Kate Middleton and Prince William's third child, Prince Louis, in April this year. 
Congratulations to the soon-to-be parents!

Everything you need to know 
One of the key goals of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is gender equality and women empowerment, which makes complete sense, considering these phenomenons are of vital importance to accelerating progress in our world. Hot on the heels of India's #MeToo movement, which is raising awareness about the problems women face in the workplace and shining the spotlight on the perpetrators of sexual harassment, comes another piece of good news for Indian women. 
Manasi Kirloskar, executive director and CEO, Kirloskar Systems Limited, has just been appointed as the first United Nations in India Young Business Champion for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As part of her new role, the emerging young business leader will be responsible for focusing on the role of business in development, and will also work with the UN on issues such as climate change, plastic and waste management, and women empowerment. 
A graduate from The Rhode Island School of Design, she worked with Toyota Kirloskar Motor for three years before launching Toyota Material Handling Private Limited. One of her first projects after graduation was to set up as a 300-bed multi-specialty hospital in a joint venture arrangement with a Japanese hospital chain—she worked with specialised materials to build a vibrant environment to aid the healing process at Sakra World Hospital in Bengaluru. And today, one of her latest initiatives is a residential complex, and she has a commercial project in the planning stages too. Kirloskar is also the managing trustee and CEO of Caring with Colour, a non-profit initiative that promotes classroom learning through the arts and activities focused on exploration and innovation. 
When asked about her new role, Kirloskar said, “With privilege comes responsibility and social accountability. I am honoured and inspired by this opportunity to work with the UN as their first Young Business Champion. The SDGs present a unique opportunity for [the] industry to participate in India's growth story for generations to come. Businesses have the potential to become catalysts and accelerators of sustainable development. Through my work here, I look forward to amplifying this message amongst all young business leaders, whether employed, or employers in start-ups themselves.” Kirloskar will now not only help in driving the objectives of the UN India Business Forum, but is also expected to inspire other young leaders and garner their support to achieve the SDGs.

This might just be the best thing you read this year 
When Sally Rooney's debut novel, Conversations With Friends, came out last year, few were prepared for how a seemingly simple plot involving four people—Frances, Bobbi, Nick and Melissa—would turn into a complex, clear and unflinching look at the various levels in which friendships and relationships could operate, not to mention the fact that it came from a 27-year-old. 
Her second book, Normal People, out recently—and a part of this year's Man Booker Prize longlist—takes a boy-meets-girl premise and imbues it with a richness and depth that makes it highly engaging, demanding the single-sitting attention you'd reserve for a le Carré thriller, yet deeply affecting. 
Marianne and Connell live in a small town in Ireland, and attend the same school, but Connell's mother is a cleaner in Marianne's house. They pretend to be strangers at school, but small conversations in Marianne's kitchen sow the seeds for an attraction that ties them through the years. 
While Marianne carries a deep secret that looms large over all her relationships, Connell drags with him an insecurity stemming from a class consciousness and the differences he perceives between him and those around. There are tender moments and cold and brutal withdrawals, perceived slights and varying perspectives on the same incidents, ill-chosen words and misunderstood silences, struggles with power and subjugation, all stemming from each one's contexts. As they go through other people and life trajectories, inevitably finding their way back to each other, there's another question that floats in the air: when Marianne and Connell grow up and shrug off their respective pasts, will they grow apart or together? How surmountable, or otherwise, are the things that made us who we are up to now? 
One line sums up Marianne and Connell's equation: “All these years they've been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contouring to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.” 
Real without being cynical, romantic without being airy, Normal People is the read of the year. 
Normal People by Sally Rooney is available on Amazon.in

“We got the best of her for over six years and for that I will always be grateful” 
I was 33, she was formidable. Introductions were made at suite 234 of The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. My third round of interview for this job. The job. I was five minutes late and sternly reminded of it. Through the 90 minutes that followed, she did not let a smile escape her mouth, lest I warm up to her, or worse, she to me. Among all things fashion that were discussed, questioned and probed, it took our common love for Tom Ford's suit that season to break the ice. I still did not get a smile, but I got a nod. 
That nod, coming from one of fashion industry's most significant purveyors and contributors said it all. I got the job and along with it I inherited her—Anna Harvey, former stylist to Princess Diana, a Condé Nast veteran and now my editorial director. 
We would meet next in London a month later, for my training to become editor-ready. In what I will always remember as my Higgins-Doolittle moment, she first took me shopping to “prepare” me for my very first fashion week. Two coats and three dresses later, she introduced me to my ankles (I was a serial trouser wearer up until then), the potency of black and its place in the life of every fashion insider. If she was stunned by my ability to bombard her with a question a minute, I was amazed by her equanimity at answering each one of them. 
And just like that, with no effort, it got easier to get her to smile, and maybe even laugh. 
Over the next few weeks I would shadow her, see Vogue through her eyes, and embark upon the thrilling and transformative journey of launching the very first issue of Vogue India. 
From there on the team, and I looked forward to her India visits and all that they came to represent—her age-defying energy, shopping trips to Amrapali and Gazdar, seafood and beer meals at Trishna, planning exciting shoots for the magazine and fighting off the sales and marketing teams to preserve the editorial sanctity of each issue. She held no prisoners and always spoke her mind with dignity and directness that was as rare as it was remarkable. For her, we were editorial and they were “the suits”. And church and state could never be one. 
No wonder she was soon anointed “Mummyji”—for being the fiercest champion and cheerleader of the editorial team. 
The familiarity grew into a steady friendship—whether it was my driver whose name she lovingly mis-pronounced, to our then finance director who she found terribly charming, she gained loyalists in us all. We got the best of her for over six years and for that I will always be grateful. However, the true test of the Anna effect was felt after she left—the team and I would find reasons to keep in touch, catch up with her whenever any of us was in London. If not in person, we met frequently on Instagram; she liked all my posts and I liked all of hers. It was my way of keeping Mummyji in my life. 
Mummyji passed away yesterday, losing a tough battle to a tougher illness. And I have lost a mentor and friend. My ankles and I are both grateful for all that you did for us. 
RIP Anna.

Can you guess who it is? 
This week is turning out to be quite special for the captain of the Indian cricket team. Just two days back, the cricketer was awarded the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, which is the country's highest honour in sports—an event he attended with his wife, actor Anushka Sharma. Kohli's wardrobe for the occasion was a sharp suit, a theme we see in most of his looks, but if given a choice, who will the skipper's pick as a sartorial icon? 
The fact that Kohli is smitten with his wife is well-known, considering all the loving updates he treats the couple's fans to on Instagram. But as it turns out, he is bowled over by her wardrobe choices too. The cricketer unveiled his own special edition collection of watches with Tissot yesterday, and let out a juicy (and unprompted) tidbit on the occasion—he admitted that if there was one person's closet he'd like to raid, it would only be his wife's. We sat down with him after the reveal, to find out everything you need to know about the Tissot Chrono XL Classic Virat Kohli special edition watch. 
For starters, the watch is blue in colour with navy blue leather straps, which is obviously very close to my heart because the Indian jersey is blue too—just the colour alone has a very special connect for me. Secondly, it is personalised for me and is made with my creative inputs, which I think is pretty cool. The third thing is the detailing inside the watch; we have replaced the stopwatch number 20 with 18, which is my jersey number, in the colour red. This is the first time this has been done for a Tissot watch. 
I wanted this special edition piece to be different from the other Tissot watches [that were] ever made. Starting with the chrome detailing on the dial—most Tissot watches have gold detailing—and since gold was already done, this was something I wanted, and insisted on. This watch is also limited to 3018 pieces only: 18 because of my Indian Team jersey number, and also because this year in 2018, I will be celebrating my 30th birthday. Also, if you flip the dial, you will see that my navy blue logo is engraved on a white silk-printed case back, and each watch is personalised with my signature. 
The best thing I like about this watch is that you can wear it casually or formally. The black strap and the chrome on the outside of the dial makes it look very formal, yet classy and casual. It has that balance, which lets you take it from day to night, and out for different occasions too. You don't have to think about changing the strap for the different occasions that you might be going to, which I think is the coolest thing. 
I've recently understood that a watch should be classy instead of being loud. It doesn't need to be big or flashing in people's faces. Earlier, I would want my watch to stand out, and [would] think that everyone should notice it, but now I feel I am getting to a stage where I want it to be simple and comfortable. If you notice, all the old fashion trends are coming back. I have lots of watches from Tissot that are old-school with small dials. I love those watches. 
Both. They're both very important. I can't wear a watch I have no idea about. I need to know what the watch does, what are it's specifications. At the same time, the design is crucial also. I wouldn't wear a watch that doesn't feel or look good. So both design and mechanism are equally important 
A good watch always tops the list, but I think a good pair of shoes are very important too. They don't necessarily have to be expensive ones, but just a pair that complements your look. When I envision any of my outfits, I think about the shoes and the watch, and that they should be in sync with each other. They both are the most important accessories, I believe. 
I have about eight. 
I would like to raid Anushka's wardrobe. She's very stylish and she styles me a lot as well. She is responsible for my well-curated cool looks, if you guys think they're cool. 
Smart watches are fine. I've used a few but I don't know how accurate they are. For some people it seems to work like magic. But with some watches, even if people move their hands, it counts it as steps. It's also why I stopped using one, because I thought maybe it's just making me feel good but it's actually not doing that much. 
What fascinates me about making a watch is the precision and the focus that needs to be given to its every minute detail. Everything the experts do in putting a watch together is often taken for granted. I can relate to it in many ways. You need precision to work on your technique regularly, and I'm sure people who make watches don't do it by chance, considering they've been doing it for many years. I think all those things, you need in any sport. Determination, passion, precision, hard work, concentration, focus—these are the things that will give you the results you want.

Amidst India's uprising of #MeToo, Sonam K Ahuja took to the stage as part of a panel at Barkha Dutt's We The Women discussion on October 7, where she spoke about Tanushree Dutta, sexual harassment in Bollywood and the importance of taking a stand. “Women these days are not believed. There's a lot of victim shaming, blaming that happens. If women like us who have a platform and xyz amount of followers don't take a stand then who will?” the 33-year-old actor said in the segment. 
Ahuja, who has been vocal with her opinions on social media platforms and was one of the first people to come out in support of Tanushree Dutta, along with Farhan Akhtar, spoke of Dutta's courage in coming out with her story, “She is not asking to come back into the industry. She is only asking to be heard. It's so unfortunate, nobody took up for her. It was Farhan, Swara and me. Only three of us believed her but people were at press conferences who were not giving opinions when they were asked and when you have the power to move things!” 
The actor, who recently announced that she's taking a break from Twitter because she feels that “It's just too negative,” has been in the news for her remarks about Kangana Ranaut at the event, and has issued a statement that her comments were taken out of context. When asked about the Vikas Bahl issue by Dutt, Ahuja acknowledged Ranaut's recent statements on the issue, “I think Kangana wrote something right? Kangana obviously is Kangana Ranaut, she says a lot of stuff. And sometimes it is hard to take her seriously, but I love the fact that she has spunk and she says what she believes and I really respect her for that.”

I understand why a woman would wait years to disclose a sexual assault. 
Padma Lakshmi, an A.C.L.U. ambassador for immigration and women's rights, recently opened up about her own experience with sexual assault and rape on Twitter. Following is the unedited op-ed by Lakshmi published on Nytimes.com, where she talks about why she has finally decided to share the experience she had chosen not to speak about for 32 years. Find the original article, here. 
When I was 16 years old, I started dating a guy I met at the Puente Hills Mall in a Los Angeles suburb. I worked there after school at the accessories counter at Robinsons-May. He worked at a high-end men's store. He would come in wearing a gray silk suit and flirt with me. He was in college, and I thought he was charming and handsome. He was 23. 
When we went out, he would park the car and come in and sit on our couch and talk to my mother. He never brought me home late on a school night. We were intimate to a point, but he knew that I was a virgin and that I was unsure of when I would be ready to have sex. 
On New Year's Eve, just a few months after we first started dating, he raped me. 
I have been turning that incident over in my head throughout the past week, as two women have come forward to detail accusations against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford said he climbed on her and covered her mouth during an attempted rape when they were both in high school, and Deborah Ramirez said he exposed himself to her when they were in college. 
On Friday, President Trump tweeted that if what Dr. Blasey said was true, she would have filed a police report years ago. But I understand why both women would keep this information to themselves for so many years, without involving the police. For years, I did the same thing. On Friday, I tweeted about what had happened to me so many years ago. 
You may want to know if I had been drinking on the night of my rape. It doesn't matter, but I was not drunk. Maybe you will want to know what I was wearing or if I had been ambiguous about my desires. It still doesn't matter, but I was wearing a long-sleeved, black Betsey Johnson maxi dress that revealed only my shoulders. 
The two of us had gone to a couple of parties. Afterward, we went to his apartment. While we were talking, I was so tired that I lay on the bed and fell asleep. 
The next thing I remember is waking up to a very sharp stabbing pain like a knife blade between my legs. He was on top of me. I asked, “What are you doing?” He said, “It will only hurt for a while.” “Please don't do this,” I screamed. 
The pain was excruciating, and as he continued, my tears felt like fear. 
Afterward, he said, “I thought it would hurt less if you were asleep.” Then he drove me home. 
I didn't report it. Not to my mother, not to my friends and certainly not to the police. At first I was in shock. That evening, I let my mother know when I was home, then went to sleep, hoping to forget that night. 
Soon I began to feel that it was my fault. We had no language in the 1980s for date rape. I imagined that adults would say: “What the hell were you doing in his apartment? Why were you dating someone so much older?” 
I don't think I classified it as rape — or even sex — in my head. I'd always thought that when I lost my virginity, it would be a big deal — or at least a conscious decision. The loss of control was disorienting. In my mind, when I one day had intercourse, it would be to express love, to share pleasure or to have a baby. This was clearly none of those things. 
Later, when I had other boyfriends my senior year of high school and in my first year of college, I lied to them — I said I was still a virgin. Emotionally, I still was. 
When I think about it now, I realize that by the time of this rape, I had already absorbed certain lessons. When I was 7 years old, my stepfather's relative touched me between my legs and put my hand on his erect penis. Shortly after I told my mother and stepfather, they sent me to India for a year to live with my grandparents. The lesson was: If you speak up, you will be cast out. 
These experiences have affected me and my ability to trust. It took me decades to talk about this with intimate partners and a therapist. 
Some say a man shouldn't pay a price for an act he committed as a teenager. But the woman pays the price for the rest of her life, and so do the people who love her. 
I think if I had at the time named what happened to me as rape — and told others — I might have suffered less. Looking back, I now think I let my rapist off the hook and I let my 16-year-old self down. 
I have a daughter now. She's 8. For years I've been telling her the simplest and most obvious words that it took me much of my life to understand: “If anybody touches you in your privates or makes you feel uncomfortable, you yell loud. You get out of there and tell somebody. Nobody is allowed to put their hands on you. Your body is yours.” 
Now, 32 years after my rape, I am stating publicly what happened. I have nothing to gain by talking about this. But we all have a lot to lose if we put a time limit on telling the truth about sexual assault and if we hold on to the codes of silence that for generations have allowed men to hurt women with impunity. 
One in four girls and one in six boys today will be sexually abused before the age of 18. I am speaking now because I want us all to fight so that our daughters never know this fear and shame and our sons know that girls' bodies do not exist for their pleasure and that abuse has grave consequences. 
Those messages should be very clear as we consider whom we appoint to make decisions on the highest court of our land.

Don’t miss her cake! 
In case you didn't know it already, September 21, 2018 marks Kareena Kapoor Khan's 38th birthday. And last night, both the Kapoor and Khan families came together to celebrate the occasion with the sweetest little house party. Look back at their many celebrations, and you'll realise that the Kapoor sisters have always been pros at bringing in birthdays with a bang. When Karisma Kapoor turned 44 this year, the siblings marked the big day with a family picnic at London's Hyde Park, and when Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi completed one year, pictures from the his star-studded birthday festivities at the Pataudi Palace immediately took over the internet. So what went down on the eve of Kareena Kapoor Khan's birthday last night? Read on to find out. 
To mark her 38th birthday this year, Kareena Kapoor Khan opted for a cosy get-together with her favourite people at her Mumbai residence, Fortune Heights. There to celebrate her big day were parents Babita and Randhir Kapoor, husband Saif Ali Khan, sister Karisma Kapoor and cousins Shaira and Zahan Kapoor, along with Soha Ali Khan Pataudi and Kunal Kemmu. 
For the get-together, the actor's Bandra apartment was decked out with pink and silver balloons, along with a few fun champagne bottle balloons. And Khan's guests also added to the celebratory mood with pink and white party hats and matching birthday whistles. 
Despite not having an official social media account, Kareena Kapoor Khan is a trendsetter. And this year, her birthday cake was decorated to reflect her superstar personality. Made by Mumbai bakery Love Sugar & Dough, the silver cake matched Khan's party balloons perfectly, and was mounted with a glittering sign that read ‘Happy Birthday Bebo'. Perched on top of the cake was a fondant miniature of the star herself, dressed in a cut-out black evening gown with a glass of wine in hand. If her outfit looks familiar to you, it's because you've seen Khan wearing the exact same gown earlier this week for an ad shoot. 
A self-confessed T-shirt and jeans girl, Kareena Kapoor Khan brought in her birthday in her go-to outfit. This year, the slogan tee loyalist cut her cake in a Gucci T-shirt printed with the artwork of “Someone Saved My Life Tonight”, an Elton John song from the album Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy. It comes as no surprise that Khan picked a tee that looks back to music from the '70s, as husband Saif Ali Khan is a big fan of classics from the yesteryears. Khan tucked her T-shirt into a pair of perfectly tailored denims, and completed her at-home party look with nude wedges. Sister Karisma Kapoor coordinated her look with the birthday girl's, wearing her wide-legged jeans with a black T-shirt. One of the sweetest pictures from the evening was that of the siblings posing with their mom Babita Kapoor between them.

“I am excited to start our lives together,” the singer-songwriter said on a televised US talk show 
If there's one couple the world can't stop talking about right now, it's got to be Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra. The duo were first spotted together back in 2017 on the Met Gala red carpet, where they both were dressed in Ralph Lauren. A little over a year later, they haven't only topped everyone's list of favourite celebrity couples, but have also made fans everywhere do a double take by making things official with a surprise roka ceremony at Chopra's Mumbai residence in July. 
Both Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas had remained tight-lipped about their relationship when the rumours of their coupling were flying about, but have considerably opened up post their engagement. While Chopra loves filling up her Instagram feed with pictures with her fiancé, Jonas has gone on record to share details of their lives not once, but twice. Most recently, it was TV host Jason Kennedy who got Jonas to give us all a peek into his and Chopra's camaraderie. The musician spoke about how his relationship with Chopra first started, saying “The thing that really connected both of us is our love for family and faith, and [the] importance of being connected to those who are always going to be with you. And we found that in each other as well, which is a beautiful thing and I am excited to start our lives together.” 
The 26-year-old singer-songwriter also revealed the story behind the adorable video his mother Denise Jonas recently shared of herself dancing with Chopra's mom, Madhu Chopra, at the roka. "It's a lot of love. We had a beautiful time, we went to India and did a beautiful roka ceremony. It sort of combined the two families, her side and my side.” 
In the past, Jonas has also revealed what could officially become his and Priyanka Chopra's couple nickname, and it's too funny for you to miss out on. Find out what it is here, and scroll on for a peek at some of the couple's sweetest post-engagement pictures together.

Check out his little kurta! 
When it comes to celebrity kids, few have the country charmed like Taimur Ali Khan. Whether the toddler's making his way to a play date, taking a nap at the airport or enjoying a family vacation overseas, he manages to top trending charts each time a new picture of him surfaces on the internet. And given India's love for all things festive, it comes as no surprise that the photographs that cause the most excitement amongst his followers are those of Taimur at Indian events like pujas and weddings. When he attended Sonam K Ahuja's Anand Karaj in a little pink kurta, his wedding attire caught everyone's attention, and there's no missing his adorable Raksha Bandhan pictures with siblings Sara Ali Khan, Ibrahim Ali Khan and cousin Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. Love tracking the toddler? Here's a look at his latest festive outing. 
Post Rakhi get-together with his siblings, Taimur Ali Khan got his festive mode on once again for Ganesh Chaturthi. This time, the little Nawab accompanied mother Kareena Kapoor Khan on a visit to aunt Rima Jain's Mumbai residence, where the duo got to spend some quality time with their extended family members. One of the sweetest pictures to emerge from the afternoon outing was this group shot of Taimur tucked into Kapoor Khan's lap, sitting alongside Rima Jain, her sons Aadar and Armaan Jain, and family friend Anissa Alia Malhotra. 
Just like his father Saif Ali Khan, Taimur Ali Khan seems to have a closet full of classic kurtas. This Ganesh Chaturthi, he paid his respects to the elephant God in a tiny ivory kurta embroidered with little baby blue blooms along the sleeves, hemline and collar. It looks like Taimur's outfit for the day may have been coordinated with his mom's, considering Kareena Kapoor Khan picked a white outfit trimmed with red for the occasion as well. 
One of the highlights of any festival is being able to catch up with one's nearest and dearest. Post their Ganpati darshan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi made sure to meet up with the Jain family. While Armaan Jain was seen feeding nephew Taimur special treats, Aadar Jain turned the family get-together into an impromptu football lesson for the toddler. One of the cutest videos from the afternoon is that of Taimur kicking his light-up toy around as his family cheers him on.

We got you covered 
Television has been the joy of our lives for a long, long time—whether it was through good old local networks and their quaint programming in the past, or through the unparalleled access we currently enjoy to international shows from all over the globe. We have a number of awards already in place to celebrate the biggest names in the world of televised entertainment, and among the most popular are the Emmy Awards, which have been honouring the best in US prime time television programming for the past 70 years now. Since we now have access to these shows via streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, the number of fans invested in the winners has grown from strength to strength in last few years. Missed the starry night? Don't worry; we have all the updates you need to know right here. Read on. 
The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards gave us everything that a great show does; drama, surprise wins, underdog triumphs… and even a proposal. The awards ceremony was opened by Kate McKinnon and Kenan Thompson, who broke into a tongue-in-cheek song titled, “We Solved It” on stage to address the the issue of diversity. The two were joined by the likes of Kristen Bell, Andy Samberg and Sterling K Brown, while Michael Che and Colin Jost addressed the diversity issue in Hollywood in their monologue later on. Read on for our round-up of iconic moments from the ceremony at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. 
Glenn Weiss won the award for directing Oscars on ABC, but he took home more than just the trophy. In one of the sweetest moments seen on TV, the director proposed to his girlfriend Jan Svendsen during his winning speech. And she said yes! 
The first ever Asian actor to be nominated for a lead female actor category, Sandra Oh (for Killing Eve) may have missed on winning the award, but she won hearts with her dates to the starry function—her parents. 
Nominated for 22 Emmys this year, Game of Thrones won three awards—Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Special Visual Effects, and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, which was taken home by Peter Dinklage. 
Amazon Prime's The Marvelous Mrs Maisel swept the awards show with a grand total of three awards—Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Rachel Brosnahan, and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for Alex Borstein. 
Move over Netflix and chill, it's now Netflix and win! The streaming giant took home a total of 23 awards, meaning it won the most Emmy awards of any TV network last night. 
RuPaul's Drag Race has been a beloved reality show for years, and the show took home three awards this time—Outstanding Directing for a Reality Program, Outstanding Reality-Competition Program and Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. 
Diversity was a theme that permeated every aspect of the award show this year, and while it was reflected in the opening monologues, the “We Solved It” number and nominations themselves, co-host Michael Che presented “Reparations Emmys” in a special segment, handing out awards to famous black actors from iconic TV shows. And if that doesn't send out a strong statement, what does?

The popular hashtag may have restricted throwbacks to Thursdays in your mind, but Shahid Kapoor is having none of your limitations. The actor took to Instagram to share an adorable image of him being seated next to his wife Mira Rajput Kapoor recently, and captioned it #throwback, letting his fans know that Monday is not too soon to reminisce good memories. 
  
Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor just welcomed their little baby boy, Zain Kapoor about a fortnight ago, and have been quite under the radar since. Though we haven't gotten a first look at the youngest Kapoor yet, fans can't seem to get enough of this endearing picture of his parents. Shahid Kapoor tied the knot with Mira Rajput Kapoor back in July 2015, and the couple is also parents to two-year-old Misha. The celebrity duo announced their second pregnancy back in April with the sweetest post on Instagram: a picture of little Misha smiling next to a chalk doodle spelling out “Big sister”.

The actor shares her story here 
2018 continues to be the year of celebrations for the biggest names of the film and fashion fraternity. And the most recent good news comes from Indo-Canadian actor Lisa Ray. Just yesterday, the star just took to Instagram to announce the arrival of her twin daughters Sufi and Soleil, who were born via surrogacy, and like every new mom, she hasn't stopped gushing about her new role in life since. “Motherhood is like drilling into your heart. It's also like trying to change your clothes in the middle of a roller coaster ride—new skills all the way. There's a new level of anarchy and love in my life now, but also a fullness that's hard to describe,” she told us. 
Ray, who tied the knot with long-time partner Jason Dehni in 2012, wants to break the stigma attached to surrogacy, and believe it can only be done if more people speak openly about the process. “Our girls were born in Tbilisi, Georgia. We chose Georgia finally as surrogacy is legal and well supported there. Tbilisi was a beautiful city as well. I stayed there for two months; Jason flew in for their birth but had to return to Hong Kong shortly after,” she told us. 
Ray had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma (a form of blood cancer) in 2009 and requires her to be on medication for the rest of her life, and thus, she would not be able to carry the children herself. “When I was younger, I didn't want kids,” she told us. “But after going through multiple myeloma and getting married at 40, my inner beliefs changed. I started feeling, I would like to be a mom. But cancer treatment had put an end to my fertility and the medication I take, means I can't carry a child. I honestly didn't mourn that aspect of my life as we are so fortunate to have options. We also wanted to explore adoption, but thought surrogacy would be quicker as international adoption is a lengthy process. We were wrong. Surrogacy was a long, hard... heartbreaking road to travel, but I've forgotten about the difficulties now. People tell me labour is something similar—agonising when you are in it, but all the pain is forgotten once you hold your baby.” 
Because there are only a limited number of huge surprises in life, Ray and her husband were sure they didn't want to know the genders of their twins. “I thought we were going to have a boy and girl, so we picked names [accordingly]. When it turned out to be two girls, I was completely delighted, but we had to rethink names,” she said. “I wanted to spend a few hours with them to see who they were. Then we remembered—when Jason and I got engaged in Napa Valley we stayed at a places called Auberge du Soleil, the Inn of the Sun. And we decided if we have a daughter we would name her Soleil. Sufi is about love, music and the mystery of life—it was a natural fit. Of course, in some small way, it's a way to honour Nusratji [Fateh Ali Khan] and his legacy as well. Then my husband realised that Sufi plus Soleil equals Soufflé—the best, most delicate, hardest to execute dish.” 
Being a mother certainly seems to agree with Ray. “I'm growing into motherhood,” she told us. “No one tells you your relationship with your children will grow day by day. You love them but you start out strangers. Slowly they teach me who they are. They are opposites in nature—Sufi is strong willed and restless already, she scrutinises the world like a CEO and Soleil looks at everything with wonder, like a poet.” When asked about her plans for their future, she said, “I want to allow them to be who they are meant to be, to be free while at the same time keeping them alive and safe and offering guidance when it matters. I don't know how it's going to turn out, but that doesn't matter either. When I look at them, I see hope and wild, untamed dispositions.”

It’s happening 
It's been five years since Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh first worked together for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon ki Raasleela Ram-Leela. Since then, the actors haven't just lit up the silver screen in three more films, but also become one of Bollywood's favourite duos off-screen. When they're not dancing together at friends' weddings, you can spot the couple enjoying intimate date nights in Mumbai, or looking picture-perfect on red carpets all over the world. Back in 2015, the pair also graced the cover of Vogue India's 8th anniversary issue, during which Singh revealed his feelings for his co-cover star saying, “Nobody looks at anything else when Deepika is in the frame… I wouldn't.” 
The #Deepveer rumour mills haven't stopped dissecting every information they get about the couple's upcoming nuptials. And the latest news doing the rounds? Director Karan Johar, who is currently hosting a show about love on a radio channel, was asked to accept or deny the rumours surrounding Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding recently, and his response was simple: “I am not denying.” Padukone echoed his response just days ago when asked about her wedding at an event in Delhi on September 8, saying, “I am not telling anything on marriage.” But that didn't stop us from digging through our sources to get the details anyway. Here's everything we found out the couple's big day. 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh seem to have found their perfect spot in Lake Como, one of Italy's most scenic regions. The couple are rumoured to be tying the knot on November 10 in the presence of their closest family members and friends. “Both Ranveer and Deepika were keen on having a destination wedding in Italy and they have finalised Lake Como as their wedding destination. The place is dotted with exquisite villas along the shoreline, which is why both of them decided to wed in this beautiful place. The family was also toying with the idea of Udaipur palace but that didn't work out,” a source told publications. “The maximum time was taken to decide the date. Both Ranveer and Deepika want everything about their marriage to be perfect. November 10 suited their calendars as well as their parents. The roka was done long back and the wedding date was finalised just few weeks ago.” 
No wedding is complete without its pre-wedding rituals, and Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's big day will be no different. Ten days prior to the couple's Lake Como wedding, mother-of-the-bride Ujjala Padukone will be putting together a Nandi puja at the Padukone residence in Bengaluru. 
“Preparations are in full swing from both sides,” a source revealed about the wedding recently. While most brides opt for gold or diamond jewellery, rumour has it that Padukone and family have invested heavily in silver jewellery for her big day. Given that the bride is a Sabyasachi loyalist, one can assume that her trousseau (and possibly her wedding outfits) will include several of the couturier's creations. Stay tuned to this space for all the updates.

From Priyanka Chopra to Shraddha Kapoor 
It's safe to say that Ganesh Chaturthi is one of India's biggest festivals, and it feels like the celebrations only get bigger with each year. In Priyanka Chopra's words, Ganesh Chaturthi is “a festival where we invoke the blessings of Lord Ganesh, the remover of obstacles.” 
On September 13, Bollywood's biggest stars joined the country in celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi by sharing their well wishes with fans on social media, and stepped out to meet their friends and family for Ganapati darshans. Missed all the action? Here's a quick recap. 
Every year, Arpita Khan Sharma celebrates Ganesh Chaturthi on a grand scale at her Mumbai home and this time was no different. Spotted at the Sharma residence were Salman Khan, Sophie Choudry, Huma Qureshi, Athiya Shetty and Dia Mirza, along with newer Bollywood faces including Ananya Panday. Joining them at the festivities were Ahaan and Alanna Panday, along with Katrina and Isabelle Kaif. To mark the occasion, Kaif shared a video of Sharma's Ganpati aarti on her Instagram page. Check it out here. 
Another big get-together this year was that of Nita and Mukesh Ambani's, which was attended by everyone from Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan to Amitabh Bachchan. Click here for a peek at what everyone wore to Antilia, plus inside pictures from the evening. 
Just like Arpita Khan Sharma and the Ambanis, Shraddha Kapoor and Shilpa Shetty Kundra brought Ganapati to their homes this year too. Both stars made sure to share pictures from their house festivities with their followers, as did Kangana Ranaut (who celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi with her nephew Prithvi), Neetu Kapoor and Raveena Tandon. Hrithik Roshan also shared a glimpse Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations at his home with special videos. 
While there's no missing the cheer and positivity that Ganesh Chaturthi brings with it, the festival also unfortunately causes a jump in water pollution, caused by the immersion of Ganapati idols in India's water bodies. Akshay Kumar's latest post served as a reminder to all that it's important to protect our environment at all costs. If you've been wondering about how you can have a more eco-friendly Ganesh Chaturthi, make sure you read this, and scroll on to see how Sonam K Ahuja, Shahid Kapoor and others celebrated the festival.

Who joined Gauri Khan, Katrina Kaif and Kareena Kapoor Khan at Antilia? 
When the Ambani family hosts a get-together, you can be rest assured that it's going to be a grand one. This weekend, Nita Ambani and husband Mukesh Ambani opened the doors to their Mumbai home, Antilia, for an unmissable Ganesh Chaturthi puja that saw their closest friends and family members in attendance, including some of Bollywood's favourite stars. On the guest list this time around were Amitabh Bachchan and daughter Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Shah Rukh Khan and wife Gauri Khan, Katrina Kaif, sisters Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor, Rekha, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Aamir Khan and Athiya Shetty. But that's not all. Sportsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan, designer Manish Malhotra, director Karan Johar and philanthropist Natasha Poonawalla were also spotted joining in for the auspicious festivities. 
One of the most exciting aspects of any Ambani party has got to be the decor. Each time the family hosts a celebration, they make sure to give their driveway a makeover to match with the theme of the occasion. While the entrance of their home was decked out in royal blue last year to celebrate 10 successful years of the Mumbai Indians, we also saw the front doors of Antilia drenched in oversized blooms for a fairytale vibe at Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement celebrations earlier this year. 
For Ganesh Chaturthi on September 13, the Ambanis added a festive touch to their residence once again. Antilia's entrance was decorated with rows of white, red and orange flowers this time, with hundreds of gold Om signs hung from the ceiling. 
Just like the outside of Antilia, the inside of the Ambanis' Mumbai residence brimmed with flowers and customised decorations this Ganesh Chaturthi. For starters, the area where guests were served snacks featured statues of the elephant god made out of red, white and orange flowers, along with celebratory floral signs that were mounted onto the walls. The main Ganapati statue sat on a throne on a special stage surrounded by more floral decorations. 
India's festive season is finally here, giving us all a chance to pull out our favourite new Indian ethnic looks. And Bollywood was no exception to this. While the host for the evening, Nita Ambani, celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi in a regal maroon Sabyasachi lehenga, her guests were spotted in several note-worthy looks too. Both Katrina Kaif and Ileana D'Cruz made their entrances in scarlet outfits, Kareena Kapoor Khan twinned with Karisma Kapoor in a bold shade of yellow, Madhuri Dixit Nene walked in wearing a blue sari and Rekha opted for a green Kanjivaram drape. Among those who preferred lighter hues was Gauri Khan, who walked in wearing a white and cream kurta, while Athiya Shetty posed with her family in a pale green Rahul Mishra anarkali and Hema Malini looked elegant as ever in a lilac sari. Check out their looks below, and don't miss our favourite inside pictures from the evening too. Keep scrolling for all the updates.

Respect your environment 
Every year, the festival honouring the Elephant God is seen as a sign of new beginnings that bring his followers wisdom, prosperity and good fortune. Unfortunately, on a rather unwise note, the water pollution caused due to immersing of the idols couldn't be further away from that takeaway. That's not all, the 10-day long celebrations are also met with high decibels of music pounding at the pandals and increase in traffic on the streets owing to the processions. 
It's easy to get carried away with lavish extravagance during the festive season. This Ganesh Chaturthi, we offer you a refresher course in being a responsible citizen. Celebrate the religious festival bearing in mind the consequences of your doing. Here are steps you can take to avoid causing civic nuisance as you partake in the festivities. 
Possibly the biggest change you must bring about is to opt for an alternate idol. Ideally, choose one that can be reused each year. Opt for ones carved from marble, stone or cast in brass or silver. If you're against the idea, pick options in biodegradable materials like red soil clay. Paper mâché is also a great alternative for those who may want to create their own idols, since the materials are readily accessible and easy to work with. Use reusable decorations such as beautiful ribbons and zari cloth backgrounds. Create a small vertical garden, or hang floral steamers for decorating purposes. Use eco-friendly materials such as jute and glass beads to decorate the shrine. Fairy lights and tea lights can also help brighten up the space, and can be reused throughout the festive season too. For the traditional rangoli, make sure you're choosing eco-friendly colours. Refrain from playing loud music as you entertain your guests. Stick to the mood and choose soft, ambient tunes over the tracks you would normally play at a sangeet function. If you must immerse your idol, look for NGOs in your area that offer eco-friendly visarjan services. Instead of crowding the streets with a procession of 30, limit the number to individuals to fit in one car, and keep it low-key.

How hilarious and adorable can these two be? 
With a whirlwind romance spanning from 2017's edition of the Met Gala to an engagement ceremony in Mumbai, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have been making headlines with every move they make over the past few months. From cycling dates in New York to family vacations in Goa, these two have done it all, and then some more. They made their first public appearance as a couple at Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani's pre-engagement sangeet party, and soon enough, we heard news of Jonas proposing to Chopra on her birthday—the Quantico star was seen flashing her engagement ring on Instagram. And just last month, Jonas flew in with his parents to Mumbai for a private engagement ceremony, followed by a celebratory party at Chopra's Mumbai residence. 
If there was one thing missing from all the excitement surrounding this celebrity coupling, it was the lack of an official nickname. Now though we may not be anywhere close to finalising one yet, it looks like Chopra and Jonas have something to say on the matter. The singer-songwriter stopped by at The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon on Friday to promote his latest song “Right Now”, where he also revealed the nickname that his fiancee liked. Considering that the couple is such a hot topic currently, Fallon had all sorts of questions regarding their romance. Chopra, who was supporting her beau from the wings, spoke out when Fallon asked which couple nickname she liked. Turns out, Chopra's pick 'Pr-ick', which Jonas is still warming up to. 
In addition, Jonas also spoke about how the couple had met through a friend and connected over text first, but didn't actually meet in-person until about six months later, when they attended the Met Gala 2017 together. Jonas insisted that they went only as friends, because their lives were taking them to different places at the time. It was only in the subsequent weeks that the couple spent a lot of quality time together. 
Jonas also mentions that both him and Chopra were continuously questioned about their relationship status, but it wasn't until about five months ago that they knew that this was just right.

US Open fans witnessed the most controversial Grand Slam finals ever on Saturday at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, but controversies have always existed in the world of tennis 
When Serena Williams, who is considered the greatest female tennis player of our times, lost to 20-year-old Naomi Osaka at the US Open 2018, the world was divided. Williams lost the game 6-2 and 6-4 but had a problem with the umpire's distribution of points. Williams was handed three-code violation for calling umpire Carlos Ramos a “liar” and a “thief”, and also smashing her racket on the court. When Osaka won the title against her own idol, she was in tears as the crowd booed her. The Haitian-Japanese player did her best to maintain her composure as she fought through the mixed feelings of her win, which were tainted by Williams's rants. 
And this is not the first time Williams had a trouble with her temper either. The tennis player has also lost her cool at the line umpire for calling a foot fault during the 2009 US Open semi-finals against Kim Clijsters. Not only did she lose that match, she was also charged with a fine of $10,500. 
Athletes losing their cool on the court is not exactly a rare occurrence. Here are some historic meltdowns in tennis history. 
McEnroe abused the umpire during the semi-finals of the 1984 Swedish Open while playing against Anders Jarryd, who was then the sixth ranked player in the world. 
During the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe played against Mikael Pernfors and was disqualified for intimidating the line umpire, abusing the umpire and smashing his racket on the court. 
Henman was disqualified for losing his temper and accidentally hitting a ball girl during the 1995 Wimbledon doubles. 
David Nalbandian was disqualified for injuring a linesman during an angry outburst at the 2012 AEGON Championship. 
Shapovalov was disqualified for losing his temper at Kyle Edmund, breaking his serve and accidentally hitting the umpire with the ball at the 2017 David Cup.

Granular Times by Gaurav Jai Gupta comes to Bungalow 8, Churchgate 
Just in time for the festive season, Gaurav Jai Gupta's Akaaro has come up with a line of handwoven saris titled ‘Granular Times'. The label will release the collection in an exhibition on September 7, 2018, at Mumbai's multi-designer store, Bungalow 8, where you can be prepared to find 50 saris in Gupta's classic handwoven style. With a slew of events planned for wedding season, anyone who identifies with Akaaro's pared-back glamour can head over to the South Mumbai spot to get their fix of innovative saris that blend silk, cotton, wool and metal in the six yard staple. 
Coming together at the launch with the designer du jour is textile revivalist and sari aficionado, Jaya Jaitly, for a walkthrough. With books like Craft Atlas of India (2012), The Artistry of Handwork (2014) and Woven Textiles of Varanasi (2014) to her name, Jaitly will bring an academic approach to the exhibition for those who want to understanding the starting points and unique beauty of each handcrafted sari. 
Over the last decade, the designer has worked with weavers from Phulia, Chanderi and Varanasi in India to bring this collection together. “As a garment, the sari has a unique heritage which creates its own challenges and limitations for a designer. We have to be understanding towards the cultural significance of the garment as we bring a contemporary interpretation to it. The end result reflects a contemporary take of the sari without straying too far from history and culture—it's like staging a modern and contemporary interpretation of a raaga,” says Gupta. 
Scroll onwards to take a first look at the Akaaro's new collection.

In a landmark judgement, a bench of judges including Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra ruled in favour of the Indian LGBT community, scrapping parts of the infamous Section 377 and decriminalising homosexuality. Here are some of the most heartening reactions from the spectrum and beyond 
After a long ongoing battle against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises gay sex, the Supreme Court of India finally released a verdict that sent cheers through the country. The Indian judiciary system has finally amended the regressive chapter that dates all the way back to 1861, as a violation of fundamental rights. A monumental win not only for the LGBTQIA community but for the entire nation, the morning of September 6, 2018 is brimming with emotion and pride. 
We spoke to members of the celebrity and the LGBTQIA community to share their joy with us, right after the verdict was declared. 
“The health of any country essentially can be judged by the safety of all its citizens, and I think today my faith in the judicial system and the democracy of India has been restored. Dipak Mishra has paved the way for the future. Can you imagine all these young kids living in the constant fear, now being able to live their lives legally and openly, with the freedom of choices? Their parents surely won't have to worry about the societal pressures. Of course, there will be a stigma attached to homosexuality for a long time but the very fact that it's no longer illegal will be a massive instrument of change, and I think that it sets a benchmark of how people will also feel in the future.” — Suneet Varma, designer 
“I'm reading about the verdict as we talk. I have so much respect for the Indian judiciary system now. With the turn of events in the last few years, one began to question if India was still a functioning democracy, but now my faith has been restored all over again. I'm happy, I'm relieved, and at the risk of sounding arrogant, I'm proud of myself.” — Ritu Dalmia, chef 
“A progressive outlook beholds a progressive country. Congratulations India, we're 'striping' down the right path. Today we can proudly call ourselves a true democracy.” — Ashiesh Shah, architect and interior designer 
“Overwhelmed, dewy eyes, this is what freedom fighters must have felt in 1947.” — Nimish Shah, designer 
"This is huge! We are finally legal! This is culture, this is evolution! I am crying with joy. Love always wins" 
—Gaurav Gupta, designer 
“Imagine being truly in love and waking up everyday knowing you have to hide, conceal and feel shame or remorse simply because you could be targeted for the natural good your heart feels. Living a parallel life is no real fun. Today, that freedom is rightly ours... not just to love, but to live and thrive, to be proud of our nature and to stand for equal human rights, to forge new paths and careers, to be brave and know that Lady Justice has our back, to forgive those that have wronged [us] and continue to wrong us because they know no better. The future is now paved with dignity and that fills me with joy and happy tears." —Elton J Fernandez, hair and makeup artist 
“I feel the same way I would have felt at the stroke of midnight on the August 14, 1947.” — Amit Aggarwal, designer 
“Today marks a very important victory, in the timeline that is the brown queer resistance. I feel overwhelmed with joy for my homosexual brothers and sisters. And I'm very grateful to the allies. As a trans woman, I now can't wait to be that one female friend at my gay best friend's wedding, who makes it about herself.” — Randy Scarhol, trans model 
“There are no words to describe this feeling. When you have lived your whole life under a draconian law that makes you less than equal as a citizen of country, and less than equal for your choice of love, words cannot convey what this change means. I feel like how Nelson Mandela must have felt after being at Robben Island. I feel joy, relief and a whole lot of gratitude for all the warriors who have fought for the decriminalisation of 377 for over two decades now. I'm grateful for the Supreme Court judges for upholding this right in India. It is such a powerful judgement and paves the way for more progressive judgments in India in the coming future. Let's not forget that this only decriminalises us, we still have to fight to be equal—to have the same rights to marry, adopt children and live with the ones we love.” — Parmesh Shahani, head of Godrej India Culture Lab 
“It means the beginning of a change in India for all citizens. These are human rights. Until we all have equal rights, we are not free.” — Punit Jasuja, interior designer 
“It's overwhelming how many people have been rooting for this verdict to come through and it's great that India can also finally come out of its closet! This is for everyone who's ever been afraid to speak their truth—and now justice has our backs.” — Akshay Tyagi, stylist 
“Finally, this is a rejection of majoritarianism, and I hope this sees the beginning of a more inclusive  society.” — David Abraham, designer 
“It feels so freaking great. I have been dancing, laughing, crying, singing, jumping up and down since I woke up. I don't know if I'm still asleep in my dream or I've woken up! This feels like a really warm hug from the world right now.” — Durga Gawde, artist and activist 
“They say too much blood has flown from the wrists of the children shamed for who they chose to kiss. It's a new dawn for compassion and acceptance in this county. Well done, India! We still have a lot of work to do.” — Anand Bhushan, designer 
“I've always been an advocate of free love. Now that the verdict is out and it's positive, I'm sure it's lifted a huge weight off a lot of people to now also love more fearlessly.” — Justine Rae Mellocastro, hairstylist

Did you miss all the updates from this starry family holiday? 
When it comes to vacations, Bollywood celebrities have everyone else beat. Currently, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan are holidaying in the Maldives with Soha Ali Khan and Kunal Kemmu, and the family's young ones, Taimur Ali Khan and Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. Pictures of the celebrity couples (and their toddlers) went viral over the weekend, and it looks like we have more to ogle now—photos from the starry vacation are currently making the rounds on the internet, and each one is more envy-inducing than the one before it. 
If you'd taken a sabbatical from the internet over the last two days, you probably missed all the pictures of the Kareena and Saif heading to their family holiday with a sleepy-eyed Taimur. Saif Ali Khan kept things casual for his flight out as he carried his son in his arms, dressed in a casual beige shirt and jeans combination that he made holiday-appropriate with a fedora, while Taimur was seen in an adorable blue pyjama set featuring printed stars and Kapoor Khan joined them in a breezy white maxi and a jacket. 
Like most dads, Saif Ali Khan looked excited as the family landed at their holiday destination, and was clicked making funny expressions at the camera as his son napped on his nanny's shoulder. Did you spot the cap being used to protect Taimur's little head from the sun? It's the same one we saw his father had on while departing from Mumbai airport. Next, our feeds were greeted with images of the celebrity family on a yacht, shared by Soha Ali Khan on her Instagram stories. Kapoor Khan was seen twinning with Taimur in all-white here, while Khan zoned out to music as they sailed over blue waters. 
And it looks like a pool came into the picture soon after—this time with everyone on vacation in the same frame. The Rang De Basanti actor posted a photo of herself with the entire family in a swimming pool, which explained exactly why this celebrity vacation is being followed so closely on the internet. 
But it doesn't look like the family's done turning its fans green with envy yet. In another photograph posted on Soha Ali Khan's Instagram feed, Kapoor Khan can be seen posing hand-in-hand with her husband, dressed in a bright pink bikini that she layered with a long shrug. We also spotted the Veere Di Wedding actor teaming up with Kunal Kemmu to keep the kids busy with a colouring session at the holiday. 
Scroll onwards to have a look at all the pictures from Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan's Maldives vacation now and catch up on all they're up to.

Two years after the birth of their daughter Misha Kapoor, Bollywood actor Shahid Kapoor and wife Mira Rajput Kapoor welcomed a little baby boy, Zain Kapoor, into their family on September 5, 2018. The second-time father announced his son's name on Twitter with the sweetest post, which has already started receiving responses from friends within the industry. 
Zain Kapoor is here and we feel complete. Thank you for all the wishes and blessings. We are overjoyed and so grateful. Love to all. ❤🙏 
— Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) September 7, 2018 
Most recently seen grabbing a bite with Shahid in a denim maternity dress earlier this week, Mira was rushed to Mumbai's Hinduja Hospital for delivery on the evening of September 5, and the couple's family members were also seen entering the hospital to meet and congratulate the second-time parents. There to get the first glimpse of the baby were Mira's mother Bela Rajput, Shahid's mother Neelima Azim, and his younger brother Ishaan Khatter. 
Shahid and Mira Rajput Kapoor announced their second pregnancy back in April with the sweetest post. The actor shared a snapshot of little Misha Kapoor lying on the ground smiling, with a chalk doodle spelling out “big sister” beside her. “This time it's been so interesting to see how Misha has been through the entire process,” Mira had told Vogue in an interview. “She knows there is a baby inside and she says, ‘Hi Baby!' every day to my tummy.” 
Mira had recently spoken about her pregnancy with Vogue, and gave us many details on what her second experience has been like. “I think I knew I was pregnant right from when I noticed the ‘glow'. So not very far into my first trimester,” the new mom revealed. “When you have a baby, suddenly and almost immediately, your entire focus shifts to the new life you have brought into this world. [Your baby] is entirely dependent on you and you alone.” She also spoke about the importance of eating right while expecting, saying, “Everything we are given to eat, despite sounding ‘fattening' or ‘outdated' are all given to us for a reason; to regain our strength and to maintain it so we can feed and look after the baby. The ghee, milk, pinjiri and halwa helps nourish the new mother's skin and body, and bring the glow back from within. Care for yourself from the inside and it will show on the outside.” 
The newest addition of the Kapoor family may have only just arrived, but #Shamira fans are already waiting with bated breath for a first look at the duo's son. Given that Misha Kapoor's name is a mix of the names Shahid and Mira, many are also excited to hear what name the couple have come up with for their newborn. Expect more updates here, and click here for a peek into Mira Rajput Kapoor's maternity wardrobe.

Who joined the Bachchans, Gauri Khan and Karisma Kapoor? 
After months of hard work, columnist Shweta Bachchan Nanda and designer Monisha Jaising's brainchild, clothing line MXS, is now finally ready. To celebrate its completion, the duo hosted a grand get together in Mumbai this weekend, which was attended by their closest friends and family members. It comes as no surprise that almost all of the Bachchan family was in attendance, but the guest list didn't just end there. Joining Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan at the launch were Katrina Kaif, Karisma Kapoor, Gauri Khan, Neetu Kapoor, Neha Dhupia, Karan Johar, Mehr Jesia, Nita Ambani, Athiya Shetty, Sussanne Khan and Sophie Choudry, among many others. 
In case you haven't heard all about it yet, MXS is a collaborative effort between the two old friends that aims to fill up the closets of women of all shapes, sizes and ages. What makes MXS' very first collection even more special is the muse behind it—Bachchan Nanda's daughter, Navya Naveli Nanda. Find out more about the evening now. 
To show Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Monisha Jaising their support, many guests attended the launch wearing their favourite pieces from MXS. While Katrina Kaif picked a grey T-shirt and leopard print skirt from the label, Gauri Khan walked in wearing sequin-work MXS trousers and Navya Naveli Nanda played host alongside her mother and Jaising in a strapless silver creation that is now available online. Abhishek Bachchan picked MXS' ‘Girl Power' hoodie for his night out, a separate that we've also seen Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan favouring in the recent past. 
Among the stars who didn't wear MXS for the evening, some of the most talked-about OOTDs included Karisma Kapoor's shimmering black Balmain blazer, mom-to-be Neha Dhupia's polka dotted Naushad Ali maxi and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's multicoloured Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla dress. 
Given that Navya Naveli Nanda was the muse for MXS' very first campaign, it comes as no surprise that her friends dropped by for the celebratory night too. Just like Nanda, her guests were seen posing for the cameras with their mothers. While Suhana Khan walked in with Gauri Khan, dressed in an off-shoulder MXS blouse embellished with silver stars, Alanna Panday twinned with mom Deanne Panday in ivory, Shanaya Kapoor accompanied Maheep Kapoor on the black carpet, and both Isha Ambani and Nita Ambani looked elegant in breezy separates.

Neon trucks, horses and teeth 
Even if you don't keep up with the Kardashians, we're pretty certain you stumbled across an internet picture of Kim Kardashian West driving a neon Mercedes truck (costing about Rs 1.8 crore) in Miami a week ago. And it looks like Kanye liked the way his wife looked with it. According to the reality star's Insta-stories, her rapper husband had the exact same truck waiting in her front yard a few days after she got home, because he knew how much she loved driving it around Miami. She's even gone on to claim that it was the truck of her dreams on the social media channel. 
But she's certainly not the first celebrity to be lavished with an exorbitant present like her recent one. Stars usually have larger budgets than mere mortals, and they tend to splurge on their better halves. From expensive cars to statement-making jewellery pieces, there's a lot that has exchanged hands in the celebrity social circuit. We listed down all the other incredible and somewhat bizarre gifts that stars have given each other, or to their loved ones. 
David and Victoria Beckham, gave each of their mothers an Audi, as to thank them for babysitting the kids while they were on tour. 
Katy Perry surprised former husband Russell Brand with a seat aboard Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic space ship. Passengers on this plane have the chance to experience anti-gravity for five minutes before re-entering Earth's atmosphere. Perry purchased tickets for both herself and Brand, so they could celebrate his 35th birthday together. However the couple split shortly after their marriage, and never got to experience her birthday gift. 
Jamie Foxx bought Robert Downey Jr two horses after a visit to his family ranch in Malibu. Foxx was apparently appalled that the stables were empty, and decided to be the one to fill them up. Downey Jr was so touched by the gesture that he gifted his Vintage El Camino to Foxx (yes, it's the same one from the Iron Man movie). 
Angelina Jolie purchased a heart-shaped island 50 miles off the coast of New York City for ex-husband Brad Pitt as a 50th birthday present. The 11-acre Petra island comes equipped with a helipad, and two homes designed by renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. 
Another one of Kanye West's outrageous gifts to Kim K was for their wedding. He gifted her 10 Burger King franchises all around Europe. 
When they were engaged, Scarlett Johansson gifted Ryan Reynolds one of her wisdom teeth... dipped in gold... on a necklace. Enough said.

The runway was lit up with stars this season 
No season of Lakmé Fashion Week is complete without a few Bollywood faces showing up on the runway, and 2018's winter/festive edition saw more than just a handful of celebrities playing showstopper in Mumbai. From LFW regulars like Kareena Kapoor Khan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Sophie Choudry to newer faces including Disha Patani and Kriti Kharbanda, everyone took to the ramp over the past five days. While some Bollywood favourites closed shows in elegant lehengas, others were seen in Western silhouettes, and all sported unmissable beauty looks. Here's a quick recap of everything you missed. 
2018 has been a year of many firsts for Janhvi Kapoor. After making her Vogue cover debut in June, the actor's first film Dhadak hit theatres in July, and she walked the Vogue Beauty Awards red carpet for the first time the very same month. On August 24, the budding star made her runway debut for Nachiket Barve's collection in a pink and blue lehenga embroidered with blooms. “When I saw the lehenga, I thought it would be really heavy and I got really nervous because I didn't know how I would walk in it,” she confessed to us after the show at St Regis. “But now that I'm wearing it, it's so light, it's so comfy.” 
Just a day before Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi walked the runway as showstoppers at Lakmé Fashion Week winter/festive 2018, they shared some very big news on their Instagram pages: the couple are expecting their first child. For their very first public appearance post the announcement, the couple closed Payal Singhal's show, titled ‘Show Stopping Bride' in matching Indian ethnic looks in shades of ivory and peach. If you're a mom-to-be with a wedding coming up, you can't miss Dhupia's look on the runway. 
This season of Lakmé Fashion Week was brimming with wedding wear inspiration for both brides and her bridesmaids. While Aditi Rao Hydari, Diana Penty and Dia Mirza walked the runway in pastel lehengas (seen at Jayanti Reddy, Disha Patil and Sammohi by Moksha & Hiral), Karisma Kapoor walked for Arpita Mehta in an ebony sari, Malaika Arora lit up the runway for Anushree Reddy in a green sangeet-appropriate ensemble and Bipasha Basu closed for Ruceru in a textured lehenga. 
While some showstoppers went traditional this season, others were seen in Western silhouettes. Lakmé Fashion Week winter/festive 2018 ended on August 26 with Kareena Kapoor Khan walking for Monisha Jaising's grand finale (are you bold enough to try her iridescent cut-out maxi?), and before that, Kangana Ranaut walked for Pankaj & Nidhi in an embellished number, Disha Patani joined Shahid Kapoor at Amit Aggarwal's show in a slinky black dress and Jacqueline Fernandez walked Ashish N Soni's ramp twice in two very interesting looks.

Check out how Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, the Johar twins and more celebrated 
Raksha Bandhan gives us all an occasion to celebrate our first ever partners-in-crime, our siblings and cousins, and as always, Bollywood celebrities were not far behind on the festivities. Many of your favourite stars were spotted taking time out from their hectic schedules to meet their siblings on Sunday, and of course, spread some of the love on social media too. From Janhvi Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Anushka Sharma to Taimur Ali Khan and Yash and Roohi Johar, everyone from tinsel town was spotted bonding with their loved ones yesterday. 
The youngest nawab of the Pataudi family celebrated his first rakhi with his many cousins and siblings, and as is norm with the celebrity kid, made waves on the internet with the images that came out from the celebrations. It looks like he had two separate places to be this Raksha Bandhan—he was spotted celebrating with Inaaya Naumi Kemmu, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan at Soha Ali Khan Pataudi's house, and then at Karisma Kapoor's, with cousins Samiera and Kian Raj Kapoor. Taimur matched his cousins in Indian wear, with slicked back hair and two adorable tiny kurta sets for his two social commitments, while Inaaya sported a salwar kurta too, with a matching dupatta pinned in place. 
Karan Johar's twins Yash Johar and Roohi Johar, who just turned a year old earlier this year, celebrated the occasion with the close friends and family members. Joining in the celebrations was Alia Bhatt, who came by to tie a rakhi to little Yash. It is common knowledge that Karan Johar considers Bhatt to be his first child, and so, some Raksha Bandhan revelry was definitely on the cards. 
It was a full house at the Kapoor residence yesterday, as everyone from Janhvi Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor got together for the special occasion. The two actors were joined by siblings Khushi Kapoor and Anshula Kapoor, along with cousins and Sanjay Kapoor's children, Shanaya and Jahaan. Though Sonam K Ahuja and Rhea Kapoor were missing from the festivities, we spotted their brother Harshvardhan Kapoor also making a rare appearance in the family photos. Ahuja did take to Instagram to share a memorable picture from her wedding celebrations though, to show her love for her brothers. 
Scroll on to take a look at all the pictures Bollywood celebrities shared from their Raksha Bandhan celebrations.

Congratulations to the soon-to-be parents! 
Just like their wedding in May this year, which came as a complete surprise to fans everywhere, Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi have just led us to yet another revelation—Neha Dhupia is pregnant. The actor just announced the news on her Instagram profile a few minutes ago with a series post of four photographs of the couple caressing Dhupia's baby belly, and a succinct caption, reading, “Here's to new beginnings ... #3ofUs .... 🤰👼#satnamwaheguruੴ”. Clicked in black and white and sepia tones, the couple looks ever so delighted to be finally sharing the news with everyone in the pictures. Earlier this month, the two were spotted holidaying in Maldives as well, which we now realise was a babymoon. 
The couple had announced their wedding with Instagram posts too, and even that news was kept under wraps from everybody, including their industry friends. They tied the knot in a traditional Anand Karaj ceremony in Delhi three months ago, and Dhupia was a beautiful bride in a baby pink Anita Dongre lehenga embroidered in the shades of matching coral pink and mint green. 
Her ensemble was complemented well by the groom's look for the day—a white sherwani worn with a pale pink turban, a hot pink crushed dupatta and a matching pocket square. We last spotted the couple at the Vogue Beauty Awards 2018, for which Dhupia was a part of the judging panel. Scroll onwards for a look at pictures from the couple's pregnancy announcement.

The model talks to Vogue India about what he's looking forward to in India, first impressions, and the thing he can't forget to buy for his girlfriend 
Think about a cross between an Abercrombie model and a Greek god, and your brain will probably come up with a visual image resembling Nick Bateman. ICYMI, the Canadian IMG model recently flew in to Mumbai for Lakmé Fashion Week winter/festive 2018, and his presence was arguably one of the biggest highlights of Day 1. Rated as one of the most handsome men in the world, Bateman is no stranger to having fans swoon. He is an actor, a model, a martial arts pro and a veritable Instagram star, with an incredible 6.7 million followers on the social media channel at the time of this article going live; and last evening, he took over Vogue India's Instagram stories to share his evening in Mumbai directly with his fans. 
Bateman arrived in India on August 21, and had a meet-and-greet slotted with his fans at Palladium, Lower Parel yesterday. In the country to introduce his clothing line, DTLA, at Lakmé Fashion Week winter/festive 2018, we got the busy star to sit down with us for a quick chat to get all the details of his trip here. 
Yes, it is my first time in India. I landed in Mumbai at about 4 or 3am about a day ago, and the experience has been great. There were 50-plus people waiting at the airport for me, and they greeted me with gifts, hugs and photos. One thing I noticed how hot and humid it is, so [the climate] was kind of hard to get used to. I'm originally from Canada and then Los Angeles, and we have dry heat in LA, which makes it a little more bearable. But it's definitely been cool seeing the culture here and the diversity. 
I would say if that's your main occupation—when that was my main occupation—[the best part was] travelling and the people you meet. You get to travel all over the world and many times you have to do it alone, and it can get lonely, but I think being able to travel the world and see different places is probably the best perk of being a model. 
The worst? (smiles) It could be travelling to a 100 places where you don't want to go. So you will have to get on a plane completely by yourself and travel for hours, and go to a job where you've got a 100 sets of clothes to wear... there are ups and downs, and I'm lucky that I don't have to do the downs anymore. 
About a week ago, I asked my followers and fans where they would like us to bring the brand next and, with the resounding amount of people [who responded], we were told that India probably got the most votes, and funny enough I was travelling to India a week later. The brand's called DTLA [for] Downtown LA [since] we started there, and we are looking to bring it to other parts of the world, [for people who want] the LA lifestyle in India or Mexico or Brazil. 
It's been good so far. I haven't been able to see a fashion show yet, but I'm going to be seeing one at 9.30 tonight. I was able to get backstage to see one of the designers setting up for fittings, and it looked different than what I'm used to, but it's nice to see the different culture and the designs based on Indian designers' thoughts and vibes. 
I've just really enjoyed my trip because of the people. I've had such support being here and I have a good team that's here with me and I've been able to have fun with them. I'm still experiencing India as a country because the rains have been kind of hard to manoeuvre around, but I'm going to do more sightseeing and I'm very excited to get to actually see what Mumbai and India are all about, other than the rain and traffic. 
Yeah, huge fan of Indian food; it's one of my favourites, one of my go-tos. Indian and Thai are two of my favourite foods. Since I've been here, I've been ordering room service nonstop. 
Well, tonight I want to go out and see Indian nightlife. Also, I just want to go out where it's not as crazy busy. I'd like to go see maybe a bit of the outskirts of the city. Mainly, it's the people why I wanted to come here. I wanted to meet the people and experience the culture in that way. 
I have quite a random, diverse playlist. I listen to everything except for country music. I've recently added a couple of old Green Day songs from when I was super young. I'm a huge throwback person. I added a couple 50 Cent songs like “What Up Gangtsa” and “In Da Club”.  I like another band called Explosions In The Sky—it's all just instrumental, no lyrics or anything, but it's good for long flights if you want to relax. I'm a huge fan of movie scores, so like Kingsman's Secret Service, 007...I literally like to add a soundtrack to my life. So if I land at an airport, the first thing I do is I put James Bond on, and all my friends are laughing at me, like "what are you doing?". But I just love playing a soundtrack to my life. 
You know about "Jai Ho"? I have that song in my phone. Hopefully if I go out tonight, I'll request Hindi music from the DJ instead of like these 50 Cent songs. 
Sounds mean, but I'd say leave India. I say this to all my friends; I grew up in Toronto and there is a bubble in Toronto. My advice would be to conquer Mumbai and do everything you can to get to the top in Mumbai. Once you reach that and you can see that you need to grow more, try move to New York or LA and to the next step. But don't do it too fast either. Don't just leave until you haven't got the right contacts there, or have put in the work and done the jobs here. With any kind of fashion, you have to pay your dues, unfortunately. Work hard, meet the right people, be professional and work your way up the ladder. And when you're ready, go to bigger markets. 
I want to go to Brazil. I've never been to Brazil. I would like to go to Colombia. I've always wanted to go to Japan. The martial arts that I have a black belt in is from Japan, and it'd be just nice to see the origin country of the thing that I spent 20 years of my life training for. 
Oh yeah, for sure. One thing that I have to mandatorily do for my girlfriend (former Irish politician Maria Corrigan) is to pick up a magnet, like a fridge magnet, everywhere I go. We collect those, and if I don't get a magnet, I'm dead. It's mandatory.

Shweta Bachchan Nanda shares a peek 
Amitabh Bachchan and wife Jaya Bachchan are no strangers to the shutterbugs, whether they are in India or visiting someplace overseas. However, the power couple's only daughter, Shweta Bachchan Nanda, has kept to herself over the years. Always poised, perfectly put-together and polite to a fault, soft-spoken Bachchan Nanda's reclusive nature has built an air of mystery around her. As a result, any and every glimpse of the columnist sparks interest among Bollywood enthusiasts around the globe. 
With the launch of her collaborative clothing line with Monisha Jaising, it looks like Bachchan Nanda is also opening herself up to the world. Earlier this week, she made her Instagram account public, and the number of her social media followers has been growing by the minute ever since. Full of throwback shots, happy family photos and witty captions, this is one account you must follow if you're a Bachchan fan. Here's a quick peek at some of our favourite posts. 
“I'm the baby of the family, my sister got married years ago and she is fiercely protective of me,” Abhishek Bachchan once revealed to Vogue, and Shweta Bachchan Nanda's collection of childhood pictures back the statement up. Scroll through her Insta page and you'll spot some unseen snapshots of her and Abhishek looking adorable in the '70s. One of the cutest of the lot includes a picture of the siblings having a blast in matching pyjamas. Bachchan Nanda captioned it saying, “G, if we've survived matching printed PJ's we can get through anything… all we got to do is hold each other's hand… tight (and maybe don't pinch me so hard all the time!)” Her feed is also full of more recent pictures with Abhishek Bachchan, proving that some bonds only get stronger with time. 
A big part of Shweta Bachchan Nanda's Instagram feed is dedicated to her travels around the globe. From pictures of mother Jaya Bachchan soaking up some sun in Seychelles to snapshots of her family enjoying mehandi celebrations at a destination wedding, you'll find it all in her feed—and it's enough to inspire you to make a trip to the Maldives too (the islands are one of the Bachchan family's favourite vacay spots). 
Like most moms, Shweta Bachchan Nanda loves sharing photographs of her kids on her page. Some of her proudest moments as a parent include Navya Naveli Nanda's prom, and the day her son Agastya Nanda became captain of his team. Her feed also includes some adorable snapshots of her children spending quality time with their grandparents. 
The littlest of Amitabh Bachchan's grandchildren too has a special spot in Bachchan Nanda's Insta feed. When Aaradhya Bachchan isn't busy hanging out with her aunt at the beach (“I adore this kid,” Bachchan Nanda says in a caption. “Little A and Bua know it's all about sandy toes and flowers in your hair), you'll see pictures of her making Sr Bachchan chase her through their backyard. 
And that's not where it ends. Along with family, Bachchan Nanda's Instagrams also include some unmissable snapshots with her closest friends including Gauri Khan, Karan Johar and Prabal Gurung. What's life like in her shoes? Find out now via our slideshow, and don't miss reading her captions there too.

Bold metallics and sheers 
The 2018 Video Music Awards saw the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B and Ariana Grande descend on New York City's Radio City Music Hall for music's boldest red carpet. Honouring the best in music videos from the past year, the awards have typically been one of the most outrageous red carpets, and inside is no different. Remember that Madonna and Britney kiss, anyone? How about Miley Cyrus's twerking? This year, performers included Ariana Grande, Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, Shawn Mendes, Aerosmith, Post Malone and Panic! At The Disco. Jennifer Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for lifetime achievement, an honour which was awarded to Pink in 2017, and Rihanna in 2016. On the carpet, choices were bold, bold and bolder—with Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson making their first official red carpet appearance together. See our favourite red carpet looks below.

Did you miss this? 
After staying mum about it for about a year, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas finally put all rumours of their romance to rest in one of the most efficient ways we've seen yet—they got engaged. It's clear that privacy is on top of this couple's priority list, and their intimate roka ceremony last week, and the quiet house party that followed the same night, stands testament to that. Skipping on all the paparazzi shots and public interviews, the two decided to celebrate their engagement by sharing their joy with only the people who matter most to them. After spending their special day with close friends and family, the two were spotted visiting an orphanage in Mumbai yesterday. 
On Sunday morning, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas headed to visit St Catherine's Home for Girls in Andheri, Mumbai, with their loved ones. The girls at the orphanage were obviously more than excited, and it looks like they even got a dance lesson from Chopra. Yesterday, Jonas posted a sweet Insta story of his new fiancée shaking a leg on stage with one of the girls, with a succinct caption, “St. Catherine's orphanage today. My heart is full”. 
The couple were accompanied by Nick's parents, Paul Kevin and Denise Jonas, Chopra's family, and her close friend Anusha Dandekar as well. Another video from the couple's day out was a short clip of Jonas singing to the girls. Chopra's caption explained her association with the orphanage—looks like she's been coming here for the past 12 years. Her girls at the orphanage seem to be as enthralled by her new fiance as she is. “12 years of knowing these girls and they get all love struck by the #lovebug... thank you @nickjonas and our families. Thank you to the sisters and all the girls at St. Catherine's orphanage for opening your hearts to us again. I'll see you next time,” she wrote. Nick Jonas reportedly left for the US with his family soon after this trip. 
Here's all that you missed from Priyanka Chopra's and Nick Jonas' last outing together in Mumbai. Scroll on for all the pictures and videos.

All details in here 
Ever since Priyanka Chopra was first spotted with Nick Jonas at the 2017 Met Gala, fans have been keeping a close eye on their every move. From attending family weddings together in Atlantic City to double dates in London with Jonas' brother Joe and his fiancee Sophie Turner, to now actually planning their own wedding, it's been a whirlwind romance for the celebrity couple. 
This morning, when pictures of the Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' intimate roka ceremony started circulating the internet, fans were on the edge of their seats for a grand celebration. But it looks like the couple has skipped a lavish party in favour of a more private event with some of their closest friends. In case you had decided to live like a digital hermit today, let us catch you up on all the updates you missed. 
One of the first picture from the night was that of Parineeti Chopra, who stepped out in sharp winged eye and a short, full-sleeved black dress, complete with multicoloured tassels. Alia Bhatt too chose a black dress, a longer iteration embellished with patterns of celestial bodies. Mother Madhu Chopra chose to go down the sari route for her daughter's celebrations. 
The first time we saw Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas together at a public celebration was at Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's pre-engagement sangeet party. It is no secret that the actor is close to Isha Ambani, so it came as no surprise that the Ambanis would be one of the first to arrive. The Ambani women chose blush pink as their colour for the night—Nita Ambani chose a pastel salwar kurta set with a thick gold border, while Isha picked a floral gown in the same hue. 
By way of her being a part of Bollywood for nearly two decades now, it is only expected that her guest list would be as star-studded as it can be. We spotted Alia Bhatt entering the party, and many more stars are expected to make an appearance for what looks like an all-night soiree. Along with cousin Parineeti Chopra and close friend Arpita Khan Sharma, we also saw Aayush Sharma, Siddharth Roy Kapur and Anusha Dandekar at the celebrations.

After months of speculation, actor Priyanka Chopra and musician Nick Jonas finally made their betrothal official in the cutest way 
Newswires have been buzzing since earlier this week, when Nick Jonas arrived with his parents to meet Priyanka Chopra and her family, and after the romantic proposal and the ring-spotting, speculation was rife that the two are going to make their engagement official with a traditional ceremony. A few pictures surfaced earlier today of the two doing a puja in the presence of their family, apparently during their roka. And finally it looks like the two are ready to open up about their much-talked about relationship to the world—the couple took to Instagram to post an adorable photograph of them together after the ceremony, with the sweetest captions. 
While Chopra's caption said "Taken.. With all my heart and soul.." Jonas posted the same picture with an equally sweet message for Priyanka: "Future Mrs. Jonas. My heart. My love." 
While a more lavish party is expected to take place at Mumbai's JW Marriott in Juhu tonight—with a guest list likely studded with Bollywood celebrities—the roka was an intimate affair at home with only the family's closest friends. Priyanka Chopra was seen in a sorbet yellow kurta-sharara set with chikankari work all over, while Nick Jonas wore a simple white silk kurta and churidar. Chopra's cousin Parineeti Chopra and friend Arpita Khan Sharma were among the few seen arriving at the venue for this morning's event. Paparazzi cameras also spotted gold-and-white beribboned boxes, which seemed to be gifts for the guests attending. 
From what we've seen so far, it's going to be a traditional ceremony for the celebrity couple. “Priyanka wants everything to be traditional to respect her family's values, and definitely an Indian wedding,” a source revealed to E! recently. “Priyanka and Nick are excited for everyone to meet and to celebrate. All of the plans are moving quickly." The source also let on that the wedding will probably follow soon, since Chopra and Jonas "do not want to have a long engagement".

It’s getting real, people 
It's been a while since news of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' relationship first hit the internet, but the world's curiosity for the power couple hasn't died down with time. Whether the duo are cycling through the Big Apple in matching outfits, enjoying an intimate dinner date or partying with Bollywood's cool crew at the Ambani residence, Chopra and Jonas always manage to top trending charts these days. And now, if rumours are to be believed, the couple are taking their relationship to the next level. Before Chopra says “I do”, she is reportedly celebrating her engagement with the musician in Mumbai, and here's everything you need to know about it. 
Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra made their first appearance as a couple in Mumbai this June at Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani's engagement ceremony. Right before the Ambanis' big night, Jonas was also seen spending time with Chopra's family and friends at a mini vacation in Goa. “We're getting to know each other and I think it was a great experience for him,” Chopra had revealed some time ago. “That's what he said. I think he really enjoyed it. It was really beautiful. He had a great time.” 
After that eventful India trip, Jonas has touched down in Mumbai again last night and this time, he's brought his family with him. He arrived in the city on August 16 with parents Denise and Paul Kevin Jonas, and rumour has it Chopra came to the airport to greet her beau. 
When two stars come together, one can expect the wedding celebrations to take over the world (or at the very least, your social media feeds). Keeping that in mind, it's safe to say Chopra and Jonas' Mumbai engagement will be a memorable one. The celebration is rumoured to take place on August 18, and the bride-to-be has got fans all over the world wondering which designer she'll be wearing for the occasion. 
“Priyanka wants everything to be traditional to respect her family's values, and definitely an Indian wedding,” a source revealed to E! recently. “Priyanka and Nick are excited for everyone to meet and to celebrate. Everything is very secretive but guests are expected to head there starting tomorrow. All of the plans are moving quickly and Priyanka and Nick do not want to have a long engagement.” 
Things seem to be moving very quickly for Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas. Just months into their much-talked-about relationship, Jonas reportedly proposed to Chopra while the couple were in London for her 36th birthday. The 25-year-old singer pulled a Sweet Home Alabama on her by having a Tiffany & Co store closed down just for the two of them, giving Chopra a chance to pick out her engagement ring in privacy. Reports reveal that sources close to Jonas say he's “very, very happy... His friends and family have never seen him like this, and they're all really excited for him. He's definitely very serious about her.” 
Since the proposal, Chopra has stepped down from her latest Bollywood project. Thanks to a recent picture posted by Raveena Tandon, the couple's fans also got a peek at what many believe is The Ring. 
  
Before they made things official, Chopra and Jonas stepped out for several occasions together this year. Their most memorable public appearances include the time they were seen hanging out on Memorial Day, and the time they caught a Beauty and the Beast Live concert together. The couple seems pretty comfortable being shot by paparazzi, and are not holding back on the Instagram PDA either. Chopra was seen on Jonas' arm as his date for a wedding in the singer's family, where she probably met his parents too. The couple first caught the world's attention when they attended 2017's Met Gala together. 
Can't wait for more on Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas? Stay tuned for all the updates from the couple's engagement ceremony.

All the highlights from the starry night 
Apart from being a popular designer, costume stylist and social media influencer in India, Manish Malhotra is also known for throwing some of Bollywood's most star-studded parties. The designer showcased his prowess at merrymaking with a soiree at his residence on August 14, which had everyone from Karan Johar and Priyanka Chopra to Janhvi Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan in attendance. Read on for everything you missed from the star-studded night. 
In case you missed all the updates on Instagram, Karan Johar, Priyanka Chopra and Raveena Tandon were all seen at the lavish evening, and the guest list also included younger actors like Dhadak co-stars Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter, as well as Tara Sutaria, Ananya Panday and Tiger Shroff from the cast of Student of the Year 2. 
Other familiar faces spotted at the party were Kiara Advani, Khushi Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor, Kajol, Diana Penty, Kriti Kharbanda, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sonakshi Sinha, Karishma Kapoor, Neha Dhupia, Angad Bedi, Athiya Shetty, Puneet Malhotra, Pooja Hegde, Nushrat Bharucha, Bhumi Pednekar, Rhea Chakraborty, Anushka Ranjan, Vicky Kaushal, Iulia Vantur and Yami Gautam. 
The internet was taken by storm by one particular image that came out of this party. Raveena Tandon posted a selfie with Priyanka Chopra from the night, where a stunning diamond engagement ring could be clearly seen on her left ring finger. Chopra was also seen posing with Sophie Choudry, Karan Johar and others at the bash, and the ring was very evident in their pictures together too. 
Considering all the rumours flying around about the multi-hyphenate's engagement to beau Nick Jonas, this one got fans all over the world excited. Jonas reportedly proposed to Chopra on her 36th birthday last month, and shut down a Tiffany store to buy a ring for her that is rumoured to be valued at $2,00,000. 
The celebrity designer also took the opportunity to welcome Sara Ali Khan to the world of Instagram at his recent party. The young actor only seems to have one post up right now, but with two upcoming movies on her schedule, we can expect her feed to soon be filled with a slew of promotional outfits and posts that give fans an insight into her covetable life.

And her secret to being a good actor 
Alia Bhatt is running behind schedule, but the minute she emerges from her suite, you're instantly aware of being in the presence of a star who is doing that thing celebrities do to make sure you feel the wait was worth it. We are at the JW Marriott Juhu, where Bhatt will soon be walking down the runway, displaying her collection for Caprese. Slightly goofy, radiant and talking a mile a minute, it hits you at 25, she is already one of the industry's finest actors and will only grow to be a bigger star than she is. 
Bhatt's association with Caprese as their brand ambassador has been ongoing for nearly three years. This season, she has co-created handbags with the design team that are a blend of her own tastes, and draw inspiration from the Mediterranean island of Capri. “The idea behind the curation was that it should have my style, which is basically kind of minimal, lots of colours and a few florals here and there. But we [also] wanted to offer variety,” she explains earnestly. Vogue spoke to Alia Bhatt about being a bag lady, finally working with Ranbir Kapoor, and what it takes to be an actor. 
I'm somebody who travels a lot. So essentially for me, what I look for is the comfort element, but at the same time, it is also about the look. You have to have that balance off that correct colour, the correct pop. A bright backpack or like a bright tote could be an essential of mine. 
Honestly, I have everything in my bag. If you were stranded for three days [with me] you would be fine, but [there's] nothing really surprising [in there]. I'm obsessed with skin and lip hydration, so you would find different lip hydrators and face hydrators. 
Yeah, of course! You are either a bag person or a shoe person I think, [and] I'm most definitely a bag person. 
I don't count because that would make me feel a little embarrassed. But I can say that one closet is sort of overflowing now, and I need another—which I don't have. 
What I like about Caprese is that they manage functional and chic at the same time. They are very progressive in their style and they are constantly adapting. The bags are suitable for any sort of occasion—you have a variety of bags that you can take to brunch, to a dinner date [or] you can take when you are travelling somewhere. So from laptop bags to backpacks, totes to satchels, we have it all. 
I could tell you lots about my character if I was allowed, but I'm not. The film is slated to release next year. I can say for sure that it is something that Indian cinema has not seen on celluloid before. We are putting out a one-of-its-kind experience. 
It's been amazing. Honestly, working with Ranbir is something that I have always looked forward to, because I have looked up to him so much as an actor. If he is a fantastic actor, [and] he is an even more fantastic human being to work [with]. When you are on set, you become like a family and everyone really looks after one another. Everybody is really into each other's work and that's the way it is. It becomes like a family working towards one big goal, and its really nice when your co-actor is very understanding and accommodating and is just, you know, like an easy delight. Ranbir is that. 
Amitji is a legend. It's been absolutely fantastic to be work with him—he is so, so, professional. Even now, when we are all on set and even though we are done, we will all come and see him perform on the monitor. It's an opportunity that not everyone gets, to be with him live on location, and his character is [also] super cool. I'm really looking forward to the release. 
There is a lot of love for what I do and that keeps me going. If I didn't love what I was doing, I don't know how I would continue. I have no complaints. If someone says you're so busy, I just keep knocking on wood because it's a good thing. 
This is a secret and I'm giving it away—I think understanding humans is very important to understand the character that you are portraying. If you don't have a sense of humankind and you don't get a perspective immediately, then you won't have the ability to dig deep in the relationship, and you can forget about being a star. What it takes to be an actor is to be an understanding human being. 
Punctuality and punctuality and respect and respect. The two things they taught me the most is respect for time and respect for people. My motto in life is to constantly be on time and appreciate everyone's contribution. It's very easy for you to start floating in the air when you're an actor. Those are the two things that both of them have taught me together. 
Every role is challenging. Right now, I can say the roles I am playing in Brahmastra and Kalank are the most challenging ones I have ever portrayed.

With Navya Naveli Nanda playing muse for the collaboration 
What happens when two old friends join forces? Ask Monisha Jaising and Shweta Bachchan Nanda. The two collaborated on a custom look for the latter for a friend's birthday recently, and the success of the look was such that duo decided to give their alliance a real shot—and thus the label MXS was born, of a chance encounter. The new brand has a simple aim: to solve wardrobe woes for women of all sizes and ages. For their debut campaign, they enlisted Navya Naveli Nanda, who stars alongside her mother in it. “Navya is our muse,” Bachchan Nanda tells us. “But it's not only for young girls, it's also for slightly mature girls.” 
The timing could not be more apt—Jaising happens to be closing the upcoming season of Lakmé Fashion Week. Despite her obvious expertise in the field of design, she is humble enough to share the credit with her co-collaborator. “When you look at Shweta you think of her as a clotheshorse. But you would be surprised! If you sat in one of our workshops you would think it was only me doing the design—no way. She has a mind of her own,” says Jaising, in high praises for Bachchan Nanda's sartorial acumen. Navya Naveli Nanda also tells us that her sense of style comes from her mother. “She always tells me less is more. I haven't had to give any inputs in the debut collection. I love it and would definitely wear these pieces once they are out,” she says. The collection caters to a wide audience ranging from 18 year olds to 60 somethings, offers sizes from XS and XXL, and will have 50 styles coming out for each of the four seasons in a year. 
Bachchan Nanda places the aesthetic of MXS somewhere between glam, baroque and street fashion. “A lot of my working friends tell me that they can't find clothes to go from work to a party that are immediately available, that don't need to be ordered online, that are not crazy expensive, and we are trying to offer that with the label,” she signs off. 
MXS will be available online and in Monisha Jaising stores from September 1

Bride-to-be, take notes 
Over the past few months, all eyes have been on Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas. The celebrity couple were first seen together on the Met Gala 2017 red carpet, and over time, their public appearances together only became more frequent. The duo has been spotted cycling through the streets of New York together, spending quality time with Chopra's family in Goa, and also celebrating Akash Ambani's engagement with Shloka Mehta in Mumbai. But what's had fans all over the globe buzzing with excitement lately are the rumours surrounding Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas's engagement. 
We still don't have an official statement, but it looks like the rumours are true, and a gorgeous engagement ring serves as proof. After two months of dating officially, Jonas is said to have closed down a Tiffany & Co store for Chopra so she could pick her dream ring in private. And the world got a first look at the bride-to-be's new ring via Bollywood actor Raveena Tandon's Instagram feed. The star recently shared pictures of herself hanging out with Chopra, captioned "PeeCee and I getting our pouts in order!" Look closely and you'll see a stunning solitaire ring on Priyanka Chopra's left ring finger. If you're a fan of diamonds, you won't be able to look away easily. The ring looks like it features a cushion cut diamond in the centre, flanked by tapered baguettes. 
Recently, Nick Jonas made news when he gave away the status of his relationship with Chopra when a fan congratulated him on his engagement and he responded with a "Thanks man." Until we wait for more details on the couple's big day (spoiler: you may soon see Nick Jonas and his brothers in Mumbai for an official engagement celebration very soon). Take a closer look at some of their best moments together till date:

Just in time for the festive season 
From sharing real estate with half a grocery store for her debut boutique to becoming one of the most prominent textile revivalists in the country, designer Ritu Kumar's career trajectory has only leaped from strength to strength over the course of the past five decades. With the festive season around the corner, the news only gets better: The designer is now making her first foray into the world of jewellery with a new collaboration with Rhea Jewellery, a Mumbai-based label. 
The need to provide the everyday woman with a complete styling solution served as the driving thought behind the new offering; “Innovation lies at the heart of our label. We wanted to check off all boxes while creating a look for the Label Ritu Kumar woman. In the past, we've worked on scarves, bottoms, belts and sling bags, keeping in mind the versatility that women now demand of their daily wardrobes. The same ideology extends to this new collaboration—a line of bold, eye-catching jewellery felt like the most natural way forward,” says her son and CEO, Amrish Kumar. 
Using the label's autumn/winter '18 collection as the canvas, the collection serves up a complementary range of accessories—expect everything from subtle fine jewellery for everyday use, to showstopper earrings and tiered necklaces. “When designing a new collection, it always comes down to two elements: material and mood,” says Rima Jain, founder of Rhea Jewellery. “I've always been passionate about bold stones and crystals, especially how they catch the eye and evoke a sense of sparkle, both in the literal and figurative sense,” she adds. 
Likewise, you'll find a host of unconventional materials working their way into the construction of the pieces, with rope, nylon and sturdy metals juxtaposing the feminine pearls and turquoise stones. “The jewellery is bold and designed to make a statement. This unique combination of materials makes for a larger range, where subtle pieces for daily use find a place next to chunky, crystal-heavy pieces,” elaborates Kumar. 
If you've been struggling to keep up with the demands of an ever-packed social calendar, allow Kumar's handy guide for accessorising to come to your rescue: 
Formal meeting at work: Make a subtle yet powerful statement by pairing the Luna necklace from the collection with our nut bolt ring. 
Drinks with colleagues after work: Simply swap the Luna necklace with the Calypso chain necklace and leave the statement nut bolt ring on. 
Sunday brunch with the girls: Get into the groove with our marbled turquoise drops paired with the Aqua skyline necklace. 
Cocktail party: Go heavy on the crystals with the Interstellar ring teamed with our crystal clover drops.

Here’s everything we know 
If you're a fan of keeping up with the latest in all things fashion, we've got news for you—Aditi Rao Hydari is the face of Ritu Kumar's autumn/winter 2018 collection. The campaign was shot by the seaside in Alibaug, and has the actor looking reminiscent of an age of innocence, wearing dreamy kaftans and midnight-hued tunics from the label's newest line. But Rao Hydari is more than a muse for the designer. Beyond embodying the quintessential Ritu Kumar woman, who mixes modern and vintage with complete ease, Rao Hydari also shares a deeper connection with the brand. We discovered that her friendship with the Kumar family, especially the designer's son, Amrish Kumar (who is now the heritage label's CEO), goes way back in time. We sat down with the actor to talk about everything from her link with the 50-year-old label to personal style, and even favourite on-screen looks. 
I've spent days in Ritu Masi's house growing up, surrounded by Amrish, his brother and their cousins. Their home was like a museum, filled with the most amazing things. So Amrish and I have known each other for very long. He's seen me as a little girl, returning from Bharatnatyam practice with two braids in my hair. I don't think Amrish can ever take me seriously—he's always making fun of me! But I've been an actor now for almost seven years and it's only now that they've called me for this. So beyond our long-time relationship, I think why I've been called is because more and more, I'm gearing towards the kind of style that I feel is more natural to me. Working with the label felt like a natural extension of me. My love for indigenous crafts and textiles go back to my childhood, where I accompanied my aunt to local exhibitions all the time. 
Ritu Kumar has a revival instinct. They're keeping age-old embroidery styles and handicrafts alive for a generation that likes to mix old with new. In the new collection, the silhouettes are free-flowing and colours vary from ochre and deep blue. I love this one midnight velvet set that I'm also wearing in the campaign images. It's so versatile—you could wear it as a dress or as a kurta, and you could also wear it with jeans. There's another maxi with a Sanganeri, ajrakh print. Besides these highlights, it's always great to work with people you love! 
I remember when I moved to Mumbai, I would roam around in Kolhapuris or flats with jeans and T-shirts, no makeup and I was constantly told to behave like a star or be glamorous and sexy. At the time I did feel the pressure, but along the way I've managed to stick to my values and embrace the fact that this in itself can be a look! I love a desi boho vibe—something effortless and more undone. Quite often, as actors we are asked to not repeat outfits. But I feel, why shouldn't I repeat an outfit? If I like it, I'll wear it again! One of my favourite on-screen looks have been the one in Padmaavat. It was so authentic, even the linings were made from vintage Mashru fabrics. I actually felt like Mehrunissa from the 13th century.

She will be part of a commercial program that will eventually see humans travel to space 
On August 3, NASA announced the names of nine astronauts to fly the commercially developed space missions, and one of the crew members is Sunita Williams. Ever since her selection as an astronaut (1998), Williams has been twice aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and also held record for total spacewalks by a woman and most spacewalk time for a woman. 
The team will fly on a spacecraft developed by the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Crew Dragon and a global aviation firm—Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. This collaborative effort is to further commercial space flights, to launch humans into space from the US soil. 
The first un-crewed demonstration for the spacecraft will take place sometime in November 2018 and the first flight with two astronauts on board is scheduled for April 2019. Williams has been assigned to the second flight demo of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. 
Born in Ohio, Williams was previously in the Navy where she was a test pilot, and rose to the rank of captain before retiring and joining NASA. This will be the third time she embarks on a space expedition.

Get a complete look at it now 
What starts out as a simple thought for Sabyasachi Mukherjee can transform into a bride's dream outfit. No concept is ever thought of in one dimension. In the case of ‘Kesribai Pannalal', his offering for couture 2018, the designer looked at indigenous crafts that were dying due to industrialisation, and how those could be revived by generating interest in the market for them. 
Mukherjee spoke about many such fading traditional crafts before the launch of the collection on Instagram. The kiran–a metallic fringe that serves as a trim for a North Indian bride's odhani, grabbed his attention. Traditionally done in pure metal indicative of the bride's wealth, it was soon replaced by polyster imitations. The original process of crafting meenakari jewellery has also undergone metamorphosis for commercial viability, and the Patola weave of Gujarat has been given a strong prominence in the line as well. In his efforts to bring back old world glamour coupled with authentic workmanship, Mukherjee spins a tale of nostalgia and the quiet elegance of cultural clothing with his latest collection. 
Perhaps what Mukherjee is most cognisant of is that weddings tend to be grander in the northern half of the country. While there is a loyal army of customers hooked to his lehengas, Mukherjee is expanding his own body of work to include lesser explored techniques. In what is clearly a smart move, the designer has focused on traditional clothing that is worn by brides hailing from regions where weddings are an elaborate affair.

The actor recently spoke about her now six-month-old son, and why the couple decided to keep their new parenthood private 
In these digital times, posting about every new update of our lives on social media is the norm. Whether we're it is our incessant need to put up a picture of every second meal we consume on Instagram, or the fact that any progress you make in life feels incomplete until you talk about it on Facebook, it's safe to say that most of us live our lives on the Internet. This is exactly why the news of actor Gul Panag's baby boy being born almost six months ago with absolutely no one being the wiser, was a surprising update for many. Recently, Panag, 39, revealed to Mumbai Mirror that she welcomed her new son Nihal, with husband, pilot Rishi Attari, over half a year ago. When asked why she kept the birth secret, Panag said, “Rishi and I have always valued our privacy. Becoming parents is a special experience and we decided that we'd like to go through it without the distraction of public attention.” She also added that only close friends and family knew about her pregnancy. 
Like every new mother, Panag is now experiencing sleepless nights, but is loving being a new mom. “He is almost six months old and it has been a roller coaster ride! I'm charmed by his gurgles and giggles even if it is a bit of a struggle with erratic sleep and feeding schedules,” she told the daily. 
Panag has credited her cousin Simran for making the experience of being a new mother slightly easier—“[she has] been like a fairy godmother,” she told Mumbai Mirror. The Dor actor is a firm believer in having children only when one is ready, rather than giving in to societal expectations. “I think having a baby is a very significant step in life, and like marriage, you should think it through carefully before committing to it. Have children when you are ready to welcome them and can raise them happily and responsibly, not when society says you must,” she said. 
Congratulations to the new parents!

Taking you behind the scenes of the star's first solo red carpet prep 
This is year of many firsts for Janhvi Kapoor. After a film debut with Dhadak and a Vogue cover, it came as no surprise that she took home the ‘Fresh Face of the Year' title at the Vogue Beauty Awards 2018. Punctual to a fault, Kapoor arrived several hours before the ceremony to make room for a quick workout before hitting the red carpet. “I don't follow a routine, I just go with whatever my trainer asks of me,” she says. 
Post shower, Kapoor got into hair and makeup. The young actor is blessed with the luscious Kapoor hair gene. Her thick mane of jet black hair was dried before the transformation process took place. “I put a lot of food in my hair—eggs, beer, and methi. Some people also go with onion juice but methi is where I draw the line," she said. Kapoor also shared a ritual that her mother, Sridevi, would indulge the sisters in every week, "[Mom] would make our hair oil at home with dried flowers and amla, and she'd make sure she gave me and Khushi and oil massage every three days. Whatever leftover [fruit] we had from breakfast, we'd put on our face.” But when it came to doing her nails, Kapoor, like every millennial, couldn't put her phone down long enough to let them dry, and had to start all over again because she'd ruined the first coat. When asked her about her choice of nail colour, she said, “I like milky nude nail polishes over beige ones.” 
It all runs in the family with the Kapoors. For her first red carpet appearance, the Dhadak actor enlisted the help of ace celebrity stylist and cousin, Rhea Kapoor. An archival Ralph & Russo gown was flown in from London for the special occasion. The romantic sheer number, complete with feather detailing, silver beading and a cape, was a glamorous choice for the evening. 
She has no doubt which makeup product from the kit is her favourite. “My only instruction is, just dubaao [douse] me in highlighter,” she told hair and makeup artist Marianna Mukuchyan. By now, her sister Khushi Kapoor had arrived at the suite, ravenous after spending the day at school. Soon after, her older sister Anshula Kapoor joined in too. The conversation circulated around coming of age stories, awkward beauty mishaps and their varying degrees of obsession with online shopping. 
When she was nearly ready to walk the red carpet, she added the final touch of colour by way of a soft pink lipstick. “I've mixed two of my favourite lip colours... both are by Charlotte Tilbury.” She requested for a beauty spot to be added. “I actually have one but it gets hidden under all the makeup, so these days, I ask for it to be highlighted,” she shrugged. Catch her getting ready for the red carpet in the video.

And it’s one that’s very close to his heart 
Shah Rukh Khan's journey as an actor has been nothing short of inspirational. The superstar, who started out in Bollywood without any background in the industry around two decades ago, has made an irrefutable mark on Indian films with nothing but his talent and ability to win crowds over. And even though he is amongst the most celebrated actors in Bollywood today, at no point has he let his social responsibilities as a public figure slide. The actor continues to be an a major influence to his innumerable fans, not just for his work in films but humanitarian work too. Now, Shah Rukh Khan's Meer Foundation has joined hands with Vogue India and philanthropist Kulsum Shadab Wahab's Hothur Foundation, to create awareness about skin banking for acid attack survivors. 
The Hothur Foundation is aimed at uplifting of the underprivileged by providing them with basic amenities, such as quality educations, medical aid, maternity guidance, counselling and matrimonial aid for girls. The organisation believes in placing the needs of the underprivileged first. One of their projects involves skin banking, a process that allows for the donation of skin that can be used to treat victims of acid burns. Along with the Meer foundation, which provides support for the rehabilitation of acid attack victims, they are trying to give these victims of heartless acts of violence, a new lease on life. 
Beauty is more than just skin deep, and there couldn't be a better time to commemorate this than at the Vogue  Beauty Awards this year. During the annual awards ceremony, a moving video that announced this collaboration between the two initiatives was unveiled, and addressed the important issue of providing these survivors with acceptance first, above all else. “A project of this stature needs a booster rocket to propel it forward at warp speed and who better to do it than [Shah Rukh Khan]?” said Shadab during the awards ceremony of the joint venture. 
Khan, in his turn, said that he was honoured to associate himself with such a cause. “I think it is important to stand by people who have faced unfortunate events in their life. It is a way of thanking god that we can get an opportunity to stand beside them and share the love that we the more fortunate ones have had.”

Did you miss these fun moments? 
The Vogue Beauty Awards 2018 was easily the biggest party in Mumbai last night. Bandra's Taj Land's End hotel was brimming with the best from beauty, fashion and of course, Bollywood. Considering that this was the ninth edition of the marquee awards ceremony by Vogue, the guest list was bigger than ever before. In case you missed all the live action from the evening, here's a quick recap. 
Attending her very first Vogue Beauty Awards was Janhvi Kapoor. The young actor was seated next to her mother's longtime friend Manish Malhotra at the venue, and their camaraderie was apparent. Banita Sandu, a budding actor herself and a friend of Kapoor's, was also seated next to and seemed to have had a great time together. Newlyweds Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi hung out with Zaheer Khan and Sagarika Ghatge, and one of the sweetest duos at the awards ceremony, Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal, were unmissable on stage. 
While both Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif made sure to take pictures with the acid attack survivors of the Hothur Foundation, Saif Ali Khan and Sacred Games co-star Kubra Sait were spotted catching up in the middle of all the awards madness, just like Mental Hai Kya co-stars Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao. To wrap up the evening, Shah Rukh Khan revealed the August 2018 cover of Vogue India featuring his daughter, Suhana Khan. “I just want to say thank you very much for putting her in a place where the responsibility you've put on her is going to remove some of the entitlement she has because she happens to be my daughter. And Inshallah she'll work hard towards that. 
“I hope it's not taken as ‘entitled' just because she happens to be Shah Rukh Khan's daughter. I just hope it's taken as a responsibility that she has if she's being given a platform like this, a solo cover for Vogue,” he said. 
Starting from the youngest in the industry, Janhvi Kapoor made an unforgettable entrance in a white Ralph & Russo last night. Joining her was Neha Dhupia in Anamika Khanna, along with Sonakshi Sinha in Ali Younis. While Kangana Ranaut, Katrina Kaif, Dia Mirza, Yami Gautam and Raveena Tandon all opted for reds, Richa Chadha played with fun florals and Vidya Balan went traditional in a black sari. Rajkummar Rao, Saif Ali Khan and Shah Rukh Khan looked dapper in suits, as did Kartik Aaryan and Zaheer Khan.

Catch up on everything you missed 
The Vogue Beauty Awards 2018 saw the best in the beauty business come together under the same roof, along with some of Bollywood's most beautiful people. Held at Taj Land's End in Mumbai last night, the event was a celebration of all things beauty, with over 60 hardworking beauty products and 20 beauty experts and celebrities winning awards through the night. What's the one thing that comes with an awards ceremony of this calibre? Speeches worth listening to even once the night is done. From Shahrukh Khan to Katrina Kaif, here's a roundup of the best speeches from the star-studded night. 
“My biggest pain with Vogue is that they've been giving a lot of coverage to the girls in my family, not to me. They do put me up with models who are taller than me and say don't speak a word, just look sexy. ‘Uski taang pakad lo.' ‘Look sexy at her knee.' I've done all of this, I've learned a lot, these are my old friends, who feel I'm deserving of this award. More than anything else, this is their love.” 
“It's really special for me to win this because usually most messages coming home that say Most Beautiful in Vogue go to the better half. I'll take this with a lot of gratitude, I'll take it home, but I'm going to dedicate it to my little son Taimur who I really do feel is the most beautiful man of the year. It's nice to know after all these years one is still in Vogue.” 
“When we think about fitness, we think really [about] just the way it looks physically, and [that's] where vanity comes to mind, but fitness for me is also about taking care of myself. It's the one body we have, the one body we're going to have for this life anyway. It's also a way to kind of show a certain amount of discipline and it's a place where I go to, almost like a meditation where I'm out of my thoughts, the constant noise in your mind, and it's just that time for yourself. And in that time, I have [met] some amazing people who've been with me for the past few years, who have been tirelessly with me on this journey, mainly Yasmin Karachiwala at Body Image. Every day when I go there, they are so supportive. When you see the same person every day for over a decade, sometimes you can get a little bit bored of them, but they have this inspiration and excitement that we're going to do something new today. So, a big thank you to Yasmin Karachiwala and the whole Body Image team who every day are just there with me, supporting me on this journey.” 
Chadha: “Ali thank you, you're the most beautiful man I know and a constant amongst so many variables. I love you.” Fazal:“Thank you Vogue. I feel style, beauty, fashion doesn't exist without love, without loving yourself. She taught me how to love myself.” 
“Beauty isn't just about looks like we all know. Beauty is a promise that you make to yourself that no matter how far away you are from the standards of mainstream beauty, you will never fail to celebrate your uniqueness. Beauty is a commitment that you make to yourself that no matter how much people take you for granted, your loved ones, your family, your friends or the one you invest your whole life in, you will never fail to acknowledge an act of kindness directed towards you. Beauty is not a noun, it's a world of possibilities out there where every minute; every decision you make and choices you make are about how you feel. Beauty is a feeling.”

Straight from the Vogue Beauty Awards 2018 
The Vogue Beauty Awards 2018 celebrated some of the very best from the country's beauty industry and from Bollywood, which is where beauty reaches its culmination point. From Katrina Kaif and Kangana Ranaut to Saif Ali Khan, we saw everyone bringing their best face to the event yesterday. As the evening came to a close this year, we ended the celebration with a very special moment: the reveal of Vogue India's August 2018 cover. In case you haven't checked it out yet, this month marks Suhana Khan's first magazine shoot ever, and who better to share the first look with the world than our cover star's father, Shah Rukh Khan? 
After accepting his Most Beautiful Man of the Decade award last night, Shah Rukh presented Suhana's cover to all the guests at the Vogue Beauty Awards with the sweetest speech a father could make. The actor spoke not only about what life is like for celebrity kids, but also shared his hopes for Suhana in the future. In this month's cover story, the actor reveals that he wants to see his children work their way up to achieve their goals. “We have friends who are very well-meaning and think of my kids as their own, and they're all happy and keen to launch her. Like Karan [Johar]. But I keep insisting that I don't want them designed as stars, I want them to be launched when they are good enough actors.” 
Missed Shah Rukh Khan's speech from last night? Here are some edited excerpts. 
"I think star kids have their own personal issues, of course they're entitled and in today's world with social media it's nice that you're recognised, but where I come from, a middle class background, where someone has worked with some of the most beautiful and loveliest of people like Katrina [Kaif], and all the other people here present, I got this opportunity, and things went well for me. But kids are kids, children are children, changing the world. And sometimes, you need assistance of friends to give them a little more confidence, self-belief and self worth. So I want to thank Vogue for taking my little daughter and putting her on the cover of Vogue. I'm extremely thankful. 
"I hope it's not taken as ‘entitled' just because she happens to be Shah Rukh Khan's daughter. I just hope it's taken as a responsibility that she has if she's being given a platform like this, a solo cover for Vogue, which I incidentally have never gotten (I'm just going to keep pointing that out, I just have to look at [model's] knees and say ‘Oh I'm so sexy!' [In reference to his own shoot in Vogue India]). I just want to say thank you very much for putting her in a place where the responsibility you've put on her is going to remove some of the entitlement she has because she happens to be my daughter. And Inshallah she'll work hard towards that. 
"I'm very proud of women who work, like I mentioned, all the ladies here, and I hope it doesn't sound patronising. I'm inspired by women who work… all the ladies that I've worked with in the films that I've done. 53 years of age, from mother to sister to wife to daughter, and all the girls who've worked with me, it's an inspiration how hard they work, how selflessly they work and how many conditions, which perhaps are not the best for women in the world, not only in this country, how wonderfully happy they are. I never see them lose their smile, I never see them lose their temper, I never see them lose their professionalism. I think I've been gifted to be in the company of so many fantastic women. And I hope my daughter can join and be one of them. I'll be proud of her when she's proud of herself with the job she does so Inshallah she'll do well. I feel very honoured to be here, this is strange!" 
During the awards ceremony, Khan also took the time to join philanthropist Kulsum Shadab in spotlighting the Hothur Foundation, an organisation that supports acid attack survivors. “I'm sure all of us agree that a project of this stature needs a booster rocket to propel it forward at warp speed and who better to do it than [Shah Rukh Khan]?” Shadab said. Khan was part of a special video for Hothur Foundation that was also revealed at the event. Check it out below. 
Check out the Shahrukh's speech about a cause close to his heart, and his daughter's first Vogue cover at Vogue Beauty Awards now.

Don't miss a single look 
On July 31, some of Bollywood and the beauty industry's favourite faces came together at Mumbai's Taj Land's End hotel for the 2018 edition of the Vogue Beauty Awards. Each year, we at Vogue India pick a dress code for our guests and this time around, the colour palette was all fiery reds, deep blacks and shades of gold. It comes as no surprise that the star-studded guest list more than delivered when it came to stunning on the red carpet. From Janhvi Kapoor and Katrina Kaif to Kangana Ranaut, Shah Rukh Khan, Raveena Tandon and Saif Ali Khan, this year's guest list was brimming with stars dressed in their sartorial best. Missed what your favourite celebrities wore to VBA 2018? Catch up now. 
2018 so far has been a big year for Janhvi Kapoor. Not only did the budding star make her Bollywood debut this month with Dhadak, she also scored her very first Vogue India cover shoot earlier this year. For her first ever Vogue event, Kapoor pulled out all the stops on the red carpet. Her choice for Vogue Beauty Awards: an embellished white Ralph & Russo cape gown featuring feather details. The debutante wore the elegant ensemble with luminous makeup and romantic pulled back waves. 
No stranger to the Vogue Beauty Awards, Katrina Kaif attended this year's edition in a scarlet Ong Oaj Pairam robe gown featuring a risqué thigh-high slit. Another star who had heads turning this time around was Kangana Ranaut, who opted for a deep red Gaurav Gupta gown crafted in Fluid Liva Fabric and jewellery by Tanishq. Red was clearly a popular choice for the evening. While host Dia Mirza walked in wearing a fiery red gown, VBA judge Raveena Tandon shimmered in an embellished maroon Drenusha Xharra number and Yami Gautam went with a sharp red pantsuit. Going with ebony outfits, Vidya Balan went traditional in a sari, Banita Sandhu opted for a semi sheer Galia Lahav maxi. Richa Chadha picked a floral skater dress, and Sonakshi Sinha went all-out in a full-sleeved gold gown. 
Just like Bollywood's most-followed women, the men at VBA this year made it a point to stand out on the red carpet with their sartorial choices. While Shah Rukh Khan attended in a suit, Rajkummar Rao experimented with a red velvet suit, Kartik Aaryan opted for a classic black and white look and Saif Ali Khan looked dapper as ever in a double-breasted jacket. Joining them were cricketer Zaheer Khan with wife Sagarika Ghatge and Ali Fazal.

Keep up with the actor’s travel journey 
You're probably already aware that Academy-award winning actor Julianne Moore is India. The reason behind Moore's travel is that she shooting the remake of the film After The Wedding in the country. The film narrates the story of Isabel, a former actor who runs an orphanage in Kolkata. 
Moore, who has often spoken about the importance of balancing work with family time, is here with her husband Bart Freundlich. So far, she has shared images of him on what appears to be the rooftop of vintage structure and a poolside shot of a hotel. According to her updates on social media, Moore is in Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and seems to have wrapped up the shoot for the film. 
She has shared images of a quintessential Chettinad town—Rangolis, heritage structures and cows. Tamil actor Varalaxmi Sarathkumar had a fan moment with the star. She most recently visited the Sri Mahalakshmi Weaving Centre. Fascinated by the work of the weavers, Moore commented saying “I felt so lucky watching these artists at work today.”

All you need to know to catch up 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's on-screen chemistry is the stuff Bollywood dreams are made of. Movie buffs first saw the duo romance one another in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013), and since then, the co-stars have shared screen space together in Finding Fanny (2014), Bajirao Mastani (2015) and Padmaavat (2018). Not only do Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh make a killer pair in front of the cameras (remember this video from their Vogue India cover shoot?), their adorable off-screen moments have had Bollywood fans rooting for them since Day 1. Now, rumours say, the celebrity pair may be tying the knot soon. 
While earlier this year, there were some rumours that Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh may have already tied the knot in a secret ceremony, those were put to rest soon. Later, sources hinted at a low-key wedding to come later in the year. “It will be an extremely private, traditional Hindu ceremony with the couple tying the knot in the presence of only close friends and family. The couple is still deciding if they want a reception to follow,” a source had revealed. 
The four auspicious dates that were under consideration all fall between September and December 2018. A report in May this year seemed to hint at November 16 as the D-day. The update now is that the couple has zeroed in on November 10 for their wedding, which will most likely take place in Italy, a destination slowly becoming a favourite with Indian celebrities for their nuptials. Previously, Aditya Chopra and Rani Mukerji and Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma have chosen the European country for their weddings. It's rumoured that Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone have decided on Lake Como as the venue for their ceremony. 
Apparently, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's parents have already come together to gift the couple jewellery. Post their getaway to the Maldives, Deepika Padukone was also gifted a Sabyasachi sari by Jagjit Singh and Anju Bhavnani, Ranveer Singh's parents. 
Sources state that Deepika Padukone has already begun shopping for her trousseau with younger sister Anisha Padukone. Many fans have already taken to Twitter to say they'd love to see Deepika Padukone as a Sabyasachi bride. After all, the actor is a big fan of Sabyasachi's regal creations. 
You may not know it, but Ranveer Singh first met Deepika Padukone back in 2012 at the Zee Cine Awards in Macau. And he still remembers what she was wearing that night. When asked how, the actor replied to a fan on Twitter in 2015, saying, “How can one possibly forget that sight!?” Over the years, the actors have grown to become great friends. When Deepika Padukone made her Hollywood debut, Ranveer Singh was all support. “It is a proud moment for me,” Ranveer Singh had said. “I am very excited about the night. It is a big Hollywood film, we have some special guests in the city. It is the premiere of xXx, starring Deepika, who is a special co-star of mine and I am looking forward to watching the movie.” Most recently, Padukone, who appeared on an episode of BFFs With Vogue, admitted that “Ranveer Singh is the best kisser in the business”

Are those wedding bells we're hearing? 
From playing the ‘are they-aren't they' game with Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' dating life, the buzz on them has now graduated to speculations on the couple's reported engagement. Right now, the evidence stands at this—according to People magazine, Jonas shut down a Tiffany store in New York to shop for a ring. Simultaneously, Priyanka Chopra decided to discontinue working on Salman Khan's upcoming film Bharat. The director of the feature, Ali Abbas Zafar, tweeted confirming that Chopra will no longer be a part of the film for a “very very special” reason, with a pun that may be alluding to Nick Jonas. 
Yes Priyanka Chopra is no more part of @Bharat_TheFilm & and the reason is very very special , she told us in the Nick of time about her decision and we are very happy for her ... Team Bharat wishes @priyankachopra loads of love & happiness for life 😊😉😍 
— ali abbas zafar (@aliabbaszafar) July 27, 2018 
Priyanka Chopra is known to be fastidious with her work commitments, and if she felt the need to remove herself from a highly anticipated project, she must have had a good reason to do so. 
The Chopra-Jonas timeline starts at the MET Gala in 2017, when both were guests at the Ralph Lauren table for the annual extravaganza hosted by Vogue. All the media speculations and headlines were met with radio silence back then, but they were seen together again at the Dodgers game in Los Angeles over the Memorial Day weekend in May 2018. Ever since, there has been PDA on social media, a slew of dinner dates, family meetings, a wedding, engagement parties, Fourth of July celebrations and vacations. The rollercoaster ride of their relationship's evolution has had their fans hanging on to their seats in anticipation of the next curve. While most expected the two would spend a few years getting to know each other, Jonas and Chopra may have pulled a fast one, if the rumours of their engagement are to be believed. 
The singer-songwriter and multi-hyphenate star have already met each others families in the recent past, which is a sign of a serious relationship. They neither deny nor go overboard with the details of their romance either, which signifies stability. For now, the pressing questions on Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' apparent engagement remain—is the rock baguette-cut, a shapely marquise or a timeless pear? Was the proposal private or public? Will they move in together? Will there be two weddings? And will Meghan Markle be a part of the celebrations? 
We'll only know in time. Stay tuned to this space for all the updates.

The actor shared the special news in a Facebook Live video today 
Deepika Padukone is a household name across the nation. The award-winning actor's Bollywood career has seen her conquer millions of hearts over the past decade. Last year, the Padmavaat actor made an impression around the world with her Hollywood debut in xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, in which she starred alongside Vin Diesel, Nina Dobrev, and Ruby Rose. 
Now, Padukone is set to join a host of other Indian superstars, including Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, Madhuri Dixit-Nene, Shah Rukh Khan, and Amitabh Bachchan, who have been honoured with their own wax statues at the iconic Madame Tussauds museum in London. The actor, who is presently in the United Kingdom to be measured for the wax figure, announced the exciting news this morning in a Facebook Live video, revealing that statues of her will be unveiled early next year at the Madame Tussauds attractions in London and in New Delhi. 
Padukone, who was named by TIME Magazine as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2018, said, “It's an amazing feeling. It's fun, it's exciting, and in a way, I feel a lot of gratitude as well, because when you give back to your fans, when you give them the opportunity to interact, give them a little more than just the movies, I think that's always very special. I hope they love it as much as we've enjoyed the process of creating the figure. Madame Tussauds is so iconic in so many ways all over the world. It just feels great that I can be a small part of it.”

And why you need to own it 
When it comes to all that is current and relevant, handbags are in a league of their own. Emblematic of what's au courant, handbags are power players in the lexicon of fashion accessories and give off a sense of being ahead of the curve. What's unique about handbags is that once a new shape gains popularity on the scene, it stays around for a quite a long while, until new iterations crop up each season to give the style a facelift. Then there is the case of reviving an archival style—simply put, history likes to make a comeback in fashion every couple of decades. For autumn/winter 2018, Maria Grazia Chiuri drew parallels between the student protests of the late 1960s and those happening in the present day. And while vintage fashions of crochet and patchwork were brought back on the runway, so was Dior's iconic Saddle Bag. To those of you wanting to brush up on its origins and iconography, here's a quick refresher course. 
First introduced to Dior's audience by former creative director John Galliano for the spring/summer 2000 collection. Derived from the shape of a horse saddle, the handbag has a unique asymmetric shape with the unmissable metal D hanging from the flap. 
Carrie Bradshaw, Sarah Jessica Parker's fashion worshipping character from Sex and The City immortalised the bag in pop culture history. Beyoncé, Paris Hilton and Bella Hadid are noted fans of the Saddle. 
Maria Grazia Chiuri made some changes in the original design. “I thought this collection would be an opportunity to revive its timeless beauty. I consider this icon of the house's recent history the perfect accessory to deal with this battle that is daily life. Indeed, the Saddle Bag is a bag that is worn in exactly the same way as a shirt or jacket, and it's so comfortable to wear with its long strap that you almost forget it's there. The saddle bag is also practical because it allows you to carry everything you need with you. It's for this reason that I wanted it larger and more robust, but also very colourful, embroidered or with beaded fringe because, like a chameleon, it adapts to all situations,” she said. 
The Dior Saddle Bag has already made its way to the influencers. Jeanne Damas, Jessica Alba, Katie Holmes, Lou Douillon, Natalia Dyer and Olivia Palermo are amongst those who already own the bag. 
The Dior Saddle Bag launches worldwide today. Look through the slideshow for a first look at your new best friend now.

See who came to show their support for Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter 
In case you didn't already know, Dhadak is slated for release on July 20, and the anticipation for the movie is palpable. One of the most eagerly awaited films of 2018, this Dharma Productions remake of the critically acclaimed 2016 Marathi film Sairat will see Janhvi Kapoor, Sridevi's oldest daughter, make her Bollywood debut opposite Shahid Kapoor's brother Ishaan Khatter. An exclusive screening of the film took place in Mumbai yesterday, with many of the lead actors' family and friends in attendance, as well as prominent Bollywood icons like Rekha, Madhuri Dixit Nene and Karisma Kapoor. 
Janhvi Kapoor arrived at the premiere with sister Anshula Kapoor, and and the pair was joined by siblings Khushi and Arjun Kapoor and father Boney Kapoor. 22-year-old Beyond The Clouds actor Ishaan Khatter was accompanied by his mother Neelima Azeem, brother Shahid Kapoor and sister-in law Mira Rajput Kapoor. We also spotted producer Karan Johar at the screening, along with a host of celebrities including newlyweds Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi, Sonakshi Sinha, Soha Ali Khan, Kunal Khemu, Sara Ali Khan, Saqib Saleem, Malaika Arora, Kartik Aaryan, Huma Qureshi, Dino Morea, and Aadar Jain. Director Ashutosh Gowarikar and philanthropist Natasha Poonawalla were also seen at the premiere, adding to the show of love and encouragement for the young Dhadak stars. 
The trailer, which was revealed to the public on June 11 after months of speculation and intrigue, gave audiences a taste of what the upcoming romantic drama will bring: a compelling tale of two star-crossed lovers in Rajasthan, and the ensuing classism and societal pressures that pervade their relationship and their chance at a happy life together. 
Lately, Janhvi Kapoor has been making headlines for one more reason: her wardrobe. The Bollywood debutante, who was Vogue India's June 2018 cover star, owns a diverse sartorial collection boasting of covetable ensembles from international labels like Chanel, Gucci and Stella McCartney, along with Indian couture houses like Manish Malhotra, Sabyasachi and Anamika Khanna. With all of her recent promotional outings for the film, Kapoor has proven that she can pull off every look with ease, whether it's high-octane glamour or casual normcore.

On July 4, Sonali Bendre took to her Instagram page to share some saddening news with her followers. The Bollywood actor and mother of one has been diagnosed with a high grade cancer which has metastised, and is now currently going through treatment in New York. As soon as Bendre's post went out, the star received an outpour of love and support from not just her fans, but also her friends in the industry. Everyone from Sushmita Sen, Ranveer Singh and Sonam K Ahuja to designers Manish Malhotra and Sandeep Khosla responded to Bendre's post with positive wishes and prayers. 
Since then, Bendre has been facing cancer head on, and sharing the key moments from her journey on her social media page. On July 10, the actor made the world part of her experience as she cut her locks down into a pixie style, saying, “The outpouring of love I've received in the last few days has been so overwhelming… and I'm especially grateful to those of you who shared stories of your experiences in dealing with cancer, whether it was your own or of loved ones. Your stories have given me an extra dosage of strength and courage, and more importantly, the knowledge that I'm not alone.” 
Sonali Bendre's latest post shares another special message, and this time, it's for parents around the world who are going through a situation similar to hers. The actor shared her thoughts with a picture of herself with son Ranveer Behl in her arms, and her note is one that can inspire families everywhere. Read her message below. 
From the moment he was born 12 years, 11 months and 8 days ago, my amazing @rockbehl took ownership of my heart. From then on, his happiness and wellbeing have been the centre of anything @goldiebehl and I ever did. And so, when the Big C reared its ugly head, our biggest dilemma was what and how we were going to tell him. 
As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts. We've always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn't going to be different. He took the news so maturely… and instantly became a source of strength and positivity for me. In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things I need to do! 
I believe that it's imperative to keep kids involved in a situation like this. They are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for. It's important to spend time with them and include them, rather than make them wait on the side-lines, not being told yet instinctively knowing everything. In our effort to protect them from the pain and realities of life, we might end up doing the opposite. 
I'm spending time with Ranveer right now, while he's on summer vacation. His madness and shenanigans help me #SwitchOnTheSunshine. And today, we derive strength from each other #OneDayAtATime

An author goes back four centuries to rediscover the empress who broke all the rules, empowered women and reigned sovereign 
I first met Nur Jahan when I was a restless nine-year-old growing up in Dehradun. I loved stories, and my mother had a bagful of wondrous tales. She would dish out selections as she played with my sisters and me on summer afternoons or even when she was tired after a long day of running the household. Though some of my mother's stories were about animals—a parrot that advised its owner; a clever fox that fooled peasants—most were about unusual women. We heard about the brave Rani of Jhansi as well as the British Queen Victoria; Heer from the eternal love story Heer-Ranjha; the goddess Parvati, who stood up to her husband, the terrifying Shiva. Each story a reminder to us to behave more like these amazingly brave and independent women. 
One lazy afternoon, my mother and I sat playing gaind-gitta, bouncing a small ball with one hand and moving five dice with the other. At some point, I grew bored. “I want a story,” I said. I can't remember whether we finished the game but I remember the story well. 
Her story was about Nur Jahan, wife of the 17th-century Mughal emperor Jahangir. Years later, my fascination with Nur's story translated into my love for the history of the Mughal world—and the Mughal women, to be precise. In time I became a feminist historian, and soon I was writing Empress: The Astonishing Reign Of Nur Jahan, a biography of my childhood icon. 
As I researched, I noted that Jahangir's memoir was full of Nur's hunting feats. Hunting, a kingly right, was more than a leisure activity—it denoted imperial dominance. Nur's fiery shots would kill a tiger that prowled the streets of Mathura and harassed her people, making her their saviour. But hunting wasn't the only thing that made her so unusual. 
In 1611, at age 34, Nur, daughter of an eminent noble at Jahangir's court, and widow of a subversive official, became the 20th and most cherished wife of Jahangir, a moody, philosopher king. He was a lover of the arts, a naturalist who adored statistics and travelling. He saw Nur's political savviness, and, little by little, defied tradition by transferring his power and duty to her capable hands. By early 1613, in a regal encampment stretched for nearly three miles across Ajmer, in north-western India, Nur issued her first legal document as a sovereign, becoming the only woman in the Mughal dynasty to rule openly and actively. Jahangir was so infatuated with the “strength of her personality,” one courtier said, that the fabled Islamic lovers Majnun and Khusraw paled next to her. Nur's influence grew—in the harem, with her husband and, ultimately, in governance. 
Her reign was a massive feat. Only a few decades earlier, Akbar the Great, Nur's father-in-law, had instructed royal women to live in the sacred and secluded Mughal harem. Apart from playing the sovereign behind tented walls, courtier historians noted that Nur would sit like a goddess in the imperial balconies and show her person to the masses—a practice thus far reserved for the male kings. Unprecedentedly, coins of the realm—signs of sovereignty—bore her name along with her husband's. 
[#image: /photos/5ce42fa389be3674807d0533]||| |||  
As I delved further into her reign, she emerged not just as the huntress and administrator but also an astute politician and champion of women's rights. She devoted her early years to building political alliances and observing affairs of state closely. She was known for her “boundless and unlimited” generosity. She gave jewels, horses, elephants and cash to royal men and women. And she went on to support the weddings of 500 orphan girls and even designed an inexpensive wedding dress. Agra tour guides say the dress still sells and is still used today by brides of poorer families! 
Nur initiated marriages of her women companions under the age of 40 to Jahangir's troopers and attendants, and gave those between 40 and 70 the choice of either leaving the palace to look for a husband, or staying with her. By offering choices to the underprivileged and to the most vulnerable inhabitants of the harem, she sparked a “feminist” moment in Mughal history. 
Nur Jahan, a feminist icon approximately four centuries ago? We're likely to differ on the use of this word: after all, it is birthed by our politically concerned mid-20th-century women ancestors. Even so, we are likely to agree on a most basic tenet of feminism. It urges us to be curious about different styles of creativeness and enterprise of women across time and space. And everything Nur did—politically, aesthetically, in building her life and that of the empire—had an intimacy about it. She went about it deliberately, directly, rolling up her sleeves (just as we do), never giving up. Astutely, persistently, brilliantly. 
My mother called her maharani (queen of queens in Hindi). Of all the stories I'd heard about Nur Jahan, what stuck with me was that while she ruled the empire alongside her husband, dispensing justice and masterminding daring rescues, she also wrote poetry and designed clothing, gardens and even buildings. She was a new royal with the experiences of an unusual past. Nur's assertion of authority and talent is revelatory, not least because she moved towards a direct and visible kind of power. In a time and place when her power ought to have been squashed, it tells us something about her commitment, boldness, independence and confidence in who she was. Is that not feminist?

Of course, Disneyland was on the itinerary 
Paris is always a good idea, and no one knows that better than Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The actor recently flew to the French capital as part of a Longines campaign, and even watched France emerge victorious in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Rai Bachchan took to Instagram to share pictures of the ecstatic crowd outside her hotel room celebrating as they rejoiced France's first win in twenty years. From the photos, we can see hundreds of French fans showing off their red, white and blue attire in support of the historic win. 
Of course, with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan giving her company, Disneyland had to be part of the itinerary. The actor captured an adorable picture of them sharing a kiss in front of the iconic castle at the theme park. The mother-daughter duo looked to be in high spirits as they enjoyed the rides, but that wasn't the only highlight of their holiday. The proud mother also posted several pictures of Aaradhya dressed up for a Longines event, where they were accompanied by Aishwarya's mother, Brindya Rai. 
Often touted as one of the most beautiful women in the world, Rai Bachchan looked stunning when she visited the InterContinental Paris. The Longines Ambassador of Elegance sported an elegant black gown while posing at the magnificent Salon Opera at the luxury hotel. She wore another intricate black dress (we know her love for the colour) while enjoying the beautiful weather at the event.

The actor filmed a dance number with her co-stars for her latest movie, Isn't It Romantic 
ICYMI, Priyanka Chopra has just wrapped up shooting for her new movie Isn't It Romantic in New York City. Like most things she does, this event was completed with a bang as well—the cast took to the streets to celebrate the final segment of the shoot yesterday: a musical number. Her co-stars, including Liam Hemsworth, Rebel Wilson and Adam DeVine, were all seen shaking a leg with the actor outside Grand Central station for what is being touted to be a song in the upcoming movie. 
It seems like Chopra is not ready to step away from her Bollywood roots just yet, no matter where her work is taking her. Social media was swamped with pictures of the star showing off her dance moves during the shoot yesterday, and director Todd Strauss-Schulson took to Instagram to show off his talented crew. One of the pictures showed the cast mid-dance, and was captioned: "Looking at these photos tonight, I actually can't believe this is what I spent the morning directing. The most fun, funny, joyous musical number w the most talented cast and incredible dancers right in the heart of NYC." hinting that the film will probably feature a Bollywood-inspired dance routine. 
Slated for a Valentine's Day release, the film seems to be an interesting take on traditional rom-coms. The story revolves around a young woman living in NYC, who finds herself stuck in a movie and tries to escape every possible cliché. Considering the amount of stereotypes Chopra has broken on her way to Hollywood, she seems like a perfect fit for the role. Are you excited for this one?

This album will make your day 
Ever since the trailer of Dhadak first released, all eyes in the country have been on Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter. While the film's first look has Kapoor (playing the role of the assertive Parthavi) showing us her fierce side, the lighter moments in the clip also gave Khatter (who portrays happy-go-lucky Madhu) a chance to make his fans laugh with this hilarious singing skills. As we come closer to Dhadak's release date, what most Bollywood fans are interested in is what Ishaan Khatter and Janhvi Kapoor are really like off the screen. And if you've been tracking the co-stars on social media, you'll know that their chemistry IRL is completely different from what we've seen in Dhadak's sneak peeks, but it is just as exciting. 
Over the past few weeks, Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter have been travelling all over India promoting Dhadak, and it looks like the two are having a blast together. While the duo share an intense romantic bond in the film, their off-screen relationship is like most friends'—full of banter and silly jokes. The first time fans got a glimpse of this was when Kapoor shared this theatric video of herself fainting in Khatter's arms, and since then, both stars have been loading up their Instagram stories with hilarious, unmissable moments from their lives. 
So what are Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter usually up to when they're not giving interviews? The actors love dancing to their favourite tracks together and pigging out on junk food (you can't miss Khatter's commentary when Kapoor tried to order him a pizza a few weeks ago). Most recently, Kapoor shared a clip of Khatter swinging through a bus like it was a jungle gym, while Khatter got her to publicly reveal the fact that she likes to think of her snack containers as a happy family. Love their quirks? Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter also can't seem to stop having fun when it comes to being shot by the paparazzi—have you seen how they like to pose for the shutterbugs when they're on the go? 
Between all that, the co-stars also manage to bring their Dhadak avatars out to reality every once in a while. Don't miss the loved-up video of Khatter and Kapoor practicing their dance moves for the film's title track, or the video clip from the time Khatter admitted that the word that reminds him of Kapoor is ‘beautiful'. These two may just seal their spot as Bollywood's favourite new duo with their refreshingly platonic and relatable equation.

The mom-to-be is glowing! 
With baby number two on the way, Mira Rajput Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor cannot seem to contain their excitement. The two hosted an intimate yet picture-perfect baby shower for the mom-to-be yesterday, attended by their closest friends. Shahid's younger brother Ishaan Khatter made sure to be part of the special day too, alongside Dhadak co-star Janhvi Kapoor. 
While Rajput Kapoor (who has been giving us lessons on making maternity dressing cool for months now) was glowing in an off-shoulder polka dot dress by Zimmermann for the event, Shahid Kapoor opted for a darker ensemble: a black patterned shirt with navy trousers. 
All the Instagram posts put up by the Kapoors' guests made sure that their fans did not feel left out from the festivities at the couple's sea-facing Juhu home. One of the sweetest photographs from the celebration was that of Mira Rajput Kapoor feeding her husband a bite of the delicious-looking lemon cake that was decorated with sprigs of baby's breath, while other snapshots gave us a glimpse at her pregnancy glow, as she posed in a specially decorated chair reading, ‘Mommy', surrounded by all her friends. 
The Kapoors are already parents to one-year-old Misha, and took to Instagram earlier this year to announce the news of their second bundle of joy being on the way. Do you remember this adorable picture of little Misha lying down next to a doodle that reads ‘Big sister'?

Find out who Hima Das is, and why you need to know her name 
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World U20 Championships that are taking place in Tampere, Finland witnessed a historic moment this week. 18-year-old sprinter Hima Das, who hails from Assam and is the daughter of a rice farmer, became the first Indian track athlete to win a medal at the biennial world championships, during what was clearly an adrenaline-inducing race. 
Das defeated Andrea Miklos of Romania and Taylor Manson of the USA to win first place in the women's 400m final race, with a track timing of 51.46 seconds. She has also clocked an Indian record of 51.32 seconds previously, when she finished sixth in the women's 400m finals at the Commonwealth Games that were held at the Gold Coast in Australia earlier this year. 
Hima Das' victory is as phenomenal–she only began training last year–as it is momentous. We are in an age where women are fighting to be taken seriously as competition in the sporting world. Sports are one of the most significant socio-cultural learning experiences we have when we're growing up, and research proves that girls who play from a young age are more likely to be confident and excel academically than those who don't. Furthermore, playing sports boosts self-esteem and physiological well-being, and also reduces the risk of depression. 
Interestingly, Das' triumph coincided with the fifth anniversary of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, the biographical film about former track and field sprinter Milkha Singh. Farhan Akhtar, who starred as Singh in the 2013 biopic, shared his congratulations on Twitter with a little-known fact—that the legendary sportsman's biggest dream was to witness an Indian athlete win gold in track and field. Some of India's biggest names joined Akhtar in expressing their praise on the social media platform.

As we get closer to the Section 377 verdict that’s being re-examined by the Supreme Court’s new panel, designer Suneet Varma talks to Vogue about its potential impact on the LGBTQ community in India, the dated nature of these laws, and why ultimately, what’s most important is a shift in mindset 
Soon, the Supreme Court will release a revised verdict for section 377, hopefully decriminalising homosexuality, and bringing freedom to a lot of people who've lived extremely restrained lives all these years. India has gone back and forth on this issue that's truly very demeaning to this minority. These are people that didn't feel safe in their own country or believe that they could live freely. You can't play with people's lives or pass judgement on their choices because of archaic laws. 
And yet, I still don't think that a positive outcome would inspire me to celebrate. The verdict will be a first step, but the issue is not just about a change in the laws. In spite of what the result might be, I can't say that same-sex couples won't face any stigma or judgement, that neighbours won't be talking about them behind their backs, or that they won't face discrimination ever again. We have a long way to go if we want to change mindsets. 
I find that the newly re-instituted panel of the Supreme Court—chief justice Dipak Misra, in particular—has been quite forceful and positive about it. He has definitely brought up valid points about the fundamental injustice of telling people how to live their lives, and the need for freedom of choice in everyone's lives irrespective of their sexual orientation. Look at the rest of the world—the innumerable pride parades; Luxembourg's prime minister Xavier Bettel, who was the first European politician to have a same-sex marriage; or Queen Elizabeth II's cousin, Lord Ivar Mountbatten, marrying his long-time partner James Coyle—a gay royal wedding, imagine that! That's how things are changing everywhere else. The fact that we're the sixth largest economy in the world and we're still fighting for basic rights, does not make sense. 
In fact, I find this oppression towards homosexuality quite paradoxical—India is tolerant in so many other ways. Every religion, colour, caste and community live in fair harmony and they have for several centuries. If you think about it, the concept of homosexuality is so old to humankind—several references of it along with transvestism and eunuchs exist in our religious texts, sculptures and art—all of which are a large part of our history. That's why the place we're in right now seems even more ironic. 
The problem lies in the discussion, or lack thereof. People are afraid to take a stance or speak up, but I'm not sure what they're afraid of. I've overheard (and been part of) conversations with reasonably conservative people who don't really have an opinion on homosexuality. They will let you live with your choice as they live with theirs. But since most people don't engage in conversations around this topic, there's this assumption that the majority isn't comfortable with non-traditional sexual orientations—an unintelligent assumption. I recently read a world consensus that said that at any given time, 3-5 per cent of the world's population lies in the LGBTQ+ spectrum. This means that India would've witnessed centuries of homosexuality. Even today, every person has gay people in their circles. I grew up in a very open-minded house. My parents had gay friends; there's a low-income embroidery artist in my office who is homosexual. It's quite common, but people just don't want to acknowledge it. 
I remember being at an impressive dinner table 20 years ago in Mumbai. I was talking to a married, older gentleman. He asked me if I was married and I said, “No, I'm gay and I live with my partner.” I'll never forget the look on his face when he responded saying, “I've been sitting on the fence for the last 30 years myself.” I don't know what brought about such an honest response—was it with a sense of envy, relief or pride that he saw a young man, living his best and most authentic life? I will never know, but it was an eye-opener. Since then, I've known of several people who still haven't come out of the closet—it must be difficult to not be able to reconcile with your reality. 
I came out to my parents in my early '20s. They weren't really concerned with my orientation—it was more about my well-being than the stigma around being gay. We grew up in a close-knit, progressive family and I remember confiding in my siblings and being very open about it. As a family, we addressed it and the support came along immediately. I might have struggled as a teenager and tried to understand why I was different, but once I knew that this was my reality, I never struggled too much with anyone else's opinion. 
I'm legally married to my husband Rahul, and I live my life the only way I've ever known how to—I don't hide my orientation and I don't make a scene about it either. I have never allowed any court of law to tell me how to live. I'm only answerable to one person and that's my god above. I was born this way and I take a lot of pride in living with the choices I make. The only thing I can say to the government is that they're not invited into my bedroom, and I'm not interested in what's going on in theirs.

With a little help from the House of Anita Dongre 
Have you ever thought about where your clothes come from? Really thought about it? Who made the top you're wearing right now? How was it made? Most importantly, why does it even matter? We live in a world where sustainable development is quickly becoming a priority, and rightly so. Climate change, overpopulation, pollution—the list of pressing environmental concerns plaguing our planet is endless and distressing. There's no doubt that we need to become more conscious of the way we conduct every aspect of our daily lives, and become more attentive consumers, especially with our clothes. Sustainable fashion has started to gain momentum with high-street brands, like H&M and Zara, and even high-end labels like Gucci, pledging to put sustainability at the heart of their businesses. 
This year, 24 students from the University of Edinburgh (UoE) jetted down from Scotland to India to embark on an immersive Sustainable Fashion trek from May 27 to June 1, along with eight students from the Indian School of Design and Innovation (ISDI). The overseas excursion—developed by UoE staff Dr Winston Kwon, Chancellor's Fellow, and Amrita Sadarangani, regional director of South Asia, along with Ayesha Sodha, Arti Mishra, and Bhagyashri Salunkhe of the university's South Asia regional team—was meticulously planned to take students on a tour that followed the supply chain, from cotton pickers and growers in Maharashtra to the couture houses of metropolitan Mumbai. 
The interactive experience allowed students to fully engage in the way the Indian textiles industry operates, and to gain a lay of the land. The trip began in Mumbai at Mani Bhavan in Gamdevi, after which the students made their way to the ARTISANS' gallery at Kala Ghoda to participate in a textiles workshop led by founder Radhi Parikh. They also made a field trip to the Technocraft factory in Murbad, Maharashtra, to learn about cotton-spinning and weaving. On the third day of their trip, the students visited Palghar, which was a transformative experience as they were able to see artisans in the process of working on Grassroot, the House of Anita Dongre's sustainable, craft-based fashion line. On Day 4, the undergraduates spent the day at the House of Anita Dongre headquarters in Navi Mumbai, where they met the designer herself. They also made a trip to her retail store in Khar West, to see where her final masterpieces end up before they are sold. 
The students also received a talk from Vogue India's fashion and e-commerce editor Rujuta Vaidya, and managing editor Renuka Modi, followed by a networking session with UoE alumni and Sustainability Nexus network members at the ISDI campus in Parel. Finally, on the last day of their journey, the group attended talks and a panel discussion at ISDI, organised by Pavithra Mohanraj of Infinitive, a startup that advises businesses aiming to accelerate their transition to a Circular Economy. The talks featured representatives and experts from the Bombay Hemp Company (BoHeCo), Forum For The Future, an NGO tackling complex sustainability challenges across the globe, the Centre for Environmental Research and Education (CERE), and AIMday, which puts organisations into contact with scientists, facilitating an exchange of knowledge. 
The Sustainable Fashion trek allowed interaction between students from different disciplines across the university, encouraged conversation, and opened up a dialogue about social mobility, dignity of labour, gender issues and the democratisation of crafts. As a result of this trip, several students have elected to write their final-year dissertations with organisations they encountered during their visit, and others are thinking about franchising BoHeCo products in India. Finally, every student is taking back a physical souvenir that will last a lifetime, thanks to the power of sustainable fashion. 
Scroll through the slideshow below for a glimpse at the journey these students went on.

Details this way 
Natasha Poonawalla needs no introduction. Not only is she a philanthropist and businesswoman but also a familiar face on the front row. This week, Poonawalla was witness to one of the most talked about events on the fashion calendar: Dolce & Gabbana's Alta Moda show. It comes as no surprise that she was in attendance, as the label's statement pieces are a staple in her wardrobe (we're never getting over her look at the Met Gala this year). 
Held in Italy at sundown, and on the banks of Lake Como, the show saw a line-up inspired by The Betrothed, a 19th century novel by Alessandro Manzoni. Models including the likes of Ashley Graham, Naomi Campbell and Dipti Sharma took the ramp in inherently opulent pieces. On what she loved most, Poonawalla says, “I love how authentic Domenico [Dolce] keeps it. Every detail of the experience, from their use of old steam boats, to the local monuments, music and the culture, attests to the fact that this show was a genuine expression of Italian brilliance.” 
The most Instagram-worthy moment on the runway? A custom-made sari sent out on Sharma. The idea for the ensemble was visualised with the Uttarakhand-born model: the designers simply gave her the fabric and asked how she would drape it as a sari.

There’s football, and then there’s Neymar. Twitter may have a field day after the Brazil vs Belgium match tonight 
This evening, as we're all glued to our television sets for the quarterfinal match between Brazil and Belgium in the FIFA World Cup, much attention will also be on whether we get to watch the next episode in the saga that's now called #NeymarRolling. While the footballing talents of Neymar Jr, the Brazilian forward remain undisputed, his propensity for exaggerated dives and tumbles following tackles and nudges (or a much milder version of the two) have been the cause of much criticism and hilarity lately. (A recent report by Swiss TV station RTS sport says Neymar has spent 14 minutes on the ground in the tournament in Russia.) 
While he's not the only one trying to yellow-card opponents or earn free kicks and penalty kicks for his team, the long tumble he took in the group-stage match against Serbia in FIFA 2018 is particularly played back and mocked along with the one at their last knockout stage match against Mexico, where, after Miguel Layun stepped on his ankle while trying to pick up the ball, a curled-up Neymar started bouncing off the field. It was a like watching corn popping in a microwave. Very entertaining, but also a little irritating and scary. The roll in the Serbia match even inspired a KFC ad in South Africa, where a footballer rolls out of the ground and through town to get to a KFC outlet, ending in the tagline: “Make a meal of it.” 
There might be another side to the story too: When a boy keeps crying wolf, chances are the wolf would have appeared once in a while. If you're tackled, you'd want to get something out of it, and the easiest way to convince someone of your pain is not through subtlety and gritted teeth. Neymar is the most fouled player in this FIFA 2018—the Paris Saint-Germain star has been tackled 23 times. If he thinks he deserves some payback, can you blame him entirely? Scroll through the slideshow for some of the funniest memes Twitteratis have come up with at Neymar's expense.

Get to know the designer who will be showcasing at the International Fashion Showcase at London Fashion Week 2019 
“Hi, this is Naushad Ali from Puducherry,” a cheery voice greets me on the phone when I call the designer to discuss his latest accolade. Evidently excited about being one of the 16 designers selected from across the globe to showcase at the International Fashion Showcase at London Fashion Week 2019 through IMG Reliance, Ali is on track with his personal goal of taking his label to the international platform by 2020. 
The biennial fashion presentation is a partnership between the British Council, British Fashion Council, London College of Fashion, UAL and Somerset House, to shine the spotlight on up and coming talent from all over the world. India first made waves at IFS by winning the International Fashion Showcase Country Award in 2017 for its installation, titled “The Indian Pastoralists”co-curated by IMG Reliance. The format of choosing multiple designers from each country has now been tweaked to highlight one designer per country, and this time, Naushad Ali was picked from 90 such designers. 
The shortlisted 16 will undergo a specially tailored course created by the London School of Fashion and Somerset House, which lays emphasis on the understanding the business in Europe, as well as design innovation. “It's an online portal course, however, we will be meeting in London this August first so that we get to know each other better and exchange ideas and get feedback from our mentors directly. We will go back in February for an evaluation of what we learn over the months,” Ali explains. Vogue helps you get to know the designer better. 
I would say it is a big part of it. A lot of people knew me as a boy experimenting in a small town. That has always been a challenge and inspiration for us. When I started our unit four years ago, I had considered different places including Goa and Chennai, but by then I had stayed in Puducherry for nearly eight years and it had done enough damage to me. It is a wonderful place to be in as a creative person. So I thought, why not be here and do the things we set out to? I gave myself five years—this is the fourth year, and looks like it is working. 
I was interested in biology as a student. But to me, the appeal was always in the diagrams and observing patterns. I considered physics, but that never happened. My dad was into reselling Indian textiles, so I grew up around that environment and interestingly enough, I came back to that. I set out to study Textile Design but was keen to move to Fashion Design. However, we are very focused on textiles as a brand and produce our own. 90 per cent of creating our collections is about working on the fabric. 
Our long-term goal is to move weaving to Puducherry, but at the moment we extensively work with looms in West Bengal. Most of our collections are focused on fabric from West Bengal, but we broke the pattern last season and did block printing in Jodhpur. We tried to stay away from the traditional motifs and do more minimal ones. This year, Lakmé Fashion Week put us in touch with a weaving cluster in Tamil Nadu, and we have produced some lovely cotton fabric from there that you will see on the runway soon. 
We have been very dedicated to the idea of sustainability from the inception of our brand. It started with a basic practice. Since we produce our own fabric, we really value it. Once the production of one lot is done, we segregate the leftover fabric according to colour and size into different boxes. Then we create patterns to consume these pieces—cropped shirts, tops, use them as panels etc, which creates another collection of 60 to 80 pieces. We have come to a stage where we utilise nearly 95 per cent of our fabric. Obviously we make sure it looks like all the other garments, and never compromise on the quality. We have been brainstorming on the idea of encouraging our customers to buy less, and invest in a beautiful product instead. 
2018 was our target to go international, and we showcased at Who's Next [the leading international fashion trade show for womenswear in Europe]. IFS comes in at the right time for me as designer. There is so much to learn from the program's structure, which focuses on improving our design and business skills. It takes us to a platform that lets us interact with other designers and industry personas; we are very fortunate to be one of the 16. I think the course is going to help me come up with more imaginative ideas. Why does a sustainable brand have to be boring? I can also be exciting and interactive, so I'm looking at those aspects for the installation. I have my one-on-one mentorship at 10:30pm India time, I have assignments to do, I get feedback... it's like going back to school and I love it. I can't just sit in Puducherry and do what I am doing now forever and expect myself to grow. Pinterest and the Internet are not going to teach me much beyond a point. Interacting in person is what really helps you to grow.

Living their best life 
While you were trying to get through the nth meeting this week, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas were in New York City, riding their bikes, twinning in shorts and summery white tees. To celebrate the Fourth of July holiday, the couple were seen cycling in New York City in what can only be dubbed as a perfect ‘celebs are just like us' moment. They were accompanied by a group of friends, including Joe Jonas and his fiancée, actor Sophie Turner. According to Nick Jonas' Instagram post, spending time together with his brothers is a July 4 tradition, and they honoured it this year too. 
Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' couple status might be new, but the two are wasting no time in getting to know each other better. First the duo attended Nick Jonas' cousin's wedding in New Jersey together. Then, a couple of weeks ago, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas were spotted in India visiting the Quantico star's family. They soon took off to Goa for a fun-filled holiday with Chopra's friends and family, including cousin Parineeti Chopra, and were seen attending Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's pre-engagement sangeet upon their return. Next thing we know, Chopra was off to Brazil with Jonas, where he was performing. Finally back to New York now, the happy couple seems to have spent a relaxed day off with their close ones. 
Cycling may not seem like the perfect partner activity, but there's something to be said of the nostalgic, comforting, even liberating exercise—especially when your life involves shuttling between continents on a private charter. Chopra sported a white T-shirt with a back-tie detail and cutoff shorts for her day out, while Nick Jonas wore his white T-shirt with basketball shorts, with his sleeves rolled up. As per usual, Chopra and Jonas did not shy away from exhibiting some mild PDA in public. Double dates, concerts, family holidays—what more can new love be made of? Scroll through the slideshow below for a look at the celebrity couple's bicycle date.

Are you thinking what we are thinking? 
ICYMI, the new poster of Fanney Khan has just been released, and Bollywood fans are as excited about the fresh look at the movie as they are confused. The film's new sneak peek features Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in a new avatar, sporting red highlights and a studded military jacket. 
But look closer at the poster and you'll realise that Rai Bachchan looks so concerned. Hiding behind her is a man in a Rajinikanth mask, who was later revealed to be Anil Kapoor. Also attempting to conceal his identity behind Rai Bachchan is a stunned Rajkummar Rao. But the reaction of the characters can be attributed to an almost-missable detail in Fanney Khan's official posters. Check out the ropes winding around Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's wrists in the images. In this remake of the 2000 Dutch comedy and Academy Award-nominated film, Everybody's Famous!, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan plays a pop star kidnapped by Kapoor, a father who is desperate to see his daughter succeed in the music industry. Her character is allegedly a huge fan of Lata Mangeshkar, and rumour has it we will get to see Rai Bachchan paying tribute to the iconic playback singer in the movie too. 
While we can deduce the roles Kapoor and Rai Bachchan will be playing, Rao's role still remains very much a mystery. Co-produced by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Pictures Productions and T-Series, and directed by Atul Manjrekar, the film supposedly features dances orchestrated by Frank Gatson Jr, a choreographer renowned for having worked with the likes of Beyoncé, Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez. 
Before Kapoor shared the first two posters of Fanney Khan today, Rai Bachchan had taken to her official Instagram account earlier this week to treat fans with a teaser you can't help but watch on repeat. The film clearly portrays characters who are greatly inspired by Bollywood. After much speculation of Rai Bachchan being linked to projects such as Anurag Kashyap's Gulab Jamun, where she will reportedly be sharing the silver screen with husband Abhishek Bachchan, and Jasmine: Story of a Leased Womb, a tale about a surrogate mother, we can finally be sure to see her grand return to the big screen in Fanney Khan on August 3. Check out the teaser Rai Bachchan had posted below.

Flash mobs, selfies and so much more 
It's safe to say that the night of Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement celebrations is one that Bollywood fans across the country won't forget easily. The wedding festivities begun with three lavish celebrations at Antilia—a pre-engagement mehandi function took place first, followed by a pre-engagement sangeet and then the official engagement, which took place on June 30. 
The star-studded engagement saw the biggest names of Bollywood in attendance, including Shah Rukh Khan with wife Gauri Khan and son Aryan Khan, Aamir Khan, Kiran Rao, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kajol, Karan Johar, Anil Kapoor, Rhea Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Parineeti Chopra, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra, Ranbir Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Rekha, Shweta Bachchan Nanda with daughter Navya Naveli Nanda, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and wife Anupama Chopra, Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff. 
Mother-daughter duo Nita and Isha Ambani greeted the guests for the evening as they entered their Mumbai home, Antilia, which was also the venue for the night. A slew of entertainment awaited the partygoers inside, including aerial dance and musical performances and flash mobs. While singer Kailash Kher set the tone for the evening with his power-packed vocals, Karan Johar posed with longtime friends Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan, aptly captioning the picture as “Years of love....years of movies....memories forever.... ❤”. Shraddha Kapoor, Parineeti Chopra and Alia Bhatt were also caught in a candid picture. 
One look at the star-studded guest list and you'll realise that the biggest names of Bollywood are some of the Ambanis' closest friends. We spotted Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Arjun Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor, Karan Johar perform to ‘Gal Mitthi Mitthi Bol' dance with Nita Ambani, Anant Ambani, Isha Ambani and other members of the Ambani family in true Bollywood style. In case you didn't know already, Shah Rukh Khan was also hosting this evening, entertaining the crowds with his sheer wit and pulling jokes on Anant Ambani and others. 
Despite the likes of Rekha, Alia Bhatt, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Ranbir Kapoor and other Bollywood stalwarts being present at Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement, it was the star kids that really stole the show. Aryan Khan stepped in front of the cameras with mother Gauri, a splitting image of father, while Navya Naveli Nanda wowed everyone in a stunning Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla sari.

What were the stars up to? 
June 30 was an important day for the Ambani family—it marked the official engagement of Mukesh and Nita Ambani's eldest, Akash Ambani. Three months after Akash proposed to childhood friend Shloka Mehta, the couple celebrated their union with a lavish week-long celebration in Mumbai. The festivities began with a pre-engagement mehandi function, and was followed up with a pre-engagement sangeet that saw everyone from Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor to Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan in attendance, and also Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas. After all that excitement, Antilia was lit up once again last night—for Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's final ceremony, the engagement. There to congratulate the happy duo were stars including Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kajol, Karan Johar, Gauri Khan and son Aryan Khan, Anil Kapoor, Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff. Joining them were Shraddha Kapoor, Parineeti Chopra, Sara Ali Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Shweta Bachchan Nanda with daughter Navya Naveli Nanda, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and wife Anupama Chopra, Aamir Khan, Kiran Rao, Alia Bhatt, Madhuri Dixit and Shaina NC. 
While you've most likely already seen what the celebrity guests wore for Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's big night, you may have missed out on are all the inside pictures from the evening that are (already) doing the rounds on the internet. While Shraddha Kapoor began her evening by taking a fun Boomerang in her Koesch lehenga, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Navya Naveli Nanda made sure to get a picture with Aaradhya Bachchan, and Parineeti Chopra gave her fans a glimpse inside the Ambanis' special night with a selfie video featuring Aditya Roy Kapur. Some of the most best Bollywood pictures from the evening, however, had to be the ones that featured Karan Johar. While the director shared a snapshot of himself with Aryan Khan captioned “the godson!”, Kajol posted a picture of herself giving old friend Johar a big hug, and said, “Smile beats pout every time!” Add to Neetu Kapoor's adorable selfie with her “two sons” Ranbir Kapoor and Ayan Mukerji to the mix, and you've got yourself an album full of celebrity moments that cannot be missed.

The flash mob also featured Ranbir Kapoor, Abhishek Bachchan and more 
Throughout the weekend, the nation has been buzzing with news of Mukesh and Nita Ambani's eldest son, Akash Ambani's engagement to childhood friend Shloka Mehta. The celebrations were lavish to say the least—the official engagement ceremony took place on June 30 at the Ambanis' Mumbai residence, Antilia, and was succeeded by two other functions. The guest list was as star-studded as you can imagine, which explains the number of glamorous photos currently circulating the internet. The true gem of the evening, however, is this exciting video of the partygoers dancing to "Gal Mitthi Mitthi" from the 2010 Sonam K Ahuja-starrer, Aisha. As the crowd took to the stage, we spotted Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Abhishek Bachchan, Navya Naveli Nanda, and Ayan Mukerji shaking a leg and showing off their Bollywood moves. The happy couple's family, including Akash Ambani's mother Nita, brother Anant, sister Isha, and brother-in-law-to-be Anand Piramal were also seen partaking in the festivities. 
Earlier this year, Akash Ambani popped the question to Shloka Mehta at an intimate lawn ceremony in Goa, surrounded by their families. Since then, they have celebrated their union with various parties and gatherings, including a pre-engagement mehandi and a sangeet. Their official engagement saw Mehta sporting a pastel pink lehenga by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, featuring intricate beadwork, sequins and embroidered floral motifs. The blushing bride-to-be accessorised her designer ensemble with a striking diamond necklace, a maang tikka and bangles, while Ambani complemented his bride-to-be in a handsome maroon sherwani. Check out the video of the Ambani-Mehta engagement festivities now.

Don't miss a single update 
It was back in March 2018 that Akash Ambani proposed to girlfriend and childhood friend Shloka Mehta in an intimate get-together in Goa. And three months later, the couple officially got engaged tonight at Mukesh and Nita Ambani's Mumbai residence, Antilia. In case you missed it, Akash and Shloka's engagement has been a lavish affair. The couple kickstarted their celebrations earlier this week with a pre-engagement mehandi ceremony, which was attended by Priyanka Chopra. The festivities then continued to include a pre-engagement sangeet, where Chopra was joined by rumoured boyfriend Nick Jonas, along with a number of Bollywood stars including Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Karan Johar, Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan. 
It comes as no surprise then that for Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's main engagement ceremony, the bride and groom's families went all out. This time around, the guest list included more stars than any of the events before. There to celebrate the couple's big day were Kajol, Karan Johar, Gauri Khan (who was seen in a Tarun Tahiliani sari gown) and son Aryan Khan, Anil Kapoor, Disha Patani, Tiger Shroff, Rahul Bose, and Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (in Manish Malhotra) with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan. Joining them were other bigwigs like Ranbir Kapoor, Shweta Bachchan Nanda with daughter Navya Naveli Nanda, Sara Ali Khan, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and wife Anupama Chopra, Shraddha Kapoor, Amir Khan, Kiran Rao, Alia Bhatt, Madhuri Dixit and Shaina NC. Word is that Shah Rukh Khan is hosting the night's proceedings. 
Bride-to-be Shloka Mehta's lehenga choices this week have been all about keeping it elegant. After being seen in that blue Anamika Khanna ensemble at the mehandi function, Mehta celebrated her pre-engagement sangeet in two looks—a gold Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla lehenga, and then a blush pink Sabyasachi version. For the evening of her engagement, the bride went with pastel pink once again. Shloka Mehta smiled for the cameras in a bejewelled pink lehenga, worn with a heavy net dupatta and diamond jewellery. Akash Ambani complemented her in a maroon sherwani. 
While Shloka Mehta opted for pink tonight, sister-in-law Isha Ambani was unmissable at the engagement party in her silver lehenga, completely embroidered with vibrant pink and yellow blooms. A bride-to-be herself, Isha wore the heavy lehenga skirt with an embellished silver blouse and emerald choker. Mother Nita Ambani joined her for pictures in a pastel Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla ensemble embroidered in a very similar style. Joining them on the happy occasion were family Anil and Tina Ambani, both dressed in white. Tina Ambani complemented her ivory anarkali with a layered ruby necklace for the evening.

Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's much awaited engagement ceremony finally took place in Mumbai today. Easily amongst the biggest of big, fat Indian weddings, the Ambani and Mehta families seem to have left no stone unturned in making the union one of the grandest celebrations seen in the country. The engagement party was held after two pre-engagement ceremonies earlier in the week, a mehandi and a sangeet. Given the excitement around the occasion, the couple posed for pictures outside the Ambani residence, Antilia. Shloka Mehta picked a baby pink lehenga by Abu Jani Sandeep Kholsa for the evening. 
The pastel lehenga was glimmering with sequins and beadwork and bore floral motifs. The blouse featured a sheer neckline and scalloped edges, which made the look interesting. Blush is clearly a popular colour for wedding lehengas currently, and is perfect for a young bride-to-be. True to her style, Mehta picked a diamond necklace, maang tika and bangles to go with her designer ensemble. Akash Ambani on the other hand, complemented her look in a maroon sherwani. Sister Isha Ambani also chose a lehenga by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, as did mother Nita Ambani. The two sisters-in-law were seen posing together for pictures at their residence for the paparazzi. 
Mehta's hairstyle and makeup was put together by Puneet B Saini and Priyanka Borkar, who often work with Alia Bhatt. While the bride-to-be wore her jet black hair open with soft curls and twists around her crown, her makeup was dewy and minimal. A brick-nude lipstick, kohl and highlighter were the key elements of her beauty look. 
The bride-to-be has proven to be a fan of couturiers Abu Jani Sandeep Kholsa time and again. She was first seen in a lehenga by the label at Sonam K Ahuja and Anand S Ahuja's reception ceremony. For her mehandi ceremony before the engagement, Mehta picked an Anamika Khanna gown, which was embroidered in the designer's signature threadwork. This was followed by a pre-engagement sangeet ceremony, for which Mehta wore two outfits. First was an ornate Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla lehenga in gold and the other a blush pink lehenga by Sabyasachi. 
The couple was joined by Akash's brother Anand Ambani, sister Isha Ambani, and mother Nita Ambani for pictures. Given the nature of the events preceding the engagement, we're sure that this one will also be attended by a guest list studded with A-listers and Bollywood's bigwigs.

Ever since Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement invites hit the internet, well-wishers of the Ambani family have been buzzing with excitement over Mukesh and Nita Ambani's firstborn's big day. In case you missed it, the artistic digi-invite shared the details of Akash and Shloka's engagement party against a backdrop of rustling trees and "Shubhaarambh", a festive song from the Bollywood movie Kai Po Che! (2013). Leading up to the big celebration on June 30, the Ambani household has already lit up with two unmissable parties in honour of Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani. On June 27, Priyanka Chopra attended the couple's pre-engagement mehandi celebration and on June 28, everyone from Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan to Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt visited Antilia for the couple's pre-engagement sangeet. Here's a look at some of the most exciting moments from the evening. 
Amongst Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani's three children, Akash Ambani will be the first to tie the knot. And for her eldest son's engagement celebrations, the matriarch went all out last night. Dressed in a deep red lehenga embroidered with decadent gold blooms, Nita Ambani welcomed her many guests with an unforgettable dance performance. Keeping with the theme of the engagement's invite, the mother of the groom presented a classical Indian dance performance to "Shubhaarambh", joined on stage by dancers dressed in pastel lehengas. Ambani wore her lehenga with a layered neckpiece, matching haath phools and jhumkas. 
No Indian wedding celebration is complete without a traditional routine or two. Last night, Isha Ambani officially welcomed Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta to the pre-engagement sangeet with a small aarti. The sister of the bride completed the ritual by sprinkling the couple with holy water (notice how she playfully splashed a little extra on her brother), and gave Shloka a big hug when she tried to touch her feet. 
Just like most Ambani celebrations, this pre-engagement sangeet was loaded with stars. While Alia Bhatt made sure to take a selfie with Ayan Mukerji and Karan Johar from inside the venue, Priyanka Chopra walked into the Ambani's residence hand-in-hand with beau Nick Jonas. Shloka Mehta was also seen playing with a toddler on her way into the celebration, and one of the sweetest pictures from the evening has got to be that of the couple smiling together as they greet their guests. 
There's no missing the fact that pretty pastels have become a favourite with Indian brides recently. Anushka Sharma did her pheras with Virat Kohli in a Sabyasachi lehenga in the soothing hue, and most recently, Neha Dhupia completed her Anand Karaj ceremony in a rosy Anita Dongre lehenga too. After being seen in that gold Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla earlier in the evening, Shloka Mehta changed her sangeet look as the night progressed. Her second pick for the night was an intricately embroidered dusky rose lehenga by Sabyasachi, worn with a shimmering net dupatta and decadent choker. As for Akash Ambani, the groom was first seen in a soft pink kurta, which he then switched for a deep purple sherwani worn with white trousers.

They were spotted at Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani’s pre-engagement sangeet last night 
Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' relationship has been under scrutiny on the internet for a while now. From first being spotted on a yacht together with friends to leaving cute comments on each other's Instagram accounts, the two kept fans guessing about their then-alleged relationship. These rumours were only solidified when Chopra accompanied Jonas to his cousin's wedding earlier this month, and then flew to India with him this week. The couple's first Mumbai outing was a private dinner in BKC with Chopra's mother and a few friends. Then, they took off to a fun Goan vacation with close friends and family, including the Indian actor's mother Madhu Chopra, brother Siddharth and cousin Parineeti Chopra. 
Upon returning to Mumbai, Chopra was seen attending Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's pre-engagement mehandi ceremony by herself this week, followed by a dinner with Jonas and her mother at the Taj Mahal Palace. Of course, speculation was rife about whether we'd see the couple together at the sangeet ceremony last night, and they delivered. Jonas accompanied her—hand-in-hand—to the pre-engagement sangeet ceremony at the Ambani residence, Antilia. Chopra was dressed in a red and silver Abu Jain Sandeep Khosla sari for the event, while Jonas wore a dark blue plaid suit. This was the first time the couple made an appearance together at a public event, and posed for the paparazzi with their arms around each other. The two were last spotted them at the airport early this morning, jetting off on their next adventure.

Take a closer look at the designer lehenga and jewels from the couturier here 
Last evening, business magnate Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani's eldest son Akash Ambani celebrated his union to childhood friend Shloka Mehta with a pre-engagement sangeet in Mumbai. It was a decadent night to say the least—Antilia, the high-rise residence of the Ambani family was flooded with guests who joined in to commemorate the occasion with the families. For the merrymaking, bride-to-be Shloka Mehta was bedecked in couture and jewels that looked like they were plucked straight out of any bride's dream, and entered the party in an ornate gold look by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, accessorised with diamond jewellery. But that wasn't her only look for the evening. Mehta changed into a custom blush pink lehenga by Sabyasachi later, which she wore with a stunning polki set, also by the couturier. 
Turns out we weren't too far from the mark when we guessed what Mehta would wear to her engagement. She has already been seen in Anamika Khanna, Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and Sabyasachi even before the actual engagement ceremony, which takes place tomorrow. Mehta's lehenga of choice for her pre-engagement sangeet strikes as demure, yet elegant, and the blush pink tone complements her understated persona. However, the crowning glory of her ensemble was the stunning jewellery set she chose to wear with it, which was regal to say the least. According to the designer, her lehenga was hand-embroidered with chiffon appliqués, cut-glass beads and zardosi. The custom jewellery set she picked from the Sabyasachi Heritage Jewelry Collection comprised of uncut diamonds, gold and Japanese baroque pearls. 
Mehta and fiancée Akash Ambani posed for the paparazzi parked outside their building as the evening wrapped up. Amongst those who joined in the party were Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan, Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, Sachin and Anjali Tendulkar, among others.

And more from Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani’s party 
If you're in Mumbai today, Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani's engagement is probably the cause of traffic you're stuck in. The much-hyped engagement ceremony of Shloka Mehta, daughter of diamantaires Russell and Mona Mehta, with Akash Ambani, son of Mukesh and Nita Ambani will take place this Saturday. However, the pre-celebrations are in full swing and the families have already hosted a mehandi and sangeet for the couple. 
Needless to say, the city's biggest celebrities, Bollywood and otherwise, are invited to the party. Amongst the first to arrive this evening were Gauri Khan and Shah Rukh Khan. While the actor chose a dapper tuxedo, Gauri Khan picked a navy blue gown by Falguni Shane Peacock for the occasion. The embellishment on the dress made up for the conservative silhouette of the look. And while many might opt brighter colours for the sangeet, Khan's gown made for an elegant choice for the evening. 
The interior decorator styled the gown with a pair of chandelier earrings. As for the beauty look, Khan went with blow dried hair and nude make-up. Amongst other stars seen at the party were Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Karan Johar, Sachin and Anjali Tendulkar, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Anupama Chopra.

When it comes to the Ambanis, size or scale is no object during a celebration. Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement ceremony is slated to take place on Saturday, but before the big day, the family has already been celebrating their union with numerous events for the couple. Last evening was Shloka Mehta's mehandi celebration, following which the family threw a sangeet for the duo. 
Shloka Mehta was spotted in a decadent gold lehenga, outside Antilia with her soon-to-be sister-in-law Isha Ambani. Mehta's choice of a heavily embroidered lehenga by couturiers Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla was an apt one given the guestlist for the evening. Mehta styled her look with a statement diamond necklace, chandelier earrings and a maang tikka. Her dupatta was held in place with a belt studded with diamonds, rubies and emeralds, that added definition to her waistline. The bride's sister Diya Mehta, and sister-in-law Isha Ambani, also picked lehengas by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla for the sangeet; Mehta, a vibrant yellow creation, and Ambani, a pale pink one. 
Bollywood stars and A-listers alike arrived at the party in their sartorial best. Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Gauri and Shah Rukh Khan, Karan Johar, Sachin and Anjali Tendulkar, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Anupama Chopra were amongst the earliest to arrive at the event. The wedding (which is going by the hashtag #akkustoletheshlo) is set to be the biggest of the year. After sporting looks by Anamika Khanna and Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla well before the engagement, one can only imagine what Mehta will choose for the actual ceremony over the weekend. Until then here's a closer look at what the bride-to-be wore to her pre-engagement sangeet.

The rumoured couple has just touched down after their holiday in Goa, but not before Priyanka Chopra updated her Instagram with this very interesting picture 
If you haven't heard of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' rumoured relationship in the last couple of months, you need to write a book about how to do a social media cleanse. This celebrity pair first made headlines when they were each other's date to the Met Gala in 2017, and their frequent public appearances together since May 2018 have fuelled speculation. 
During the last few months, Chopra and Jonas have been observed flirting in each other's Instagram comments, and he has posted a video of her on his Instagram story. However, today, Chopra uploaded a photo of Jonas on her social medium for the very first time, finally deeming this much-discussed ship Instagram-official. Priyanka Chopra's Instagram update from Goa features a photo of Nick Jonas and her brother, Siddharth Chopra, standing side by side in identical poses by the water on a beach, and is captioned, “My Favourite Men.” Chopra took a leaf out of her rumoured beau's book by ending her caption with the heart-eyed emoji. This was before images of them stepping out of Mumbai's private terminal hit the internet. 
Last week, #Nickyanka fans across the globe had a field day when the duo landed in Mumbai, apparently to introduce Jonas to Chopra's family, including her mother, Madhu Chopra. Paparazzi spotted the stars leaving a restaurant in Mumbai, and later that evening, Jonas' Instagram story featured a heartwarming (https://www.vogue.in/content/priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas-in-mumbai-date-night/) as she walked towards him in the rain on the balcony of her Versova bungalow. 
Over the weekend, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas made a quick getaway to the monsoon-soaked beaches of Goa with Chopra's family, including cousin Parineeti Chopra, who posted an adorable video of the sisters dancing and lip-synching to Bollywood's favourite monsoon number, ‘Tip Tip Barsa Pani.' Jonas could be seen in the background while his rumoured girlfriend was enjoying the limelight. A photo of Jonas and the Chopra sisters enjoying a Goan spread with some friends went viral, as it is one of the few images of the couple posing together that has not been taken by a paparazzo. 
This year, amongst their many rendezvous, the Quantico star and Disney heartthrob were sighted spending Memorial Day together, and Chopra was Jonas' plus-one to his cousin's wedding in New Jersey earlier this month, where she met the whole Jonas family.

Crimes against women in India have seen a rise in the last decade 
According to a recent survey led by 550 experts on women issues by The Thomson Reuters Foundation, India is the most dangerous country for women. Basis the study, women in India are not only at a high risk for sexual violence, but also human trafficking—for domestic labour, forced labour, forced marriage and sexual labour, amongst other crimes against basic human rights. “World leaders vowed three years ago to eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls by 2030, allowing them to live freely and safely [and] to participate equally in political, economic and public life. But despite this pledge, it is estimated that one in three women globally experience physical or sexual violence during their lifetime,” the foundation said. “Child marriage is still rife, with almost 750 million women and girls married before their 18th birthday, resulting in teen pregnancies that can put their health at risk and limiting schooling and opportunities.” 
The report also stated that India is one of the worst countries for women for cultural traditions that impact women, the survey reports, with the prevalence of issues such as acid attacks, female genital mutilation, child marriage and physical abuse. According to NDTV, India's Ministry of Women and Child Development declined to comment on the survey results. 
The report rings true in light of the many recent high-profile rape and murder cases. Jyoti Singh Pandey's gang rape in 2012 enraged the nation, as did the recent unrelated gang rapes of two minors. But after a heated few weeks of headlines, loud, angry news hour shows, and enrage on social media, the attention shifts focus to more palatable news. "India has shown utter disregard and disrespect for women ... rape, marital rapes, sexual assault and harassment, female infanticide has gone unabated," said Manjunath Gangadhara, a Karnataka government official, in response to the survey. 
India is joined by Afghanistan and Syria in the second and third ranks of the report. Due to the #MeToo uprising, the United States joined the list—the only western nation in the top 10 most dangerous countries for women. 
The survey included inputs from aid professionals, academics, healthcare staff, non-government organisation workers, policy-makers, development specialists and social commentators. The poll of 548 people was conducted online, by phone and in person between March 26 and May 4 with an even spread across Europe, Africa, the Americas, South East Asia, South Asia and the Pacific.

Featuring Kareena Kapoor Khan and the rest of the family 
Celebrity birthdays tend to be synonymous with extravagant bashes, featuring uninhibited revelry and star-studded guest lists—but Karisma Kapoor didn't follow the norm this time. On the occasion of her 44th birthday yesterday, Kapoor chose to have a low-key celebration in London, where she has been holidaying for the past couple of weeks. 
Surrounded by her children Samiera and Kiaan, mother Babita, sister Kareena Kapoor Khan, brother-in-law Saif Ali Khan, and nephew Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, the actor chose to have an intimate picnic in the park. Notably missing from the family photos on her Instagram page was her father Randhir Kapoor, to whom she posted a sweet shoutout in her caption, “#Papa missed you.” For her special day, Kapoor forwent a decadent birthday cake, in favour of a colourful selection of Lola's Cupcakes. 
In case you missed it, the Kapoor sisters have been on a twinning streak this holiday. Just five days ago, they were spotted on a shopping excursion in central London carrying matching black Balenciaga sling bags and donning matching sunglasses. Continuing this tradition, they were spotted casually sporting matching straw hats at the birthday picnic. 
Karisma Kapoor made sure to give her fans a glimpse into her big day with several photos, including one of herself lounging on a sofa with Kareena Kapoor Khan in a post-picnic daze. The siblings swapped their relaxed street style looks for elegant dresses later in the day. 
Over the past week, Karisma Kapoor has been having a ball in London with her favourite people. The star was spotted enjoying a Sunday brunch with Kapoor Khan, Sonam K Ahuja and Natasha Poonawalla this weekend, the latter of whom posted touching birthday messages and photos for Kapoor on their personal social media accounts. Missed out on all the action? Catch up on everything Karisma Kapoor and her crew have been up to in the slideshow now.

Dancing in the rain, and snooze-inducing feasts 
Priyanka Chopra has left no stone unturned in making rumoured beau Nick Jonas' whirlwind holiday to India as exciting as it can be. The pair has been at the centre of dating rumours since they attended the Met Gala together in 2017, and have been frequently photographed together over the past couple of months. They even spent Memorial Day together, and the Hollywood heartthrob introduced Chopra to the whole Jonas clan when he took her to his cousin's wedding in New Jersey as his plus-one, adding fuel to the fire. 
Most recently, shutterbugs spotted the couple in Mumbai—Chopra may have returned the favour by introducing Jonas to her mother Madhu Chopra for the first time, suggesting that they are no longer being coy about their relationship status. The Jonas brother even posted a video on his Instagram story of the Quantico star dancing in the rain at her Versova bungalow, punctuating his caption with the heart-eyed emoji. Now it looks like the two are taking things to the next level, as this weekend, they jetted off from Mumbai's metropolitan jungle to the beaches of Goa with Chopra's family, including her cousin, actor Parineeti Chopra. 
Goa's romantic, rainy vibe right now, paired with the excitement of spending some much-needed down-time with family, have made for some captivating celebrity videos—Parineeti Chopra shared one on her Instagram feed that had the Chopra cousins dancing to the quintessential Bollywood monsoon number, 'Tip Tip Barsa Pani'. Eagle-eyed fans had a field day when they spotted Jonas in the background, while the sisters basked in the limelight. A photo of the group enjoying a huge Goan feast has gone viral too, as it is one of the few images that features the couple, and has not been taken by a paparazzo. Have a look at all that's happened to date in the slideshow below.

A night to remember 
On June 24 this year, Bangkok played host to the 2018 edition of the IIFA Awards, after seeing some of Bollywood's coolest stars walk the green carpet in unmissable ensembles at IIFA Rocks just the day before. As is the norm, IIFA's celebrity guests went all out with their evening looks for the main event too, which was attended by everyone from Shraddha Kapoor, Varun Dhawan, Nushrat Bharucha and Kriti Sanon to Dia Mirza and Sanju co-star Ranbir Kapoor. Rekha, who had an onstage performance slotted for later in the evening, walked the green carpet in a heavily embellished ivory sari, while the other Bollywood ladies present at the event opted for stunning evening gowns. Here's a look at what your favourite stars wore. 
After attending IIFA Rocks in that midnight sky-inspired Reem Acra number, Shraddha Kapoor went down the feminine route at IIFA 2018. The actor kicked off the evening in another Reem Acra gown—this time in shades of baby pink and deep red, one of spring/summer 2018's biggest trends. Kapoor wore the pretty number with minimal accessories, and pulled her locks back into a bun to let her glowing skin be the focus. 
This year, Kriti Sanon had a major fairy tale moment on the green carpet with her voluminous icy blue gown—the shimmering off-shoulder Mark Bumgarner creation had the actor twirling for cameras all along. To amp up her IIFA 2018 look, Sanon opted for chunky rings and gold hoops, and finished off with a low ponytail, subtle smoky eyes and pink lipstick. 
Kriti Sanon wasn't the only Bollywood lady to show baby blue lots of love this year. Another star to be seen sporting the soothing hue last night was Dia Mirza. After walking the green carpet at IIFA Rocks in an edgy green mini, Mirza stepped out in a strappy pastel maxi for the main event. The intricate embellishment all over the bodice made sure the outfit stood out among the rest. Unlike Shraddha Kapoor and Kriti Sanon, Mirza chose soft waves and deep red lips to complete her look for the night. 
Among the men, everyone from Anil Kapoor and Kartik Aaryan to Varun Dhawan, Ranbir Kapoor and Riteish Deshmukh went with classic suits. While Arjun Kapoor added a pop of colour to his suit with a purple, green and yellow scarf, Ayushmann Khurrana changed things up with a white blazer, and host for the evening Karan Johar worked a decadent gold blazer flawlessly. Take a closer look at who wore what at IIFA Awards 2018 via our slideshow below.

Everything you missed 
The IIFA Awards are always a special affair, because of their penchant for bringing some of Bollywood's biggest celebrities together in a new spot around the world each time. This year, the IIFA Awards returned to Bangkok after a decade, and the IIFA weekend was full of unmissable Bollywood moments. The annual event's 19th edition boasted an extensive guest list including the likes of Ranbir Kapoor, Kriti Sanon, Arjun Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Anil Kapoor, Karan Johar, Diana Penty, Rekha, Radhika Apte, Ayushmann Khurrana, Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha, among many others. 
With so many stars together in the same city, it was no surprise that IIFA was full of unmissable celebrity moments. You've already seen what everyone wore for IIFA Rocks and the main IIFA Awards, but you may have missed out on Bollywood's best candid moments, both on and off stage. Well, get updated now. 
The IIFA Awards may have just come to a close, but everyone's social media feeds are already loading up with unseen images from inside Siam Niramit, this year's venue. Some of the best from the evening include a beaming Kriti Sanon bagging her Style Icon of the Year Award, and Anupam Kher giving a heartfelt speech as he accepted his Lifetime Achievement Award. The late Sridevi also (posthumously) won her last IIFA ever this year. Joined by Arjun Kapoor on stage, Boney Kapoor accepted the Best Actor Female Award on behalf of his wife for her performance in Mom. 
The highlight of the evening, however, had to be its closing show. After years of being away from the stage, Rekha brought IIFA 2018 to an end with a stunning performance that earned her a standing ovation. Who else performed last night? The list included Ranbir Kapoor, Kriti Sanon, Shraddha Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor. 
The IIFA weekend also gave it's celebrity attendees a chance to use their free time to catch up with one another. While Karan Johar shared a picture perfect shot of Ranbir Kapoor, Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor, Riteish Deshmukh and Kunal Rawal posing for him (don't miss the caption, it's a nod to the iconic Hollywood film Ocean's 11), Shraddha Kapoor made sure to get a party-ready selfie with the boys, and Diana Penty spent some quality time alone treating herself to desserts. In case you missed it, Dia Mirza's highlight of the weekend was bidding on and winning a poster of the Bollywood classic Mother India. The star, who will soon be seen in Sanju, will be gifting it to Sanjay Dutt as a token of her appreciation.

More fashion and beauty confessions here 
The IIFA Awards bring together some of Bollywood's coolest stars each year. The awards ceremony is on its 19th leg this year, and has garnered loyalists like Dia Mirza and Anil Kapoor over time, who have become IIFA regulars. Every passing year gives actors who have never attended before a chance to join the IIFA family too; and this year marked Diana Penty's first ever IIFA experience. “I've got no sleep at all, but it's been really fun! In all these years, I've never been for IIFA before... so I was really excited to be here after all I've heard!" she says. The actor didn't just attend IIFA Rocks, she also walked the ramp during the event in a Vikram Phadnis ensemble (“One of the reasons I wasn't nervous was because I was walking in flat shoes, so I knew the chances of slipping and tripping have been reduced to almost none.”) Before hopping onto her flight out of Bangkok, the star sat down with Vogue to reveal some fashion and beauty facts about her that you didn't know yet. Read the best moments here and scroll to watch the complete interview. 
Honestly, I'm very minimal with everything including my various regimes and routines. People say what do you do for this, and what do you do for that, and I say nothing, because honestly I'm very fuss free. For my hair it's just the usual shampoo and conditioning. My hair needs a lot of conditioning, because I have an oily scalp but my ends are really dry, so I tend to condition only towards the ends. other than that, I really don't do anything. Maybe once in a while at the salon if I have time to kill, I'll do one of those hair spa things, but that doesn't happen really often. 
Lip balm—I feel like I use a lot of it, I can't do without it. Kohl—I'm a true Indian when it comes to kohl; I love using it on my eyes, and I just use it around my eyes and smudge it out. I can go anywhere with just kohl. And the third thing would be an eyelash curler, because it kind of just opens my eyes up. 
I'm not much of a fan of a lot of colour on the eyes. I like browns, blacks and deeper colours, but I've never been a fan of pop colours around the eyes, especially pink. I've always stayed away from that and if it ever becomes a big trend... maybe not for me. Avoidable! 
Whether I'm on holiday or not, I'm always about comfort, that's always been my thing. And I feel it's important, because it also transforms the way you present yourself. If you're comfortable in what you're wearing it will show, so there's no point being uncomfortable just to make a statement. Especially if it's a day out, or you're travelling... you don't want to be uncomfortable on an eight hour flight. I usually do boyfriend jeans, or anything that's not too tight, or tracks. I love track pants, [and] leggings, but you obviously make it look current while you're at it. 
I'm not much of an accessories person [either]... I really like them and I have a ton at home, but I've realised when it actually comes to getting ready, I forget. I literally forget to put on my accessories before I step out and then when I'm in the car I'm like, “I forgot to put on earrings! It just slips my mind and I don't know why. But I'm really into hoops these days, large, statement ones. 
Firstly, all the clutches that I have don't hold much. My phone doesn't fit in my clutches, it's just bizarre! Apple needs to make smaller phones so they can go into evening bags. Usually my phone is outside my clutch... But what's in it is a puff, because there are all these lights, and it just gets really hot and you don't want to be oily; a lipstick and my credit cards.

2018’s edition of IIFA kicked off last night with the IIFA Rocks event. Here are all the looks from the green carpet you need check out 
Every year, the IIFA Awards bring some of the biggest stars in the Indian film industry together to celebrate the best in their business. The annual awards weekend takes place in different cities each time—New York last year, Madrid in 2016—and this time, the venue is in Bangkok, Thailand. Prior to the main awards ceremony, however, is the IIFA Rocks evening, with its star studded green carpet. Bollywood stepped out in their most experimental and interesting ensembles for this event, just like every year before this. The exciting guest list included everyone from Shraddha Kapoor and Kriti Sanon to Arjun Kapoor and Varun Dhawan, along with Dia Mirza, Anil Kapoor, Diana Penty, Karan Johar, Radhika Apte, Bobby Deol, Konkona Sen Sharma, Iulia Vantur, and the hosts for the evening, Kartik Aaryan and Ayushmann Khurrana. Here's a look at what your favourite celebrities wore on June 23. 
Dia Mirza is seen walking red carpets in pretty pastel anarkalis more often than not. When the star does pick Western silhouettes, breezy dresses are usually the pick. For IIFA Rocks 2018, however, Dia Mirza tried something very different from her usual aesthetic. Accompanied by husband Sahil Sangha, Dia Mirza walked the green carpet in an emerald green sequinned mini. The eye-catching Monisha Jaising party dress was worn with glittering statement earrings and strappy heels, and topped off with a super sleek hairdo. 
Unlike Dia Mirza, Shraddha Kapoor went the girly route for IIFA Rocks 2018 in a navy blue Reem Acra gown that seems to have been inspired by the night sky. Embroidered with sparkling silver stars and moons, the layered sheer number was equal parts romantic and whimsical. With a dress like that, Kapoor couldn't help but do a few twirls for the camera. 
  
For Kriti Sanon, IIFA Rocks 2018 was all about bringing some drama to the green carpet. After being seen in a body-hugging white number earlier the same day, the actor stepped out last night in a heavily embellished Gaurav Gupta gown in a buttery hue. In true Gupta style, the gown featured interesting layers and unpredictable sheer panels, all of which came together to create a theatrical effect. The Raabta actor complemented her look with a dark matte lip.

Did you see Jonas' sweet Instagram story? 
The hottest new couple on the charts, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are no longer being coy about their relationship status. The duo is in India—perhaps to spend some time with Priyanka Chopra's family after having spent time with the Jonases at the wedding in New Jersey a few weeks ago. The actor and singer-song writer headed out for dinner in Mumbai and were spotted at BKC after their meal together. 
Dressing for the monsoon keeping in check the humidity factor and managing to look something akin of alluring to your partner can be a bit of a task. Chopra chose a checkered skirt and a crop top for the occasion (get yours here and here). The coordinated separates were not only playful, revealed a tasteful bit of skin but also looked comfortable. The Quantico star was not without a mini Jason Stavley handbag by her side and a pair of thin hoop earrings (click here for a pair like hers). Jonas on the other hand wore a pale yellow T-shirt and khaki trousers. 
Are you truly from Mumbai if the monsoon that irks everyone else secretly brings you joy? The freshly-minted couple's first date in India seemed to have gone well, because it didn't just end at dinner. The duo continued the night on Chopra's terrace at her home in Versova, where they took turns getting wet in the rain as seen on Nick Jonas's Instagram Stories. If that's not a quintessential Bollywood romance move, we don't know what is.

Streetwear, athleisure and now? 
Dior Homme's much-awaited spring/summer 2019 show is slated to take place today, much to the excitement of their dedicated, fashion-forward following across the globe. But this show is a special one, as it marks the debut of Kim Jones, the luxury brand's new creative director. Jones, who was previously the style director at Louis Vuitton, was best known for reinventing the menswear scene at the French luxury label, and giving the world ground-breaking collaborations like the one with Supreme, prior to joining Dior.

Jones was widely commended for his ability to usher in new trends while maintaining the identity of the brand, and its original appeal to customers. 
Perhaps it is his nomadic childhood that inspires his eclectic taste in fashion, or his fair, no-nonsense attitude, that leads to his designs being so successful. Whichever it may be, the fashion world cannot wait for his debut. Watch the live streaming of the show here.

Fashion speaks louder than words 
While 2,500 odd children are languishing in detention centres in the United States, mercilessly torn apart from their loved ones, Melania Trump, First Lady of the United States, a woman so impeccably and fashionably ‘curated', a woman who wouldn't dare step out of her house without looking like “she smells like vanilla” (a phrase coined by Teen Vogue's Lauren Duca about Ivanka Trump in 2016), decided to be go tone-deaf. While visiting children in ‘prisons', she wore a jacket with this loaded slogan—“I really don't care do u?”—splashed across the coat that would make Stephen Sprouse balk at its audacity. 
This just goes to show how busy Melania is, paddling in an ocean of self-importance and how her reality TV husband-President Trump has abetted a government of connivance and gaslighting not just America, but the whole world. Now she's feigning she doesn't understand the significance of her clothing choice? Isn't this the same woman who wore stilettos to pay condolences to storm ravaged victims in Texas? Come on. Once bitten, twice shy. 
When Stephanie Grisham, Melania Trump's spokesperson piped in “It's a jacket…I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,” I thought—too late sister. In case you didn't read the memo, circa 2018, clothes are a force of political expression. And which side of the political and social spectrum you stand on is displayed day after day via clothes in mainstream and social media—in rallies for LGBTQ rights, women's rights, climate change, gun control, etc, and now at the uproar against zero tolerance. Today, people—especially the youth—wear their hearts on their sleeve (literally), so to dismiss the incident with #ItsJustAJacket by the Trump team, is downright reductionist and smacks of superficial concern for the pains of ordinary men, women and children. It smacks of your disregard for the importance of clothing. 
This is a reminder why we should indeed take our clothes seriously. To understand the significance of your clothes—not couture dresses, but humble, everyday clothes like T-shirt or jackets—dig into the archives of February 2018 exhibition at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London, T-Shirt: Cult - Culture - Subversion, which traces the journey of clothes as political tools and the role clothes have played to announce, empower and facilitate paradigm shifts—social, political and cultural. Today, what we wear on our body is a sartorial affirmation of our inner beliefs. Ask an eco-warrior what it means to wear eco-friendly clothes or ask a gay-bashing Neo-Nazi why there's a brazen swastika on his bomber, and you'll get into the heart of their beliefs. Clothes are indeed our second skin, today more than ever before. They are the billboards of our life choices. So it's not "just a jacket"; it is symptomatic of a lack of empathy for those less-privileged than you, and reeks of ignorance of the power of individual choices. In today's hyper-digital world, no matter which far-flung country or culture you come from, the common cues people respond to, virtually rally for or against, are those that have visual significance. And clothes are on top of the heap. 
We now live in a world where Christian Dior's first female designer doesn't hesitate to announce her feministic ideals on the ramp at Paris Fashion Week, where mega-hipster labels like Public School sell election-inspired merchandise. Prabal Gurung opened his spring/summer 2018 show in New York Fashion Week with “Grant me the strength to change the things I cannot accept.” And there are hundreds of similar examples to give—bold expressions to be on the right side of history. Today, fashion has an unwavering commitment (and gumption) to stand up for, or stand up against the causes that will change the course of history, however difficult. 
So Melania Trump should acknowledge that her display of this level of ignorance, makes her complicit to the atrocities of her husband's government. And her choice of clothes were a dead giveaway.

Here's what we know so far 
You probably know that Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' alleged relationship has been taking the world by storm. Neither are strangers to making headlines, and rumours of their romance have been circulating the grapevine ever since the two attended the Met Gala together in 2017. Over the past few weeks, Jonas and Chopra have been photographed with each other frequently—they were spotted spending Memorial Day together, and then again at the Beauty and the Beast Live concert. We've observed some serious flirting going down in their Instagram comments too. 
Now, it looks like the rumoured couple is taking their relationship to the next level. Word around the gossip mill is that Nick Jonas just touched down in Mumbai to meet Priyanka Chopra's mother, Madhu Chopra. Considering the actor recently met Jonas' family at his cousin's wedding in Atlantic City, New Jersey, this trip may be indicative of a relationship that is going quite strong. 
Chopra was photographed leaving Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in her car, and it appears that Nick Jonas was seated beside her, albeit behind a black curtain. The couple has never shied away from the shutterbugs at any of their previous outings, so the covert nature of their exit from the airport begs the question: Why are they hiding from the paparazzi this time? 
In other news, it was announced recently that the 35-year old actor will pen an autobiography, titled Unfinished, and will be making her next appearance on the silver screen in Ali Abbas Zafar's Bharat, with Salman Khan. The movie is said to mark her return to mainstream Bollywood cinema after Quantico. She was also the closing keynote speaker, along with PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, at the recent Forbes Summit 2018 in New York. Who said you can't have it all?

With the big engagement bash right around the corner, word is that the Bollywood superstar will be seen performing a dance number for the couple 
In case you didn't know this already, Mukesh and Nita Ambani's oldest child, Akash Ambani recently proposed to his long-time girlfriend and close friend Shloka Mehta, and the couple's official engagement ceremony will take place on June 30, 2018 at the Ambani's Altamount Road residence in Mumbai—Antilia. While this is exciting news by itself, the grapevine is buzzing with the news of what's in store for the night. While there is no confirmation yet, rumour has it that Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan will be present at the function, and not just as a guest. According to reports, that the actor be not only be hosting the evening, he will also give a special performance at the ceremony. Khan is often spotted spending time with the Ambanis at social gatherings and their parties, and is a close friend of the family. 
Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta were engaged in a private lawn ceremony in Goa, when he popped the question on March 25, 2018. They were surrounded by their closest family members, including Akash's parents Mukesh and Nita Ambani, siblings Anant and Isha Ambani, and grandmother Kokilaben Ambani. Just days after returning from Goa, the Ambanis hosted a celebratory evening at their lavish Mumbai residence, which saw a number of Bollywood celebrities in attendance, along with the family's close friends. 
As is the case with all Ambani parties, it is safe to expect this engagement ceremony is going to be nothing short of spectacular. The night will mostly likely to be attended by their friends in Bollywood and cricketers too. The Bachchans, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Katrina Kaif, Karan Johar, Aamir Khan, Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan are just a few of the people that you may spot on the night.

There's nothing this Bollywood actor can't do 
It's almost impossible for an entire day to go by without Priyanka Chopra making headlines. Since her small screen debut on Quantico, she took over the world of American television (and hearts worldwide) while maintaining her status in Bollywood. As if world domination wasn't enough, Chopra will now be taking on the role of an author, with an autobiography titled Unfinished. 
Recently, Penguin India announced their plans to publish Chopra's memoir, and the purpose of the book, according to the 35-year-old actor, is to inspire women. The days of submissive women who were made to listen to someone else on matters of what they can do and what they can't, are long gone. Knowing the power and influence she has, the feminist activist and global star is using her position to motivate women from all walks of life to break the stereotype and show the world what they're worth. Unfinished will tell women all over that they too can “shatter glass ceilings” and conquer their dreams, and reminds them to be aware of their true worth. 
According to Chopra, who began her career by winning Miss World at the mere age of 17, the book will be a representation of her “honest, funny, spirited, bold and rebellious” personality. She explains that this is the first time that she is ready to speak about her journey—which hasn't always been the smoothest, but has undoubtedly been a successful one. 
Unfinished will hit stands in 2019, the same year when Priyanka will come back to Bollywood with Ali Abbas Zafar's Bharat, starring opposite Salman Khan.

In a time when one can be an star with little more than an Instagram account, what does it take to achieve true celebrity status? Trophies, controversies, high-profile relationships, and an incredible drive that’s taken her from pageant girl to global idol: Priyanka Chopra has all the trappings of an international icon 
Priyanka Chopra is the definition of the self-made modern woman. Originally from Jamshedpur, she had no background or connections in the film industry when she entered with a Miss World crown on her head. Today, she's a household name in Bollywood, and has been taking Hollywood by storm over the recent years. With 50-plus Bollywood movies, an American TV show, a couple of Hollywood films (and another in the pipeline), three hit record singles and multiple awards to her name (and now, Chopra will soon turn author with an autobiography), the star is the perfect example of a crossover success story. But what goes into the making of an actor-singer-philanthropist-style icon? We found out. 
The elder child and only daughter of Ashok and Madhu Chopra, Priyanka was raised in a humble family of four (her brother Siddharth is seven years her junior). Both her parents were physicians in the Indian army, and owing to their profession, Chopra found herself travelling throughout her childhood years—from Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, to Bareilly, Ladakh and even Pune. She stayed with her aunt in the US for three years as a teenager, but came back to India to finish her education. She entered the modelling industry soon after, and participated in the Miss India beauty pageant. 
An aeronautical engineering aspirant, 17-year-old Chopra enrolled her name as a contestant in Miss India 2000. Her sharp personality and earnest views won the crowd and jury over, and she became a frontrunner in the contest along with Lara Dutta and Dia Mirza. She was crowned the first runner-up and went on to participate in—and eventually win—the Miss World beauty pageant in 2000. 
Chopra was to debut with the 2002 thriller Humraaz, alongside Bobby Deol and Akshaye Khanna, but her schedule did not permit her to take up the opportunity. Not many know this, but the actor actually made her film debut with Tamil movie, Thamizhan (2002) opposite Tamilian actor, Vijay. 
A year down the line, Priyanka made it to Bollywood with the release of the 2003 spy thriller The Hero: Love Story of a Spy. The then-debutant was seen alongside Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta in the film, and gained critical acclaim with her performance. She then went on to star in blockbusters like Aitraaz (2004), Bluffmaster (2005) and Don (2006). 
Her streak of box office hits suffered a few setbacks in the years of 2007 and 2008, when projects like Love Story 2050 and Big Brother did not perform well. But the actor made a strong comeback with Madhur Bhandarkar's Fashion (2008), and her stellar performance proved to her peers that she was here to stay. The film won her various awards along with positive reviews across the board. In the recent years, Priyanka Chopra has been a part of many commercial and critical successes with movies such as Mary Kom (2014), Dil Dhadakne Do (2015) and Bajirao Mastani (2015). 
Chopra's first exposure to the international market was with her 2012 music video “In My City ft. will.i.am”, but she truly gained popularity when she bagged the role of Alex Parrish in the ABC thriller Quantico. Soon enough, she had caught the attention of international critics. James Poniewozik of the New York Times called her the “strongest human asset” of the show. 
Other international milestones in Chopra's life include being featured on TIME's 100 Most Influential People list in 2016, and her role in the 2017 comedy action film, Baywatch—the film had her starring alongside big league names like Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and David Hasselhoff. Though the movie didn't rack up critical applause, it did launch Chopra on a global scale. She was also seen making appearances on popular American talk shows such as the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Ellen Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live. 
In the middle of all of this (let's face it; she does a lot in a short span of time), Chopra was also indulging in her newly-found music habit. Alongside her acting career, Priyanka has released four music videos over the years, two of them with popular rappers will.i.am and Pitbull. 
Though the actor many accolades for her work in the American series, she recently found herself amidst a controversy when people lashed out at Chopra for the show's depiction of Indian nationalists as terrorists. The plot of the controversial episode referenced the longstanding Kashmir issue, to which many raised objections. However, many came to Chopra's defence on social media, stating that she had no control over the progression of the plot, or the direction of the show. 
With the title of international star comes a wardrobe overhaul, and Chopra—with help from a few of the best names in the fashion business—rose to the occasion. Chopra was one of the first Indian actors to ever be invited to the exclusive Met Gala in 2017, along with Deepika Padukone. On a red carpet specifically known for its theatrics, Chopra walked in with her now-rumoured boyfriend Nick Jonas, in a Ralph Lauren trench coat-inspired gown—featuring an elaborate train that became theme of the many internet memes that cropped up in the days that followed. 
Priyanka Chopra attended the Met Gala the following year too. This time around, the actor arrived in another Ralph Lauren gown, elevating it with an embellished headgear that was right on the dress code. 
Other red carpet moments of note were the TIME 100 Gala in 2016, Oscars 2016 and 2017, and People's Choice Awards 2016 and 2017 (she took home trophies both years).

How Priyanka Chopra conquered red carpets around the world 
Chopra might be the first to open up about world issues, but so far, she's kept her personal life under wraps. Although she's been linked to a fair number of Bollywood stars, she's never confirmed anything, and has always kept us guessing about her significant other. 
One of her alleged beaus was Harman Baweja, her co-star from Love Story 2050 (2008), but the relationship was short-lived. Chopra was also said to be dating Shahid Kapoor, who worked with her in Kaminey (2009) and Teri Meri Kahaani (2012). 
Since the rumours about her and Kapoor died down, Chopra found a way to stay out of the gossip circles until very recently, when she was spotted with former Disney star and singer, Nick Jonas. The couple were spotted spending Memorial Day, and attending the Beauty and the Beast Live concert together. While we're still waiting for an official confirmation from either parties, the couple seems pretty comfortable being shot by paparazzi, and are not holding back on the Instagram PDA either. Chopra was seen on Jonas' arm as his date for a wedding in the singer's family, where she probably might have met his parents too. 
In return, Nick Jonas flew down to Mumbai and met her mother, Madhu Chopra, after which the two spent a rainy evening on Priyanka's Versova home terrace. Jonas also accompanied the Indian actor on a trip to Goa with some of her family and friends, and from Priyanka Chopra's updates from there, the relationship looks like it's Instagram-official, at the very least. 
In July 2018, Jonas had a Tiffany store in New York shut down allegedly to pick out a ring, and Chopra has stepped down from her latest Bollywood project, giving rise to speculations that the couple might actually be engaged. Fans have been watching eagle-eyed for an update that may help confirm this rumour, and in a recent picture posted by Raveena Tandon, they may have gotten a peek at what many believe is The Ring.

The evolution of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas’s relationship so far 
In 2016, Chopra shot a video with Buzzfeed where they interviewed her while she played with rescue puppies. And being a fervent animal lover, the actor actually decided to take one of them home. Christened Diana Chopra, the puppy now has her own Instagram account called @diariesofdiana, which has 65K-plus followers and counting. The profile is an account of Diana's day in her own perspective, and if you're a follower, you'll get a glimpse of the pup's fabulous life in New York, which includes accompanying mommy Priyanka Chopra on TV show sets, chilling by the poolside, and relaxing in her cosy NYC loft.

Priyanka Chopra and Diana Chopra 
Both independent women fighting against social injustice, Meghan Markle and Priyanka Chopra first met at a dinner event. According to what Chopra told People magazine, they both “bonded over being actors and became friends, like two girls would”. Markle reciprocated by telling PTI, “And you know when you meet someone and you just click...it was an easy, natural progression.” 
This unexpected friendship has been closely followed by fans of both ever since. This year, the Suits star was on TIME's 100 Most Influential People list, and this achievement was commemorated by Chopra in a heartfelt note she penned for the occasion. “Somewhere among biryani, poutine, and endless conversations,” she wrote, “I realised just how deeply Meghan Markle cares for the world…” 
At Markle's highly publicised wedding with the British Royal Family's Prince Harry this year, Chopra was present as a guest along with other Suits co-stars. To mark the occasion, the actor took to social media to celebrate her friend's nuptials by posting an Instagram picture with a moving caption. 
Anyone who knows about Priyanka Chopra knows that she is a vocal feminist. The actor has always been an advocate of gender equality and education of the girl child. Not limiting herself to just speech, Chopra has been working with the UNICEF for 12 years, participating in media panel discussions and public service announcements promoting children's rights. She was also appointed UNICEF's National Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights in 2010, and by 2016, she was made the International Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights. 
In 2017, Chopra travelled to Jordan to meet the Syrian children who had been affected by the conflict, and their families. She learned about the various struggles they face on a daily basis first hand, and opened up the crisis to a larger audience through her Instagram updates. She also made a visit to Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh recently, heading to one of the largest refugee camps in the world to meet with Rohingya Muslims who had faced horrifying brutalities, and been displaced out of force. 
Apart from UNICEF, Chopra is actively engaged in social work with various other organisations as well. She supports environmental charities and is the brand ambassador of NDTV Greenathon, an initiative providing solar power to rural areas that do not have electrical supplies. She also supports the Indian government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and various operations by PETA. 
Good work is never left unacknowledged, and Priyanka Chopra's wall of achievements is proof of this. Here are some of Priyanka Chopra's biggest wins: 
2004: Stardust Awards: Best Supporting Actress for The Hero: Love Story of a Spy 
2005: Screen Awards: Best Actor in a Negative Role for Aitraaz

The sweetest pictures you'll see today 
In today's digital times, no occasion feels complete until you've got a social media post to go with it, and Father's Day 2018 was no different. This June 17, Instagram feeds all over the world brimmed with adorable pictures of people with their dads, and Bollywood's posts for the special day were amongst the cutest of them all. From Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Alia Bhatt to Janhvi Kapoor and Shah Rukh Khan, almost everyone from the industry celebrated the day with heartfelt social media posts. Here's a peek at some of the best from the weekend. 
For many celebrities this year, Father's Day brought the perfect occasion to share throwback pictures. While Alia Bhatt, Parineeti Chopra and Aditi Rao Hydari wished their fathers with adorable snapshots of themselves as toddlers with their dads, Janhvi Kapoor showed her father some love by sharing a black and white image of Boney Kapoor on the sets of a film with her mother, the late Sridevi. Karan Johar posted his picture for father Yash Johar saying, “He taught me the strength of goddness… the overemphasis on success and even the positives of failure… I miss seeing hi but I talk to him everyday! He is my morning prayer.” 
Among the many Father's Day posts that Bollywood put up this year, Anushka Sharma and Neha Dhupia's were amongst the most special. Both actors wished their fathers on the big day with unseen images from their recent weddings. While Sharma's was a black and white from her engagement party, Dhupia's was a happy group photo from her intimate mehandi ceremony. 
Bollywood's kids weren't the only ones who took to their social media pages to celebrate Father's Day this year.

In two recent videos Deepika Padukone shot for American publications Allure and Vanity Fair, the Bollywood star decodes some common Hindi slang phrases, tries playing badminton in heels, and tries her hand at making a self-portrait. Check them out 
The 2017 movie xXx: Return of Xander Cage, made Deepika Padukone just as popular in Hollywood as she is back home. And she has been turning heads at various red carpet events around the world ever since, as well as getting featured on global magazine covers. She was even invited to attend the prestigious Met Gala for two years in a row—in 2017, and again this year. With all her recent engagements, you'd expect Padukone to deem her plate too full, but it doesn't look like the star has plans to stop any time soon. 
While the grapevine is buzzing with rumours of her upcoming wedding with Ranveer Singh, she is spending all her time working. Recently, we spotted her in two videos—one by Vanity Fair and the other by Allure. If you're a fan, these videos will give you an insight into her personality that you might not have had before. Check out all that she gets up to. 
As a popular representative of India in the West, Deepika Padukone was asked to explain the meaning of several Hindi slang words on Vanity Fair's latest video. Explaining phrases such as “waat lag gayi” and “kabab mein haddi”, Padukone gave the audience a taste of the colloquial language used in the country. 
For Allure, Padukone stepped up to the plate and tried nine things that she's never done before. The video shows her trying to talk after inhaling helium through a ballon—cue Chip's (or Dale's) squeaky chipmunk voice—attempting the moonwalk in moon shoes, and applying makeup on a stranger while blindfolded. The results are hilarious, and will leave you in splits. 
  
As the daughter of veteran badminton player Prakash Padukone, Deepika Padukone is no stranger to the sport—she has played it on the National level in the past too. But playing in heels? No one had seen her attempt that yet—until now. Padukone put on a pair of stilettos and played badminton for Allure's video, and did a surprisingly decent job. Turns out, there's not much this actor can't do.

No maths in their chemistry 
Some became friends on movie sets, while others hit it off during larger-than-life red carpet events, but none of these celebrity couples (rumoured and official) have let the number of birthdays they've individually celebrated come in the way of their feelings towards one another. They may have age gaps between them that are larger than what the norm is, but they prove that chemistry (the romantic kind) takes no heed of numbers. Here are seven of the most popular Bollywood and Hollywood couples who prove you don't need to be the same age to be compatible. 
Unless you've been in hibernation, you could not have missed all the talk surrounding Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor's relationship. When he finally spilled the beans in an interview with GQ, fans could not stop talking about them, not just because of their star status, but also because of the obvious age gap—the couple has 10 years between them (Kapoor is 35 and Bhatt, 25). 
They're one of the hottest new—albeit rumoured—couple in town. Though Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra are yet to confirm their relationship status, fans worldwide have been shipping them from the get go. Chopra and Jonas were first seen together on the steps of the Met Gala in 2017, and have been spotted hanging out multiple times since. Their 10-year age difference did invite a few jokes on Jimmy Kimmel's talk show, when word first got out, but Chopra brushed it off easily, jesting “I didn't ask his age. Eleven?” In recent times, the couple seems to be getting serious—they've been commenting on each other's Instagrams, hanging out almost every other day, and Chopra was seen on Jonas' arm as his date to his cousin's wedding too! 
Arguably the most powerful couple in the music industry, Beyoncé, 36, and Jay-Z, 48, have been going strong for a decade now. The couple had made their then-budding relationship official at the 2004 VMAs, when they walked in at the event hand-in-hand. The couple with a 12-year age difference shares three kids—a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, and twins Rumi and Sir Carter—along with multiple chart-topping records. 
The news of 35-year-old Shahid Kapoor getting married to a young 21-year-old Mira Rajput was all people could talk about when it happened in 2015. The couple, who live in their seaside Mumbai home with one-year-old daughter Misha (and have another child on the way), have not let the 14 years between them come in the way of a loving and supportive relationship. 
Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan's chemistry in 2009's Kurbaan had turned quite a few heads in the audience. Since they made their relationship official, fans have tracked its every turn, from dating and marriage to becoming parents to the country's most adored toddler, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. Though the couple is 10 years apart, they have always portrayed their age gap as an asset. Khan is the older one in the relationship at 47, but Kapoor Khan, 37, claims to be the mature one between them. “If Saif and I are both in a bad mood, then I have to be the mature one, even though he is 10 years older.” 
While you've definitely seen and laughed at their banter online—their Twitter conversations are hilarious—we bet you didn't know that Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are actually 11 years apart in age. The couple met on the sets of Green Lantern, became friends and started dating soon. The rest is a string of adorable tweets and Instagram posts, all available online. They are known for their quick wit and sense of humour, and have proven that their age gap definitely doesn't affect that. 
The recent news of '90s heartthrob Milind Soman getting hitched broke a lot of hearts in the country. But all was forgiven when fans had a glimpse at his relationship with his now wife, Ankita Konwar. The couple is 25 years apart—Konwar is 27, and Soman is 52—but it seems like they have too much in common to have given their age difference any thought. They're both health fanatics, obvious through their fitness posts on social media.

Find out what all the celebrities have been up to in the city 
Warm baths are a great way to cool off after a long day. A day out with friends helps you destress and get your mind off work. You know what's better? Doing it all in London. Part of the Veere Di Wedding crew, including Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja and Rhea Kapoor, is unwinding London-style after a hectic May filled with promotional events and interviews. Add to that Sonam Kapoor's wedding, and this holiday seems like it was a much-needed break from their packed schedules. 
But the Veeres are not alone. The squad's Instagram accounts have constantly featured fellow actors for the past week. Kareena Kapoor Khan was accompanied by her husband, Saif Ali Khan and son, Taimur Ali Khan. They were seen eating lunch together and taking out baby Taimur for a stroll on the streets. Kapoor Khan was also joined by her sister, Karisma Kapoor, who just posted an Instagram picture of the group with the caption “With these lovelies ❤ #londondiaries🇬🇧 #summertime” 
While Kapoor Khan cherished family time, Sonam Kapoor was visited by her cousin as well. Arjun Kapoor—there to shoot his upcoming feature Namastey England with Parineeti Chopra—joined Kareena, Sonam, Rhea and Samyukta Nair on a lunch date last week, and posted a cute groupfie of the gang with the caption “In great company !!! #londonsummer with the Veere's & @SamyuktaNair of course... #bebokillingit and the #kapoorsisters killing it...” Anand Ahuja was also spotted with the crew; the 35-year-old businessman joined Sonam in London and has been updating his Instagram profile with adorable couple pictures since. 
While Rhea Kapoor's Instagram stories are keeping us informed of the girl squad's day, Arjun Kapoor is letting us in on sneak peeks of his film, with videos of Parineeti Chopra that'll make you chuckle.

A quick Instagram recap of the week that just went by 
Last week was quite an eventful one for the Bollywood celebrities, whether they were grabbing lunch with their friends or promoting their upcoming projects. It was a special week for our cover girl, Janhvi Kapoor too, with the release of the trailer of her debut film Dhadak. While Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja celebrated her birthday in London, Alia Bhatt enjoyed a lunch date with her best friend Akanksha Rajan, and Amrita Arora Ladakh shared a party picture with her girl gang. Scroll on to find out everything that happened last week. 
Shah Rukh Khan posted a candid picture of his wife Gauri Khan with daughter Suhana Khan, captioned: “Was reading and came across this line....' Life doesn't come with a manual, it comes with a mother ‘ and then this picture of the ladies...sach hi hai!! (sic)” 
Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja, who was already in London, brought in her 32nd birthday with husband Anand Ahuja and the rest of her crew, including sister Rhea Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Arjun Kapoor and Samyukta Nair. While Rhea Kapoor wished her with multiple Insta posts, Anand Ahuja shared an old picture of the actor and Anil Kapoor expressed his love for his daughter with a throwback post of Kapoor-Ahuja from Maheep and Sanjay Kapoor's wedding. 
Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter attended the trailer launch of their much-awaited film Dhadak with Karan Johar, Shashank Khaitan and the entire Kapoor family in attendance.

The stars have aligned 
She's a global star, an UNICEF global ambassador and a close friend to the Meghan Markle, now Duchess of Sussex. He is a child prodigy with Billboard hits to his name. Though they have an age difference of a decade between them, all speculations surrounding their newly developed intimacy are leading to the probability that Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are, in fact, an item. 
Chopra and Jonas were first seen together in public on the occasion of the Met Gala in 2017. The Quantico star arrived in a jaw-dropping trench dress with Jonas by her side, both dressed by Ralph Lauren and seated on the same table. Back then, no one saw this coming. Chopra herself denied any rumours about the two being together. When talk show host Jimmy Kimmel tried to probe the subject, she replied saying, “Yeah, we were on the same table and we already know each other. So he was like ‘Hey, you wanna go together? And I was like, ‘Yeah, OK, let's go together.' It ended up working out.” However, the two obviously hit it off since, and the rest is for us decode. 
Chopra and Jonas tried to keep things casual in public eye when they attended the Beauty and the Beast live concert together late in May this year. Soon after, the two were spotted at Dodgers game in Los Angeles over the Memorial Day weekend. With little to no PDA to bank upon, fans of both were still unsure about where this was headed. 
Do we stan priyanka chopra and nick jonas being at the same game? We definitely stan. pic.twitter.com/oSLbmt1iKE 
— rinad (@legendpriyanka) May 27, 2018 
Later, the duo was also seen enjoying a quiet dinner dinner at Toca Madera West Hollywood, an upscale Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles earlier this month. 
But in this day and age, it's not true love until it's on social media. Chopra, who loves her In-N-Out burgers, posted a picture enjoying an indulgent meal with her friends, and Jonas was quick to respond with coy “That smile” followed by a heart emoji. Meanwhile, Jonas posted a video of himself with a koala bear from the famous Taronga Zoo in Sydney, and Chopra commented with a “Who is cuter? Lol”. Those shipping the relationship were obviously elated by these exchanges. 
Nothing says ‘we're official' like introducing your girlfriend to your family at a wedding. And last weekend, it seems like Priyanka Chopra went as Nick Jonas' date to his cousin's wedding in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The couple was also spotted at JFK airport the previous day. Basis Jonas' Instagram post with his family, Chopra might also have been introduced to his brothers Kevin and Frankie Jonas, and his parents Denise-Miller Jonas and Paul Kevin Jonas Sr at the ceremony. 
Go through our slideshow for a quick recap of their best moments together till date, and make your own analysis of the situation.

Eid al-Fitr, the day that marks the end of the holy month of Ramzan, falls on June 15 this year. And as we come closer to the big day, Bollywood celebrated festival season with an unmissable Iftaar party in Mumbai this weekend. 
Each year, Baba Siddique hosts a special Iftaar get-together for his family and friends, and this year's celebration was just as grand as the ones before. The day's fast was broken with an evening feast that saw several Bollywood celebrities in attendance. There to celebrate with Baba Siddique and son Zeeshan Siddique were Katrina Kaif, Salman Khan, Shilpa Shetty Kundra, Jacqueline Fernandez, Anil Kapoor, Manish Malhotra, Pooja Hegde, Arbaaz Khan, Suniel Shetty, Huma Qureshi, Bobby Deol, Saqib Salim, Riteish Deshmukh, Richa Chadha, Patralekha, Zayed Khan, Kabir Khan and Mini Mathur. 
For most of the Siddique's celebrity guests, shararas were the pick of the day. While Shetty Kundra chose a black Simar Dugal kurta with gold-detailed sharara pants, Huma Qureshi went with a soothing blue sharara set and Patralekha wore a similar ensemble in bold mango yellow. Giving flared trousers a break, Katrina Kaif and Pooja Hegde wore their kurtas with lehenga skirts (the former in a grey Anjul Bhandari ensemble, and the latter in a bright red Astha Narang look), and Jacqueline Fernandez gave Indian ethnic dressing a modern spin in her anarkali-style Mahima Mahajan gown. 
Before you head for an Iftaar celebration of your own, take notes from Kaif, Shetty Kundra and Fernandez's latest looks. Can't wait to start shopping? Here are Vogue India's favourite Iftaar picks.

It’s finally out! 
It was back in November 2017 that Bollywood fans got a first glimpse at Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter's upcoming film, Dhadak, with a dramatic poster that got everyone talking. Since then, Dharma Productions has released a handful of sneak peeks from the movie over the past few months, and if you've enjoyed checking out Kapoor and Khatter's on-screen avatars, you can't miss the latest update on the film. 
Today marks the release of Dhadak's very first trailer, and for movie buffs, its just the thing your dull Monday needs. Within just an hour of hitting YouTube, the trailer has earned more than 1,60,000 views. Haven't watched it yet? Here's everything you need to know about it. 
Set primarily against regal palaces in Rajasthan, Dhadak's trailer kicks off on a romantic note with Ishaan Khatter promising a mansion to his beau, Janhvi Kapoor. With a mix of endearing moments from the star-crossed lovers' relationship (you won't stop smiling when you hear Khatter belt out the English version of Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani's "Tu Jaane Na" for Kapoor), and intense action scenes that hint at a more dramatic storyline than you first predicted, Dhadak packs a punch with its first look. 
It's safe to say that this June is a special one for Janhvi Kapoor. The Bollywood debutante, who also happens to be Vogue India's cover star this month, took to her Instagram page today to remind her followers to keep an eye out for the trailer, and even celebrated the big moment by putting together a hilarious Dhadak poster of her own on her Insta Stories. On the other hand, Khatter took to the social media platform to share an unseen behind-the-scenes shot with the fans. Scroll through the slideshow below to have a look at their recent posts, along with stills from the trailer.

Vogue India's Bandana Tewari pens a heartbroken goodbye to her hero 
He was a Jersey boy, before he dug his heels into the sinewy back alleys of New York's ‘culinary underbelly'. What this means is, like a true Jersey boy, he swore a lot and his boozy nights always ended in diners, full of raucous indiscipline and existential angst displayed deliciously amongst strangers. At least that's what was imprinted in my post-teen, high testosterone subconscious, every time I watched him on TV, as he drifted languorously from overfed foodies to homeless creatures of the night, prowling the street and music cultures of the world with shamanistic air. He was an old, old soul. With swag. 
In all honesty, I don't remember what he cooked or what his signature dish was. I do remember how he wolfed down a juicy burger, a cheesy taco (from dimly lit street stalls at 2am in the morning in exotic places like Taipei and Beirut), sauce dribbling down a mouth that spoke wisdom and profanity in equal measure. “If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. Walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food. It's a plus for everybody,” he said. He also didn't hesitate to draw jaw-dropping boundaries—“Don't touch my dick, don't touch my knife”. 
So, whilst he may not have fed me a meal through the TV screen; he did do this— he fed me my first glimpse of being an adventuress. Growing up in a family of four girls, I thought if I were ever to be a man I wanted to be this guy. So I emulated him—his disarming charm, his nonchalant way of flirting, and his penchant for delighting in every shade of naughty—the good, the bad and the ugly. My fierce love for street life comes from watching him navigate (and embrace) the arterial innards of cities with their deep, dark secrets. Later in my life, whether it was Rio di Jenerio, Buenos Aires or Goa, I carried the ‘Bourdain Spirit' with me and met with crazy adventures that unravelled my life, my perceptions and my ignorance. I also ate weird food in his memory. 
Bourdain was a raconteur with street cred—the Jay-Z of the travel-chef world. He always competed for the top slot in my (imaginary) dinner list with astrophysicist Neil de Grasse Tyson, both unparalleled and enthralling storytellers. If you don't believe me, Google the chat between these two behemoth brains. Little did I know, my fascination for both became the benchmark for future amours. If men weren't witty, kind and irreverent, like my homies, they would be led to the curb. 
But the man who coined the term ‘Culinary Underbelly' also had a challenging side. Bourdain grew up in the Mad Men time—a tumble-and-dry era of social mores, where old rules broke as easily as new ones emerged. I was heartbroken when I read a piece in The Guardian in 2013 where Bourdain said: “I was rebellious and bitter that I wasn't old enough to be in San Francisco, dropping acid and having sex with hippie chicks. I had impeccable taste in rock 'n' roll for a 10-year-old, yet was too young to live that life. It made me angry. Most of my friends had rich absentee parents or came from broken homes, so they were free to do whatever they wanted. I deeply resented the relative stability at my house. I started taking drugs as soon as I encountered them. I wanted to be an underground cartoonist like Robert Crumb, but I was too lazy, undisciplined and stoned to apply myself to anything in particular. Back then I was a miserable, self-destructive lout.” 
At that time, mired in my own existential angst, I found Bourdain's self-deprecatory humour to be the most endearing part of his oeuvre, often quoting Nietzsche to validate his inner dystopia: “One must have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.” I was a sucker for this shit and found it excitingly destructive-regenerative—a perfect formula for my life. But I was wrong. Pain, which is that deep-seated, is not life-affirming. It is, more often than not, life-depleting. Today, Bourdain's death reminds me that self-loathing, peppered with ideals of nor-conformity, can come with a price. And he paid it. 
And yet, as our world bemoans the death of this stellar man with obvious questions of whys and hows—I have a question. In a world where missiles are killing little innocent children, and plastic waste is choking our whales, how do we define death? More importantly, how do we define an honourable death? 
To Antony Bourdain, my spirit doppelganger, I wish you many lifetimes-to-come of revelry on this earth. I wish you a deep, honourable sleep. See you on the other side.

What's your favourite actor's second shift? 
Many would have found a hectic roster of acting commitments to be a full-time job, but the multi-hyphenate women ruling the industry today are nothing if not tenacious. Have successfully managed to stretch the 24 hours allotted to us, mere mortals, these women are storming the frontier of pretty much everything—from turning investor in up-and-coming startups to using their clout to shed light on essential causes. From Priyanka Chopra to Deepika Padukone, here's what you'll find your favourite names doing when they aren't reporting for duty. 
[#image: /photos/5ce4324ab803119dcb8f76a9]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/AnushkaSharma 
Back in 2014, Sharma was reported to have taken on a Master of Economics degree through correspondence, and she has clearly putting it to good use at Clean Slate Films, the production house that she runs with her brother. Eschewing the mainstream choices, the trailblazer has earned a name for herself behind the camera as well by picking up unconventional scripts, starting out with the critically acclaimed NH10 (2015). Her production debut was followed up with Phillauri (2016) and Pari (2017), both of which reinforced her commitment to back smaller, niche talent. 
  
[#image: /photos/5ce4324989be364edd7d0870]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/PriyankaChopra 
Jetsetter extraordinaire, Chopra is used to wearing many hats—preferably, from Philip Treacy—and has perfected the balancing act between her global career commitments and her role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights. Though she is currently in the news for having returned from Rohingya last week where she met with children from one of the world's largest refugee camps, the actor has been working as a child rights activist for the past decade and donates ten percent of her earnings to fund the expenses of 70 unprivileged children in India. 
  
[#image: /photos/5ce43249f55c27b66ba27fe5]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/SonamKapoor 
It was always only a matter of time before fashion's favourite darling launched her own label, and Rheson was launched in 2017 amidst much fanfare. The high street offering's moniker serves up an amalgamation of the sister duo running the show and together, they use their sartorial acumen to design retro-inspired collections at price points that remain accessible for a wide spectrum of fashion lovers. 
  
[#image: /photos/5ce43249cc50be767f13fdb9]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/tlllfoundation 
It was her own battle with depression at the peak of her career in 2014 that informed Padukone's decision to become a vocal ambassador for mental health awareness in the country. The Padmaavat star founded The Live Love Laugh Foundation the next year, and has since been using her position of influence to reduce the stigma around mental health issues. 
  
[#image: /photos/5ce4324a4a30b3818012dc16]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/kaemasutra 
When she isn't racking up the commercial chartbusters at the box office, Fernandez can be found indulging her love for food by turning restauranteur herself—Kaema Sutra in Colombo, Sri Lanka and Pali Thai, Mumbai have both been founded by the Judwaa 2 actor. Last year, she also invested 3.5 crores in Raw Pressery, a cold-pressed juice label that mirrors her commitment to clean eating. 
  
[#image: /photos/5ce4324ac33f5c43538f1db0]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/TwinkleRKhanna 
In a serendipitous move worthy of some of the fairytale movies that she's starred in, Khanna found her true calling after leaving the movies. The fabulous mother of two authored Mrs Funnybones in 2015 that went on to sell over one thousand copies and earned her the title of India's highest-selling female author for the year. She doubled down on the success of her debut with her sophomore outing, The Legend of Laxmi Prasad, that also went on to sell over one hundred thousand copies. One of the short stories from the book inspired Pad Man (2018), and Khanna personally served as a co-producer on the biographical comedy that aimed to spread awareness about menstrual hygiene.

You'd be lying if you told us that you hadn't at least once wanted to peek into Arora Khan's wardrobe. It is just as well that the street style queen decided to team up with Bipasha Basu and Sussanne Khan to launch The Label Life, a homegrown label that serves am to pm essentials, from crisp white shirts to statement tableware. 
  
[#image: /photos/5ce4324a1dc267cc54c792a3]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com/AliaaBhatt 
If her track record at the box office hadn't tipped you off already, Bhatt has been using her overachiever personality to stay ahead of the pack, and recently invested in a small minority stake in fashion-tech startup, StyleCracker. A passionate animal rights activist at heart, she also launched CoExist last year as an ecological initiative to reduce the conflict between humans and animals and promote sustainability for both.

Another Bollywood-studded night 
May 2018 was an unforgettable month for Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja. After months of dating entrepreneur Anand Ahuja, the actor finally tied the knot in a grand, three-day celebration in Mumbai. #SonamKiShaadi, which can easily be considered one of this year's most-talked about celebrity weddings, kicked off with an intimate mehandi ceremony at home on May 6. Following that, the celebrations continued to include a larger mehandi for the couple's extended circle of friends, a picture-perfect Anand Karaj ceremony, and then the star-studded wedding reception. Over the course of the wedding, Bollywood fans saw everyone from the Bachchans and Shah Rukh Khan to Kareena Kapoor Khan, Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan in attendance. 
But if you thought Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja and Anand Ahuja's wedding celebrations were over and done with, you're in for a surprise. This weekend, Natasha Poonawalla hosted a party for the new couple, and the pictures have already got #EverydayPhenomenal fans talking. 
Held at the Poonawalla's residence, the latest celebration was attended by Anil Kapoor, Rhea Kapoor, Karan Johar, Shikha Talsania, Karisma Kapoor, Amrita Arora Ladak, Shakeel Ladak, Malaika Arora and Arpita Mehta, among others. While Sonam attended in a deep blue shimmer-detailed gown (don't miss those princess-y sleeves), Anand looked dapper in a pinstriped suit. Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja wore her dress with a sparkling choker, red lips and a slicked back bun. Did you miss the picture-perfect tiered gold cake Sonam and Anand cut into as part of the celebrations?

Guest starring: Khushi Kapoor 
Janhvi Kapoor is one of the buzziest names in Bollywood right now. Daughter of the late icon Sridevi, Kapoor is being launched under Karan Johar's tutelage with Dhadak, and has her debut movie's release slotted just a few short weeks. But before her big screen premiere, the rising star added another milestone to her journey with her first ever magazine cover shoot and interview, for Vogue India's June 2018 issue. 
Prep for her debut cover shoot began the night before, as Janhvi Kapoor was brought to the hotel where the shoot took place ahead of time to keep the occasion under wraps against the prying paparazzi that now follows her every move. The day had an early start for Kapoor, who was up at 4am and started her hair and makeup at 6, and still managed to breeze through the day like a professional years into her career. Kapoor was visibly enthusiastic about her debut, and enjoyed her time trying on different looks (including the cover ensemble, which she said was her favourite look) and posing for the lens. 
Like a true mentor and friend, Karan Johar dropped by at the location and kept her company for a good part of the day, keeping her spirits up. And Johar wasn't the only one who made an appearance on Janhvi's big day; sister Khushi Kapoor was there too for a few quick laughs and a selfie break.

Weekly Instagram recap: Alia Bhatt preps up for Brahmastra with Ranbir Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan

News 
Here's how Kapoor confirmed the speculations in a recent interview 
Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor are the newest (official) couple in Bollywood, and we have to say, we called it. The confirmation came through an interview with Ranbir Kapoor in GQ India's June issue, where the actor went on record and finally admitted to dating Alia Bhatt. “It's really new right now, and I don't want to over speak. It needs time to breathe and it needs space,” the 35-year-old actor revealed. “As an actor, as a person, Alia is – what's the right word? – flowing right now. When I see her work, when I see her act, even in life, what she gives is something that I'm aspiring to for myself. It's new for us, so let it cook a bit.” 
Rumours of their relationship have been doing the rounds for a while now. Since the filming of their movie, Brahmastra, began, Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor have been spotted in public on multiple occasions, and not just during their offshore shooting schedules. Their entrance together at Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja's reception and Bhatt's Instagram posts the day after only fuelled the gossip mills, but both the actors kept mum about their relationship, until now. 
In this latest interview, the Saawariya actor had nothing but affectionate words for Bhatt. On being asked what he thinks is the best thing about being in love, he said, “It always comes with a lot of excitement. It's a new person, it comes with new beats. Old tricks become new tricks again – you know, being charming and romantic, all of that. I think I'm more balanced today. I value relationships more. I can appreciate hurt and what it does to a person much more than I could a couple years back.” 
While the news may be have expected, if not awaited, Kapoor's fond words have definitely left fans gushing about the couple. And with Bhatt's love for sharing her life through Instagram pictures, we can hope to see more from them soon.

We did some snooping around 
Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor are currently shooting for Brahmastra, a superhero fantasy film directed by Ayan Mukerji and produced by Karan Johar. Over the last few months, the duo has travelled to Israel and Bulgaria quite a few times in preparation for the upcoming feature and sure enough, have been spotted spending time together. It started with the co-stars posing against scenic landscapes with others in the frame in a few pictures she shared on Instagram. Then, Neetu Kapoor, Ranbir's mother, happened to be in Bulgaria in March to bring Alia's birthday in. And last evening, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt arrived together at Sonam Kapoor-Ahuja and Anand Ahuja's reception party, looking like, well, a couple. 
Rewind all the way back to 2014 when Bhatt starred in Imtiaz Ali's Highway, Bhatt and Kapoor were seen in conversation about their careers shaping up. While both stars were (allegedly) seeing other people around the time, they spoke about each other's talent with immense respect. However, over time, the two seem to have grown closer together. And while it's possible that the romance is all conjecture, Bollywood insiders have been speculating the two getting together for a while now. 
The age difference between the stars is apparent—Bhatt is 25 while Kapoor is 10 years her senior. Alia Bhatt has exhibited maturity well beyond her years since her debut in Bollywood, and it is evident in the nature of the roles she has taken up. Some would argue that her otherwise bubbly sense of style has evolved into a more sophisticated one, and a serious development in her personal (specifically, romantic) life was responsible in the change. 
As a rule, Bollywood celebrities refrain from making their private lives public, but the two posing for the cameras together at Sonam Kapoor's wedding only suggests that they are opening up to the idea of making their relationship public. And that's not all. Alia Bhatt posted a picture of them together from the night on her Instagram stories and on her feed, both cryptically captioned, but in a positive light.

From the proposal to their wedding plans 
2018 is going to see not just one, but two Ambanis tying the knot. Just a little over a month after Akash Ambani proposed to girlfriend Shloka Mehta in a private ceremony in Goa, Nita and Mukesh Ambani's daughter Isha Ambani made things official with her fiancé, businessman Anand Piramal too. Twin sister to Akash, Isha was proposed to at a temple in Mahabaleshwar over the weekend. After saying yes to her beau, the couple celebrated their big moment with their parents and family members. Before the country gears up for both the Ambani kids' big days, here's a quick look at everything you need to know about Anand Piramal. 
Son of Swati Piramal and businessman Ajay Piramal, 33-year-old Anand Piramal is a Harvard Business School graduate and has also studied economics at the University of Pennsylvania. He is currently the executive director of Piramal Enterprises, which is said to be valued at $4 billion. Isha Ambani's future husband has already founded two startup companies since leaving business school: a real estate startup called Piramal Realty, and Piramal eSwasthya, a rural healthcare startup that treats close to 40,000 patients on a daily basis. He also holds the title of the youngest president of the Indian Merchant Chamber, Youth Wing. 
While Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta celebrated their engagement with a sundown party in Goa, Anand Piramal and Isha Ambani did things a little differently. The 33-year-old entrepreneur popped the question during a visit to a temple in Mahabaleshwar this weekend. Post the proposal, the couple celebrated with an intimate lunch with Nita and Mukesh Ambani, Swati and Ajay Piramal, grandparents Kokilaben Ambani and Purnimaben Dalal, Akash Ambani, Anant Ambani, and Anand Piramal's sister Nandini Piramal, among other close family members. Isha kept her look for the occasion simple with an oversized white tee and grey leggings. 
No stranger to the Ambani family, Anand Piramal recently spoke out about Mukesh Ambani's influence on his career choices, and thanked him for his guidance. “I asked him whether I should get into consulting or banking,” Piramal revealed. “He told me, ‘Bring a consultant is like watching cricket or commentating about cricket, while being an entrepreneur is like playing cricket. You can't learn how to play cricket by commentating. If you want to do something, be an entrepreneur in the long term, and start now.'” 
Just like Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta, Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal will be tying the knot this December, most likely in India itself. The couple have been friends for a long time and their families share a four decade-long friendship. Scroll through our gallery below for a look at the newly betrothed couple.

A new Prince of Cambridge has been born, Kensington Palace has confirmed 
Kensington Palace has announced that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have welcomed her third child, a baby boy. The news was confirmed on Twitter this evening. 
“Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a son,” read the statement, “Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well.” The baby was delivered at 11.01am, weighing 8 pounds and 7 ounces. 
Like his siblings, the new royal arrival was born at The Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London. Keeping with tradition, the prince's birth was announced on an easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace as well. 
As with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, it is expected that the Duke and Duchess will be spotted outside the Lindo Wing with their latest addition before long. Prince George, who took more than 10 hours to be delivered, and Princess Charlotte, who was born less than three hours after being admitted to hospital, were both introduced to the world on the steps of the same London hospital. 
The royal couple first announced that they were expecting their third child last September, a week after visiting the Princess Diana memorial garden at Kensington Palace to mark the 20th anniversary of her death and not long after their first family tour to Poland and Germany. As with her previous two pregnancies, the Duchess suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, suspending her royal duties briefly before returning to them in January this year. 
The yet to be named prince is the Queens sixth great-grandchild, and fifth in line to the throne, behind his grandfather Prince Charles, his father Prince William and his siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte. A shakeup of the rules before Princess Charlotte was born removed the male bias before, meaning she would not be leapfrogged in the line of succession. The latest royal baby's arrival makes Prince Harry sixth in line to the throne. The new Prince of Cambridge is also great-great-great-great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria. 
Although it was never confirmed, it was widely speculated that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding was planned with the Duchess's due date in mind. She is expected to attend the royal wedding in Windsor on May 19, though it is not known whether the latest member of the royal family will be in attendance too.

From Alia Bhatt's multiple promotional rounds to announcements of upcoming projects and Beyoncé's Coachella performance that took over the internet, this week was definitely an exciting one for the world's favourite celebrities. Let's take a look back at the week that was. 
It was celebration time for Deepika Padukone, Karan Johar and Janhvi Kapoor. While the Padmaavat actor made it to TIME's 100 Most Influential People list, Karan Johar shared the news of becoming the first Indian filmmaker to get a wax statue at the Madame Tussauds with his fans. Wrapping up her upcoming feature Dhadak, Janhvi Kapoor shared an adorable picture with co-star Ishaan Khattar and director Shashank Khaitan captioned, “Home”. 
  
While everyone else was busy working and celebrating, Priyanka Chopra and Shahid Kapoor were spending quality time with their respective families. The Quantico actor, who is always busy travelling for her projects, took some time off and struck a pose with her mother at an Irish cafe. Back home, Shahid Kapoor spent some quality time playing with little Misha, and Disha Patani posted a picture with her dog. But nothing could beat Neetu and Rishi Kapoor's sweet post-vacation selfie. 
This week also saw Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone playing showstoppers for designer Manish Malhotra's Mijwan showcase, while Aditya Roy Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha started shooting for their upcoming film Kalank.

Here are all the details 
Today, Time released its annual Most Influential People list, a roundup of 100 leaders, tastemakers, and trendsetters who are changing the world as we know it. One of those distinguished? Soon-to-be royal Meghan Markle. 
Priyanka Chopra, a dear friend of Markle's, wrote an essay for the occasion, giving a glimpse not only into their friendship, but Markle's persona behind closed doors. “Somewhere among biryani, poutine, and endless conversations, I realized just how deeply Meghan Markle cares for the world. With her, what you see is real, and what you get is a relatable young woman with her heart and mind in the right place,” Chopra writes. 
She also stressed that Markle would be much more than just a prince's plus-one—“Meghan is an important influencer in a world that needs strong public figures to respect and look up to,” Chopra says. “Meghan, standing shoulder to shoulder with Harry, will be a princess for the people.” 
Even before Markle was engaged to Prince Harry, Chopra has called attention to her friend's powerful persona and success. During an appearance on The Wendy Williams Show, after the host referred to Markle as “Prince Harry's girlfriend,” she responded: “Also, Meghan Markle, actress, Suits, her achievements.” 
Markle has certainly proved she's no royal wallflower, starting what she has described as her “new chapter” out swinging. Just this week, she started her work with the Commonwealth Youth Forum, and recently spoke out about the #MeToo movement. 
And that's all before she comes a full-fledged member of the Windsor Family. For Markle, it seems, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a life dedicated to activism anew.

A family affair 
It is no secret that the Kapoor clan is one of the most closely-knit families in Bollywood. From Randhir Kapoor's birthday bash to the Christmas soirée last year, they're often spotted celebrating milestones together. This time around, the clan gathered to celebrate Babita Kapoor's 70th birthday. Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan were spotted arriving for the party, although Taimur seemed to be missing from the celebrations. Others at the party were sister Karisma Kapoor with her children Samaira and Kiaan Raj, Randhir Kapoor, and cousins Armaan and Aadar Jain, along with their mother Reema Jain. 
While Kapoor Khan chose an interesting asymmetrical dress paired with statement earrings for the occasion, sister Karisma went for a patterned black and white number with matching shoes. Saif Ali Khan, usually spotted in his jeans and T-shirt uniform, went the ethnic route with a simple maroon kurta and white pyjamas. 
Randhir and Babita Kapoor both chose all-black outfits. While he picked a striped silk scarf to accessorise, Babita accented her outfit with a statement pearl necklace and berry lips. The veteran actor posed with her grandkids, Samaira and Kiaan Raj, who wore a dark floral dress and a blue shirt respectively for the party. 
Check out all the pictures from the celebrations below.

Here's the adorable way they made the announcement 
Just a few weeks back, we reported on rumours that Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor may be expecting their second child. The couple has just announced that they are indeed adding another to their young family of three, and it was with the most adorable Instagram post. 
Shahid and Mira both released the same picture—little Misha laughing next to a chalk drawing of balloons, with the words "Big Sister" on top—a message that, while subtle, puts to rest all the speculation going on since the past few weeks. 
The couple has publicly expressed their desire for another kid a few times since Misha was born. When asked about career plans in an interview, Rajput Kapoor had responded saying, "I am going to have another baby, and then decide." 
Last year, Shahid too had elaborated on the subject. “Mira, who is just 22, would prefer to have a second kid soon as well,” Kapoor revealed to GQ India last February. “She wants to flip the norm, get the kids to a certain age and then be free to do what she likes. It wasn't planned actually, but I think we were ready for it. I was impatient to get married and have a family. My job is a lonely one. I was lonely for three or four years.” 
Shahid, 37, and Mira, 23, tied the knot in 2015 in a private ceremony in Delhi, followed by a grand reception at Mumbai's St Regis hotel. Their first, Misha, was born in August 2016 and will turn two this year, ready to take on the responsibility of being the "big sister" of the Kapoor family's youngest member. 
We wish the family all the very best!

Couple goals 
There's little doubt that Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan are high on Bollywood's power couple list. Whether they're stepping out for dinner or taking baby Taimur on a play date, the two make sure they spend quality family time together, despite their hectic individual schedules. Yesterday, Kareena Kapoor Khan was spotted attending her mother Babita Kapoor's birthday dinner in Mumbai with husband Saif Ali Khan. The duo was joined by the entire Kapoor family, including Karisma Kapoor, Randhir Kapoor, Aadar Jain and Armaan Jain.

For the occasion, Kapoor Khan left her go-to bodycon dresses at home for a black and blue Balenciaga number. While the relaxed fit of her sleeveless dress made it perfect for a dinner date on a hot summer night, it was the blue asymmetrical panel on the hem that made it a statement. Saif Ali Khan complemented her in a maroon kurta paired with white pyjamas and brown shoes. Playing strong in the accessory department, the actor elevated her dinner look with a pair of oversized statement earrings to give her otherwise basic look a glamorous appeal. A pair of classic black pump heels, a shimmery clutch bag and a watch finished her look. She kept the attention on her outfit by opting for soft tousled waves and glossy lips for her beauty look. 
If you're looking to stock up your summer wardrobe with stylish dresses too, take cues from Kapoor Khan's latest appearance and invest in black numbers with a pop of colour, instead of going back to your run-of-the-mill LBDs. The trick to acing Kapoor Khan's latest look is to use one element to elevate your outfit—be it a statement bag or oversized earrings. 
Take a closer peek at Kareena Kapoor Khan's look from Babita Kapoor's birthday dinner, and choose from our edit to shop.

Padukone is only Bollywood actor to make it to their list this year, which also includes Indian cricketer Virat Kohli 
She may have entered the industry as “Prakash Padukone's daughter”, but in no time, Deepika Padukone has made her own mark in the Indian film industry. The 32-year-old Padmaavat star is the only Bollywood actor to be featured in the TIME magazine's coveted 100 Most Influential People list this year. Apart from Padukone, the line-up includes Indian cricketer Virat Kohli, apart from other personalities like Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot. 
Padukone's xXx: Return of Xander Cage co-star Vin Diesel celebrates her success through a piece for the magazine, which quotes him saying: “Deepika is the best Earth has to offer. She's not just here to represent India; she's here to represent the world.” 
Diesel recollects his first meeting with Padukone in the piece, "When Deepika Padukone came in to read for one of the Fast and the Furious films, I knew instantly I was in the presence of someone very special. As soon as she entered the room, there was a synchronicity, a synergy, a chemistry—it promised great things to come. Her schedule didn't work for that movie, but I never gave up. She was the first role we cast in xXx: Return of Xander Cage." 
Although Padukone started off with a focus on badminton as a child, given that her father was a star player for the country, she changed her career to enter the competitive world of modelling and soon turned to Bollywood, taking her first steps into the international film industry last year. But even after years on the silver screen, the actor is no stranger to the runway. Case in point: Just yesterday, she walked the ramp with Ranbir Kapoor for Manish Malhotra's Mijwan show. 
TIME claims that the 2018 list has a record of 45 people under the age of 40, including Netflix show Stranger Things actor, Millie Bobby Brown.

A timeline of one of Bollywood’s favourite couples 
It's been close to three decades since Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan tied the knot. And yet, after all these years, the couple continues to be one of India's most discussed and admired Bollywood couples. Whether the Khans are spotted flying out of the country with their three kids, celebrating with their close-knit group of friends, or supporting each other's projects—they never fail to receive lots of love from their millions of fans on social media. And despite their popularity, Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan have always managed to keep relationship private. Here's a look back at some of their biggest milestones together. 
  
Few know it, but Shah Rukh first fell for Gauri when he was 18 years old. The Delhi teen bumped into Gauri at a party when she was just 14. Rumour has it that the couple's first date was at Delhi's Panchshila Club. Anupama Chopra's book King of Bollywood: Shah Rukh Khan and the Seductive World of Indian Cinema also reveals that the young couple spent their first meeting (which barely lasted five minutes) sitting by the pool, ‘nervously sipping colas'. Once Shah Rukh got Gauri's number, he'd call her at home pretending to be a friend named Shaheen.

Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan's road to settling down together wasn't the easiest. During their courtship years, the couple are said to have faced several hurdles. One fight between the two led Gauri to leave Delhi for Mumbai without letting Shah Rukh know. With just Rs 10,000 in his pocket, Shah Rukh followed Gauri to the city that would eventually become his home, and made up with her at Mumbai's Gorai beach. The couple finally got married on October 25, 1991. Turns out, Shah Rukh Khan had to borrow a suit from the costume department of his movie Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman for the occasion.

Having worked in several TV series, Shah Rukh took the decision to move to Mumbai reportedly as a way to escape the feeling of loss left behind after his mother's death. But believe it or not, Gauri wasn't always on board with her husband's career plans. “She prayed for Shah Rukh's film to fail so that they could move back to Delhi,” director and close friend Karan Johar once told Vogue. “I had no patience for films,” Gauri agrees. “It was only after I met Shah Rukh that I learnt to enjoy his passion for cinema.” Over the years, Gauri hasn't just stood by her husband's projects; she's endorsed them too. Gauri has played producer for many of Shah Rukh's films including Main Hoon Na (2004), Om Shanti Om (2007) and Dear Zindagi (2016). Which of his roles is her favourite? “I loved him in Chak De! India (2007). I thought he looked and performed his best.”

Six years after their wedding, the Khans welcomed their first son, Aryan, on November 13. Since then, the celebrity duo's family has grown by two more. Shah Rukh and Gauri's only daughter, Suhana, was born on May 22, 2000, while their youngest, AbRam Khan came via surrogacy on May 27, 2013. While Shah Rukh Khan has always been in the spotlight, his family is seldom seen at public outings. “My life is with Shah Rukh and the kids,” Gauri Khan once revealed to Vogue. “He is the best husband and father I could ever ask for. I always say that I am so fortunate to be with Shah Rukh Khan, the man. I don't come from a space where I gush and praise—the world is doing enough of that. I like to keep my love for him private and inside the doors of Mannat.” In Shah Rukh's words, “We give marriage too much importance; we're trying too hard. Things that are done with ease, acceptance and love will always be successful. The best thing we do is wake up in the morning and have a cup of tea and family time. I can't understand the importance given to Gauri and my marriage—if you can keep a marriage ordinary, that's what makes it special.”

These days, Gauri Khan is busy with interior designing projects and her new store, Gauri Khan Designs. When Shah Rukh isn't celebrating his wife's milestone moments (remember when the couple came together at the opening party of Arth?), you can expect to see him bringing his birthday in with her at their Alibaug home, or attending award shows by her side. After all, there's no forgetting how perfect the two looked at Vogue's Women of the Year Awards. Take a walk through Shah Rukh and Gauri's relationship timeline below.

Here's how you can get her look 
Sonam Kapoor's Instagram feed is currently flooding with posts of her travels in Dubai—the star is in the Emirate for the IWC Schaffhausen gala. The actor has made her love for dressing up clear on many occasions. After choosing a white pantsuit by Delpozo earlier in the trip, Kapoor went with a pop pink look yesterday. Making a statement with monochrome, she paired a ruffled pink crop top with a high waisted skirt and a jacket, all by Rosie Assoulin. 
Of late, Sonam Kapoor has been flaunting her toned abs often (remember her airport look?). Yesterday too, she threw a sporty zipper jacket over her look to balance the bare waistline. The star accessorised her ensemble with a sleek bun, Chopard jewellery and a wristwatch by IWC Schaffhausen. It's hard to categorise Kapoor's outfit under cocktail or athleisure, but as usual, she succeeded in creating a look with recall value. 
Take cues from Kapoor and style a crop top with a long skirt for a relaxed summer soirée or a mehendi event. To add a touch of sportiness, pair it with a bomber jacket thrown across your shoulder, or opt for a ponytail in place of the sleek bun. Choose a monochromatic palette in place of colour blocking to give your ensemble more impact. 
Kapoor was also seen in a black gown by Elie Saab and a green strapless number by Ashi Studio on the same day. Both looks were perfect to be worn to a formal cocktail evening, and are sure to add a touch of glamour to your night out. Here's how you can recreate Sonam Kapoor's look.

Perfect for a private getaway 
In November 2017, another fairytale romance was added to the books as Prince Harry announced his engagement to Meghan Markle. Following the headline-grabbing proposal, Markle, primarily famous for her role as Rachel Zane in the popular sitcom Suits, was pushed further into the spotlight. 
With Kensington palace being tight-lipped, social media scavengers hungry for details scrutinised every public move of the royal couple. From potential wedding gown designers to the guest list, everything is now a hot topic of conversation. The latest piece of information doing the rounds? The couple's honeymoon destination. Following in the footsteps of their predecessors the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the duo have reportedly chosen to head to the sun-dappled African nation of Namibia. As one of the least populated countries, it is an ideal place if you're looking to escape the public eye. Natural Selection's Hoanib Valley Camp, where the newlyweds are rumoured to be staying, is known for its rich wildlife and breathtaking scenery. 
However, the royal honeymoon isn't the couple's first holiday in Southwest Africa. Markle has previously joined Prince Harry at Botswana for a romantic week of camping under the stars in the early days of their fairy tale romance. So, it only seems natural to go back and revisit the experience at the threshold of their new life together.

Check out her matching juttis, too 
Alia Bhatt has been on a sartorial roll ever since she started promoting her upcoming feature Raazi. From stepping out in a blue Anita Dongre kurta to donning a muted Varsha Wadhwa number, the actor has been channeling her on-screen avatar of Sehmat from Raazi with her recent outfit choices. Continuing her streak, the actor was spotted attending yet another promotional event in the city yesterday. The Highway star chose a midnight blue kurta and palazzo pants by Kotwara for her latest outing. The breezy kurta featured a strappy neckline instead of sleeves, and served as a refreshing change to the basic ones she's been spotted in often nowadays. 
The floral patchwork on Alia Bhatt's kurta and dupatta added interesting visual details to her otherwise simple look. The sleeveless number is primed to beat the Mumbai heat, and is perfect for the next mehandi event on your summer wedding calendar. The actor rounded off her beauty look with dewy makeup, nude lips, sleek eyeliner and soft curls, and accessorised with nothing but a pair of red and blue earrings by Amrapali Jewels. Staying in sync with her ethnic look, Alia Bhatt finished her ensemble with pretty nude juttis by NeedleDust. 
Alia Bhatt's recent outfit demonstrates how the prospect of ethnic wedding wear doesn't have to have you breaking in a sweat (literally and figuratively). A lehenga might be unavoidable for the reception, but for mehandi or an afternoon sangeet, take style cues from Bhatt's recent outfit and choose airy, breathable kurtas, and style them with a pair of classic juttis. Take your look up a notch and style your kurta set with metallic heels. Here's how you can get her look.

And everything else that happened last week 
Ever since the Women's March in the beginning of 2017, the cause of women's empowerment has been steadily gaining steam. Fighting for equal rights, and against gender discrimination, sexual and other forms of assault, have become the order of the day, in a movement that, thanks to social media, now spans countries and continents. 
In our weekly newsletter every Monday, we aim to bring to you the latest updates from the front line—everything, big or small, that will help spark meaningful conversations in the move towards equality. Below, the updates from last week. 
– Thursday, April 12 saw Saudi Arabia host its first Fashion Week, albeit more than fashionably late. The event suffered major delays due to a number of reasons—logistical problems, visa troubles for the foreign attendees, and bad weather. First scheduled to begin on March 25, the event was postponed till Wednesday, April 11. High-profile guest designers like Jean Paul Gaultier and Roberto Cavalli flew in from their part of the world, only to face yet another 24-hour delay because of a sandstorm. European and Arabian designers showcased at the event that was held at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, including the kingdom's own Arwa Al Banawi (who has collaborated with Adidas Originals for a capsule collection), and Mashael Al Rajhi, who owns a eponymous gender-inclusive label. The conservative kingdom did place restrictions on the kind of clothes that would be exhibited—no cleavage, nothing above the knee and nothing too transparent—and allowed an all-female audience. More so, organisers were the only ones allowed to take pictures, and photos had to be cleared government censors before they could be published. What's making news is the fact that this high-profile plan for a first fashion week in Saudi Arabia was unthinkable even two years ago. Organised by the Arab Fashion Council, this fashion week comes at a time of ambitious plans for economic and social reform in the country, which are led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
– The Kathua rape case of eight-year-old Asifa, who was brutally raped and murdered in January this year, has shaken the whole country over the last few days. The case has been taken up by Deepika S Rajawat, an advocate in Jammu and the chairperson and founder of Voice for Rights—an NGO that works among underprivileged women and children. Last week, Rajawat appeared on a television channel alleging that she was being threatened for her life, and said she's going taking the matter to the Supreme Court. “I am not scared, but I am not feeling safe either. Protesters (lawyers) are trying to put pressure on me so that I don't fight for justice. But I will continue to fight Asifa's case. I have full faith in the police investigation,” she told TV channels. 
– After Wonder Woman broke box office records by making more than $600 million worldwide in 2017, and BBC announced a female lead for its cult classic TV series, Doctor Who—Jodie Whittaker will play the first female Doctor in the series' extensive history—the future of media may just be female. Academy Award-winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg recently stated that the fifth film in the Indiana Jones movie franchise will most likely be Harrison Ford's last one. A recent interview with The Sun led to Spielberg telling readers how he thinks it is time the popular character took “a different form.” When questioned if this could mean a female lead, Spielberg said, “We'd have to change the name from Jones to Joan. And there would be nothing wrong with that.”

Take notes 
Sonam Kapoor is every designer's dream come true when it comes to her dedication to fashion experiments. It's not just the form flattering trends she goes after—Kapoor is known to try out-of-the box ensembles that wouldn't necessarily be high on your shopping list, but she build a strong case for. Case in point—Sonam Kapoor's oversized airport look that was well-balanced and surprisingly wearable. 
The Veere Di Wedding star styled a boxy crop top with wide legged trousers in place of the usual athleisure separates commonly spotted at the airport. The crop top accentuated Kapoor's waistline, adding definition to otherwise roomy silhouette of the trousers. Keeping things sharp in the accessories department, the actor chose pointy flats and a leather handbag in neutral blacks. On point with the return of the '90s style Matrix-inspired sunglasses, the sartorial champ went with small round frames. She also added a touch of gold with a minimal wristwatch and small hoops. 
Kapoor's separates make for an interesting choice, whether you're headed to a workplace or to a family lunch. White and blue set the mood for the summer and the combination is definitely worth trying this season. If you're looking to try her airport look but want to further accentuate your frame, you could try adding a broad obi belt that cinches at your waist. If you are petite and find yourself drowning in wide-legged trousers, go for higher heels. Here's how you can recreate Sonam Kapoor's airport look.

Add to your suitcase 
Kangana Ranaut loves her classic saris. From acing Raw Mango's brocade numbers to stepping out in elaborate Sabyasachi drapes, she has done it all. The Queen actor, who has been busy working on her upcoming feature Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, was spotted attending a friend's wedding reception last night. In the spirit of channelling a summery look, Ranaut stepped out in a sheer blue sari from Anita Dongre's latest collection. 
To complement the floral detailing on the sheer sari, she paired the pastel drape with a matching embroidered blouse. Keeping the easy theme going, Ranaut went with shimmery pink eye shadow, muted lips, and tied her hair back in a bun. The summer-perfect blue and the intricate floral thread work on her sari made it perfect for a summer wedding. She kept things simple in the accessory department with a sleek necklace by Anmol Jewellers, and nothing else. A pair of metallic silver peep toe heels completed her Indian ethnic look. 
If you have a summer wedding on the cards too, just take a leaf out of Kangana Ranaut's style book. Pick a sheer sari just like the actor's pastel number, and dress it up with simple accessories and metallic heels. Scroll through our gallery for a closer look at Kangana Ranaut's look.

"The girl who went through mental abuse as a child and teenager and then adult on the streets of Mumbai, continues to face the same, now as a mum, like so many other women (and men) and children in our country" 
Today, I head to Church for my usual 9am Sunday Mass with my 14-year-old son and my mother with black bands around our arms—a symbolic gesture to protest against the rape of the eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir and the 17-year-old young woman in UP. “We should be a nation in mourning,” says the Church in a message to all Christians, and I agree. 
As someone who grew up thinking it was “normal” to be eve-teased on a daily basis from my home to my school bus when I was just 10, then “normal” to be groped while I travelled by train to college and later work, it's still shocking when I read stories of brutal rape of kids (both boys and girls, even though we get to hear more of the latter) and women, even now at 43, with a teen son of my own. Some of these were committed in broad day light with the public pretending it's “normal” to watch and not intervene, cops thinking it's “normal” to shame the victims, politicos and news channels making it their birth right to use the “cases” to debate and deliberate and further their own cause, all the while the victims (if alive) and the families have to suffer in silence, especially if they don't belong to a certain strata of society. 
In the 43 years that I've been alive, I'd have thought we've progressed as a country, not just in business and other such sectors (India is shining, really?) but with our thoughts, beliefs and views as well. Why haven't we learnt to respect our women more? Why are more boys too now being molested and raped? Why is it not safe for our kids even in schools? What exactly are we, as a society, doing to put an end to this shameful aspect of our culture, yes I say culture, because let's not kid ourselves here—as rich as our culture is, it has also got this dark, depraved side, which we, and I mean us women too, tend to sweep under the carpet, hoping it will all magically go away. 
In 2012, just when we thought things couldn't get worse for women, it did. A young medical intern Jyoti Singh Pandey just 23 at the time and with a bright future ahead of her, was gang raped and tortured in a bus she was travelling in with a male friend, who incidentally was also beaten up (sorry, I refuse to call her Nirbhaya, the fearless. She has a name, and no, she was not fearless! She must have been petrified as she had man after man do all sorts of unspeakable things to her). Uproar followed, vigils and marches were held for months on end all over the country, and yet four of the convicts were sentenced to death only in 2017 and the so-called juvenile (who was “old” enough to rape a young girl but too “young” to face death like the rest of the perpetrators) was convicted to serve three years of imprisonment as was the law at that time. 
This then lead to a serious of political discussions and fast track courts to hear cases of rape—yet here we are today, protesting two more heinous cases. Earlier this year, eight-year-old Asifa Bano was brutally raped and murdered in Jammu and Kashmir. Politicians (and I'm not saying they are all bad) are once again trying to use this to their advantage as the investigations are being bungled up and Asifa's parents forced to abandon their home out of fear. Then we have the Unnao case where a 17-year-old was allegedly raped by MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar when she went to him to his residence with her father last June to seek a job. Imagine, she was quiet for so long out of fear… Just think about that for a moment. According to latest reports, Sengar has been sent to seven-day police custody and the CBI is now involved (of course, how this finally pans out would be interesting to see as we hear the four-term MLA is popular across party lines and enjoys popularity with the masses). 
While I hope and pray justice will be served in both these cases and I am happy that our usually silent PM came out strongly against these crimes and other atrocities against women, it is very difficult to actually believe the system will bring about behavioural changes in society. For the victims and families, life as they know has changed forever, and after the hype, they will soon be forgotten. Our judiciary appears to be our only hope, but not even the fear of being hanged to death deters these perverts and rapists. 
I, and many like me, have often been accused of being armchair critics. Which, of course, we are. What else can we do but vent out our frustration on social media and join vigils and protests? You say we can change by exercising our right to vote—well I've voted every single time since I was 18 for different candidates in the hope of change, but sadly nothing has changed. The girl who went through mental abuse as a child and teenager and then adult on the streets of Mumbai, continues to face the same, now as a mum, like so many other women (and men) and children in our country. 
So let's not kid ourselves here. It will take years for the system to make a difference, but we as individuals, as corporates, as news organisations must make an effort on every level to spread awareness and make sex education a must for all. On the personal front, we need to teach our sons to respect women irrespective of what clothes they are wearing, tattoos they may have, whether or not they drink and smoke… It's their life, it's their right. We also need to be practical and realise we do live in dangerous times… Just as we're taking precaution against terrorism, we need to first learn, and then teach our kids how to take precaution against rapists. I'd say have some classes on it just as we have sex education classes. 
I am livid as I write this, but I am also hopeful that we, as a community, will finally go beyond social media and protests and vigils and say enough is enough. Teach our kids young, educate the uneducated, spread awareness about rape, have sensitivity programs for our authorities that deal with rape victims and their families, provide them with protection and above all, do not spare the rapists. Fast track must mean fast track. You rape, you die. As simple as that.

Set your alarm for a super badminton Sunday tomorrow 
Saina Nehwal and Pusarla V Sindhu have guaranteed a gold and silver medal for India at the ongoing Commonwealth Games by reaching the women's singles finals. Nehwal, who had won the gold medal in the 2010 Delhi Games but missed the 2014 Glasgow Games due to injuries, overcame a stiff contest from Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour winning by 21-14, 18-21, 21-17. Sindhu, on the other hand, thrashed defending champion Canada's Michelle Li in straight games 21-18, 21-8. 
Sindhu started with a slender 11-10 lead midway into her first game, before extending the score to 19-15. She allowed Li to sneak in a few points towards the end but wrest back the lead in 22 minutes. The second game saw complete domination from Sindhu, breezing away with an 18-8 lead and closing the contest in just 14 minutes. 
Nehwal, meanwhile, took an hour and five minutes to close out her game. She started with a 5-0 lead early in the first game before Gilmour opened her account to trail 8-11 midway. But there was no stopping Nehwal who closed the game in 21 minutes. The second game also started on similar lines with Nehwal dominating, but Gilmour came back strong to square things at 15-15. From there on, the Scot didn't look back and win the second game in 23 minutes. In the decider, Nehwal surged ahead with a 7-2 lead before Gilmour reduced the deficit to trail 7-11 midway. But the Indian did not allow Gilmour to settle down and stormed into the final in 24 minutes. 
Nehwal and Sindhu have played each other three times at international tournaments. The scorecard is tipped 2-1 in Nehwal's favour. And tomorrow promises to be a cracker of a Super Sunday. The final match will be held on Sunday at 4.30am IST.

"Why did it take an incident such as this for an outrage of this sort?” 
Big happy eyes, two messy ponytails, a choppy fringe and a quirky smile—this is the face of an eight-year-old-child, who we now know as the victim of the most unimaginable violence, communal hatred and male aggression. For the last few days we have seen this image everywhere—on social media, across mainstream news channels and on the front page of every leading newspaper. And alongside the picture comes the report and the horrific details of the rape, mutilation and murder—in a temple in Kathua in Jammu, by a temple caretaker, two policemen, a juvenile nephew and five other cold brutes, who don't deserve to be called human. 
This is not the only incident of rape that has happened in India after the 2012 Delhi gang rape that shook the collective consciousness of the country. But this is one that is making us feel anger in a way that we as a nation and people, almost forgot to feel for the last six years. But why did it take so long for us to make this headlining news? Why did it take an incident such as this for an outrage of this sort? Have we become so immune to this country and its capital's status as the “Rape Capital” of the world that when women, girls and month-old babies are raped we lower our heads in shame, avert our eyes and move on without significant outrage—silently? The answer is YES. 
The extent of harassment, assault and rape is so immense, so tragic, so horrific that we as citizens don't know what we can do or how we can help. But more significantly, we've begun to feel hopeless—because we can't help but wonder if anything we do will ever help because every effort we have taken so far seems futile, since nothing has seemed to change. 
We can turn our phones and screens off, take comfort in assuming that life has gone back to normal, and remain untouched by the violence happening in completely different parts of the country, far away from home. But does life really go back to normal? Tomorrow we will wake up and seemingly get back to the mundane, we will reach into our cupboard looking for clothes, but pick a kurta over those denim shorts. When the sun goes down in the evening our feet will turn our way back home, back to the only place we think we're safe. Empty streets will seem to beckon those who believe the greatest way to bring honour to their own is to rip that of others. 
Our mothers will call us more frequently and keep close tabs on where we go and who we meet and what time we get home. We will let her because we've come to understand why she does it, this is the only way she can have peace, knowing that today her daughter was “lucky” enough to not have faced any trouble in this country. We will be asked, once again, to not get too political just so that we don't upset the wrong people. Because we all know what those “wrong” powerful people—with the power that we have entrusted upon them—are capable of doing and how they manage their way out of any and all legal trouble. 
For women all over India, no matter how long or how short the media outrage cycle of the Kathua rape case may last, we know that normal has come to mean living within the insidious rape culture around us. Because in every step we take, there's that faint voice of caution that will constantly remember Jyoti Singh and the face of the little girl in ponytails and the countless other nameless and faceless victims and survivors of horrific acts of assault, violence and rape as a reminder and a warning. But it's time to end the silence, it's time to voice our rage, against the privilege of the powerful, of our sense of robbed security and our solidarity with the ones who we have lost along the way and those who speak out against the odds. This is our wakeup call.

Here’s all we know 
Katrina Kaif's upcoming project is a rather exciting one. When asked about her journey in the Hindi film industry recently, the Bollywood star hinted at the possibility of her penning a memoir soon. Rumour has it that Kaif has been approached by a prominent publishing house to write an autobiography. Although the actor was reluctant initially as she felt it was too soon, she has finally agreed and is now on board with the idea. 
Reportedly titled Barbie Dreams (a reminder of the fact that the star has had a Barbie modelled after her), the book will focus on Katrina Kaif's journey till date—from modelling in London to being spotted by Boom's director and landing her first Bollywood break, to eventually becoming one of the most loved celebrities in the Indian film industry. 
The Tiger Zinda Hai star is expected to reveal how she climbed to the top in Bollywood by educating herself about the industry and bagging projects wisely, despite debuting with an arguably controversial movie. Fans curious about her personal life will not find details related to Kaif's private life in the read though, as it does not fit in with the book's template. The publishers are aiming at releasing the memoir as a motivational account of her personal journey—hence the decision to eliminate accounts of her private life. 
For now, Katrina Kaif is busy shooting for her upcoming film Zero alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma, and will also star in a dance flick by Remo D'Souza.

From love on movie sets to that tattoo, guest starring Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi 
When it comes to Bollywood couples, few cause as much excitement in the country as Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan. After all, she's among the Indian film industry's most respected actors, and he's a Pataudi prince with more than 60 Bollywood movies to his name. Despite not being on social media, the Khans catch eyes all over the globe each time they're spotted together. But while we all know what they're up to currently, not everyone knows #Saifeena's back story. Here's a walk through Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan's fairy tale romance. 
Having worked with Karisma Kapoor in the past, Saif Ali Khan was no stranger to sister Kareena Kapoor. In fact, the actor first met Kareena when she was just a young girl on Karisma's set. The stars first worked together in LOC Kargil (2003) and the multiple award-winning Omkara (2006), before coming together once again to shoot the action comedy movie Tashan (2008). It was on the sets of this film that the actors are said to have fallen in love. “I unabashedly wore my heart on my sleeve and it was a nice ride till I finally met Saif and we fell in love,” Kareena once said in an interview. 
Tashan (2008) 
Since then, Kareena and Saif have worked together in Kurbaan (2009) and Agent Vinod (2012). 
Just a year into their relationship, Saif decided to get inked to mark his love for Kareena. “We were in the car one afternoon in Bandra, talking about David Beckham. I don't know why I brought him up,” Saif revealed to a news channel in 2009. “And then the tattoo came up, and I said, ‘Maybe I should get one on my shoulder, would it look cool?' And [Kareena] said, ‘Why shoulder? Put it on your arm.' I thought, ‘Maybe a nice K?' and she said, ‘That's a bit ambiguous.'” The tattoo on the his forearm spells Kareena's name in Hindi, and made headlines when it was first spotted.

Despite constantly being in the spotlight, Kareena and Saif kept their wedding very private. After living together for five years, the couple sealed the deal with a week-long celebration including a sangeet at Kareena's Bandra home. The duo tied the knot on October 16, 2012. “When two actors are in a relationship, no matter what the intention is, there is a great deal of uncertainty. Our wedding resolved that. For me, it is very important to feel calm about the person I am with, and not distracted or worried. If one is happy at home, it shows on one's face, and in one's work. Kareena has made me feel secure about our relationship, so I am happy being with her,” says Saif.

After months of giving her fans major maternity style inspiration, Kareena Kapoor Khan welcomed their first baby, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi on December 20, 2016. Within hours of the big moment, pictures of Saif Ali Khan giving his wife a kiss at the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai took over the internet, and little Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi became a viral sensation on his first day in the world. “There are a lot of responsibilities on you once you become a mother. You feel that your heart is not beating inside you, but outside your body, and that is the biggest responsibility,” says Kareena. “Both me and Saif always wanted this. We used to talk about all these things. Both of us see ourselves in Taimur, and this is the most special thing.”

These days, you'll spot the Khans enjoying quiet dinners together when they can, and always taking some time out to party with their favourite people. “She has been a good influence on me, and inspires me to get things right—whether it's being disciplined about fitness and food, or how much to party. We share a healthy equation of likes and dislikes,” Saif says. While one weekend has the couple busy bringing in Randhir Kapoor's birthday with an intimate dinner, another has them hanging out with cousins for Christmas. Most recently, Kareena and Saif were spotted shaking a leg at Amrita Arora Ladak's birthday celebrations in Goa, and weeks later, we saw them enjoying a quiet play date with Taimur, Soha Ali Khan Pataudi and her daughter, Inaaya Naumi Kemmu. When the couple decide to take a break from Mumbai, you can be sure to spot them in their favourite vacation spot, in Gstaad, Switzerland.

The wardrobe MVP you need 
Priyanka Chopra's global star status means she needs a wardrobe that can keep up with her cross-continental travel. The star, who is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, was recently seen at the UNICEF Partners Forum event in New Delhi and chose a utilitarian blue jumpsuit for the occasion. Priyanka Chopra is known to add a dash of colour to her ensembles, and paired her blue Missoni jumpsuit with a pair of bold red heels by Fendi. 
The versatility of the jumpsuit is such that it can be taken from a formal event to drinks after hours. In the case of Chopra's look, the belted waist added definition to the linear outfit, while the lapel and button details added a formal touch. There are many options to choose from, if you're in the market for a new jumpsuit too. A simple monochrome piece worn with leather flats makes for a great workwear outfit. But if a cocktail event is on the cards, you can pick a style that's a little more daring. An off the shoulder style or a halter one might just what you need for an evening out.

"It affected me," the Bollywood actor confessed in a recent interview 
Priyanka Chopra isn't just one of Bollywood's most popular stars. The singer, producer and former Miss World is also among Hollywood's favourite new faces. Whether she's kicking it on Quantico as Alex Parrish or playing villainous vixen Victoria Leeds in the Baywatch movie, Chopra has been appreciated for every performance. 
Not one to shy away from any topic, Chopra recently spoke out about the subject of equal pay in an eye-opening interview with an American publication. “I feel it every year, especially when you're doing movies with really big actors, whether it's in India or America,” Chopra said. “If an actor is getting 100 bucks, the conversation will start with max, like, 8 bucks. The gap is that staggering.” 
As it turns out, Bollywood may actually be more open to addressing pay gaps than other industries. “In America, we don't talk about it as brashly, whereas in India the issue is not skirted around. I've been told straight up, if it's a female role in a movie with big, male actors attached, your worth is not really considered as much. A producer-director said to me, ‘Well, you know how it is in these big tentpole movies with the big boys. This is the budget for the girl, and we can't move beyond that,' which was, like, a measly five percent of what [the male lead] was getting. It happens in both countries, it's just that here, it's hidden behind other things. In America, everyone is so worried about being liable that they don't want to say anything wrong, but they end up doing it anyway.” 
The interview also had Priyanka Chopra share memories from her childhood, inspiring anecdotes on her parents, and the challenges she continues to face as an actor. Read them below. 
“He [Chopra's father] was man enough to say, ‘Listen, my wife does this way better than me.' And nobody even questioned it. So when I came out into the big, bad world of entertainment, I was like, ‘Oh, well the world's different than my house!'” 
“I don't negotiate—I make my [agent] negotiate. That's step one. But I think negotiating is important. I'm not someone who is demanding. I'm conversational. So when I talk money, I'm not going to be asking for ridiculous amounts that I might not be able to bring back. It starts with me being logical and saying, ‘I deserve that much in remuneration. These are the returns that I see myself bringing to the table.' And, usually most people come around when you place it like that.” 
“I just think merit should be the name of the game. Stop looking at women as women and men as men—just look at us as our ability to deliver at the job given to us.” 
“It happened last year. I was out for a movie, and somebody [from the studio] called one of my agents and said, ‘She's the wrong—what word did they used?—‘physicality.'' So in my defense as an actor, I'm like, ‘Do I need to be skinnier? Do I need to get in shape? Do I need to have abs?' Like, what does ‘wrong physicality' mean? And then my agent broke it down for me. Like, ‘I think, Priy, they meant that they wanted someone who's not brown.' It affected me. No one will say that a woman is getting paid less because she's a woman of colour, but the numbers mostly end up reflecting that.” 
“I'm actually really careful with my money. I've earned it with a lot of hard work. When I was 16 or 17, I was just about to start working and I got one modelling job. I got a cheque, and my mom was like, ‘There's no way in the world I'm cashing this.' I was very proud.” Priyanka Chopra's mother still has that paycheque framed. 
“I want to see the day where female-led movies get as much of a run as the boys do, which means the ticket-buying audience needs to be open to that. People don't go watch females in movies because they don't believe that they can be heroes. The world has to change the way they look at their heroes. Specifically how men can help is changing the ‘locker-room talk' conversation. Nothing will change until we break the stereotypes of gender in our normal, day-to-day life.” 
“I burn a little bit of plastic if I'm feeling emotional. And when I mean burn plastic, I don't go, like, shopping at Saks. I'll buy a car. I like to give myself a good life because I've worked really hard for it—I like having good homes, good cars, good clothes and shoes. I treat myself. Because ain't nobody else going to do it!”

The actor went all-traditional for an event in Mumbai yesterday 
Kareena Kapoor Khan is not the one to shy away from making risqué wardrobe choices—be it her head-turning red dress or most recent barely-there blouse and lehenga set. Yesterday, Kapoor Khan was seen at the Lokmat Maharashtrian of the Year Awards in Mumbai, where she bagged the Power Icon award. The actor, who is often seen favouring blacks and pastels, served up what may be one of her most unexpected style choices yet—a foil printed canary yellow sari paired with a neon pink blouse by the House of Masaba. The kalash printed ethnic wear line by Masaba Gupta seems popular with Bollywood at the moment—just last weekend, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was seen in a striking pink lehenga bearing the same pattern. 
Given the bright hue of her ensemble, Kareena Kapoor Khan chose a simple half-sleeved blouse with a dramatic back to pair her printed sari with, making it appropriate for a day event. Completing her ensemble were an elegant yet impactful pair of oversized gold earrings by Shri Ram Hari Ram Jewellers and her patent diamond ring. The trick to styling such a bright number such as this is to balance the proportions with right accessories, just like she did. 
Kapoor Khan punctuated her outfit with heavily kohled eyes, nude lips, hair tied back in a sleek ponytail and a tiny black bindi. This is not the only bright look the star has worn in the recent past. A few days back, Kapoor Khan was also spotted enjoying with baby Taimur in a bright yellow maxi dress and a matching robe, also by Masaba Gupta. 
Scroll through our gallery below to take a closer peek at her traditional Indian look. Want to stand out in a sea of pastels? Take cues from Kareena Kapoor Khan's recent ensemble and inject a bolt of colour in your wardrobe by shopping from our edit of bright coloured saris.

Kensington Palace have revealed information regarding the couple’s wishes for gifts on their wedding day 
When Queen Elizabeth II married Prince Philip, the couple received 2,500 weddings gifts from people over the world. When Prince Charles and Lady Diana tied the knot, they received more than 6,000. However, modern royal Prince Harry is hoping not to follow in his grandparents' or his parents' footsteps, instead requesting alongside his fiancée that people donate to charities instead. 
Kensington Palace confirmed on Twitter the couple have asked that anyone who wishes to send gifts might instead consider giving to charity. “Prince Harry & Ms. Meghan Markle are incredibly grateful for the goodwill they have received since their engagement,” the statement begins. “Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have personally selected seven organisations they would like to support, reflecting their shared values.” 
The charities they have chosen are smaller organisations and relate to the areas of HIV, homelessness, empowering women, the Armed Forces, sport and the environment. One of the seven organisations is the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women from Mumbai's slums by providing them employment opportunities, manufacturing and selling affordable sanitary napkins. You can read about all of the other charities here. 
[#image: /photos/5ce41e761dc267cc15c778a3]||| ||| Story from Kensington Palace's official Instagram account 
As for an official wedding registry, that is kept private. According to The Times, royals do create a wedding registry like the rest of us, but this is a private list distributed to close family and friends only and we'll likely never see it. The Times reported on Prince William and Kate Middleton's list from their 2011 wedding, saying it “looks like any other wedding list you'd see for any normal wedding.” 
“There is nothing particularly extravagant on it—no gold taps—just regular things to help them fill the sparsely decorated cottage in Anglesey,” a source told The Times. 
For those of us who are still waiting for our invites to the royal wedding on May 19, at least we can distract ourselves by donating to one of the couple's chosen charities.

She’s revamping airport style like a pro 
Anushka Sharma is something of a poster child for designer Sabyasachi's designs. The actor's wedding trousseau by the designer was all Bollywood followers could talk about post her wedding to Virat Kohli. Sharma's understated, grown-up sartorial vocabulary is usually about light athleisure and good tailoring, with an occasional elegant red carpet look thrown into the mix. Off late, Anushka Sharma has been spotted in light Indian ethnic wear, perhaps in an attempt to beat the scorching temperatures. Yesterday, the Pari actor chose a star printed cotton kurta-palazzo set by Sabyasachi as she headed to the airport. 
Checking all the right boxes for a relaxed summer look, the star styled her ensemble with a pair of oversized black sunglasses, flat sandals and a hold-all handbag. Despite the loose silhouette of the kurta-palazzo set, the look has a youthful quality to it courtesy the star print. The outfit is similar to another kurta set by Sabyasachi, which Sharma chose on her way back from her reception party in New Delhi. This time around, the floral motifs were replaced by stars. 
Travelling in Indian ethnic separates might strike you as somewhat radical in the age of athleisure. But Sharma makes a strong case for reintroducing the kurta in a daily context, and not just reserving it for special occasions. You can style your kurta and palazzos for work with sharp accessories and flats, or wear it on a weekend of art gallery hopping. Take cues from Anushka Sharma's airport look for cued on how to get it right.

Catch up on all that happened this week 
Ever since the Women's March in the beginning of 2017, the cause of women's empowerment has been steadily gaining steam. Fighting for equal rights, and against gender discrimination, sexual and other forms of assault, have become the order of the day, in a movement that, thanks to social media, now spans countries and continents. 
In our weekly newsletter every Monday, we aim to bring to you the latest updates from the front line—everything, big or small, that will help spark meaningful conversations in the move towards equality. Below, the updates from last week. 
– 16-year-old Manu Bhaker became one of India's youngest gold medallists at the 21st Commonwealth Games this Sunday, scoring first place in the women's 10m air pistol event at Gold Coast, Australia. The young shooter shot a record 240.9, finishing well ahead of her senior Heena Sidhu, who aggregated 234. Bhaker has bagged multiple gold medals at the 2018 ISSF World Cup in Guadalajara, Mexico and the following Junior Cup in Sydney. 
– Anne Hathaway is about to gain weight for a role, and she's informing all future body shamers well in advance. The Les Misérables actor took to Instagram on Thursday to put up a video of an intense workout, and captioned it saying, “I am gaining weight for a movie role and it is going well. To all the people who are going to fat shame me in the upcoming months, it's not me, it's you. Peace xx.” 
– Mumbai now has an organisation that focuses on LGBT healthcare more prominently than ever before. Launched last month, a group called Health Professionals for Queer Indians (HPQI) aims to sensitise and educate medical students so that they are better equipped to deal with the medical needs of the LGBT community when they start practicing. HPQI had, along with the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS), organised a conference on March 10 at the BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai, and are looking to conduct more programmes at other medical teaching institutions in the near future. 
– Indulge your sweet tooth while doing your bit for society with Spring Street Bakery. Started by Bennet and Bernie David, it calls itself a classic American bakery based out of Mumbai, and offers all kinds of baked treats, from apple pies to artisan sugar cookies. Spring Street Bakery is also a social enterprise that trains and employs underprivileged women, and uses a sizeable portion of its profits to rehabilitate and socially integrate them. You can find them at Springstreetbakery.in.

Here’s what we know so far 
It was back in July 2015 that Shahid Kapoor tied the knot with Mira Rajput Kapoor. And since their intimate Delhi wedding (and that star-studded wedding reception in Mumbai), the Kapoors have quickly become one of India's most-loved Bollywood couples. After the birth of their daughter Misha Kapoor on August 2016, Shahid and Mira Rajput Kapoor have gained admiration not just for being an adorable couple, but also for being a set of pretty cool parents. The duo loves sharing fun moments with their ever-smiling toddler, and Rajput Kapoor has never shied away from sharing parenting advice with her followers. “Most of the time I'm the strict one, and most of the time he's the one spoiling her,” Mira Rajput Kapoor once told Vogue. “He's the one sneaking in the chocolate, or giving her a little sip of his morning drink. But both of us just like to have fun with her.” When asked about career plans in another interview, Rajput Kapoor responded saying, "I am going to have another baby, and then decide." 
Can't wait to see the Kapoor family grow yet again? The latest news doing the rounds suggests that the couple may already be expecting their second baby. Pictures of Mira Rajput Kapoor showing what might just be a baby bump have already hit the internet, and #Shamira fans everywhere can't wait for a confirmation. 
In the past, Shahid Kapoor has gone on record to say that he and Mira Rajput Kapoor may consider having a second baby in the near future too. “Mira, who is just 22, would prefer to have a second kid soon as well,” Kapoor revealed to GQ India last February. “She wants to flip the norm, get the kids to a certain age and then be free to do what she likes. It wasn't planned actually, but I think we were ready for it. I was impatient to get married and have a family. My job is a lonely one. I was lonely for three or four years.” Judging by the way the actor shared the news about his wife's first pregnancy, one can expect an equally exciting announcement to come when the couple are ready.

And it's perfect for a summer wedding 
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan can master everything she puts her mind to. From attending social events with her family to fulfilling her work commitments, the actor does it all, without a strand of her blow-dry out of place. While she's known for her dedication to a monochrome palette when it comes to her wardrobe, over the weekend, our April 2018 cover star showed she can work a shocking pink with just as much ease. Attending an event in Pune where she was felicitated with the Woman of Substance title by the Bunt community, Rai Bachchan wore a bright fuchsia lehenga set from House of Masaba. Her ethnic look consisted of a foil printed lehenga and matching choli, paired with an ashy pink dupatta. 
While Masaba Gupta is known for a more playful take on prints, the kalash, tribal vase and leaf motifs on the lehenga and choli made for an ensemble that would please traditionalists. The vibrant lehenga was perfectly offset with the subdued dupatta that kept the look captivating without seeming overdone. Given the cheerful colour and gold print of her outfit, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's most recent number would not be out of place at a sangeet. The actor accessorised her look with traditional gold bangles and dangling earrings. Rai Bachchan's makeup consisted of winged eyeliner juxtaposed with peachy-pink lips, heavy mascara and straight, centre-parted hair. 
While zeroing in on your look for your best friend's wedding, invest in a cheerful printed lehenga set that scores high on both comfort and style, instead of a high-shine and heavily embellished number. Scroll through our gallery to get a closer look at Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's ensemble and find out where to shop it from.

Everything you need to know about the week that was 
With April already underway, Bollywood celebrities seem to have caught up with the summery vibes. The past week was an eventful one for the stars, whether they were easing into summer, giving fans a sneak-peek of their upcoming projects or getting washboard abs for the summer.

And you’re going to want to buy it now 
Deepika Padukone's work schedule is a not an easy one to keep up with. Lately, the actor has been spending a lot of time attending various events in the city. After attending an event in a dramatic gown by Amit Aggarwal, the actor was spotted attending another yesterday, with Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani co-star, Ranbir Kapoor in Mumbai. For the event, Padmaavat actor wore a chic mustard top by French label Chloé with a pair of blue bell-bottoms jeans. Complementing the flare on her '70s inspired bell-bottoms, Padukone's yellow blouse featured a frilled hemline and sleeves. 
While it may seem difficult to pull off both the trends in a single look, Padukone did it in a one fell swoop. A pair of golden peep toe heels and green statement earrings played off her separates. The actor completed her outfit with red lips, dewy makeup, sleek eyeliner and hair tied back in a neat ponytail. Next week, Padukone will be seen with Ranbir Kapoor again, walking the ramp for Manish Malhotra's Mijwan show. 
Displaying her knack for athleisure later at night, Deepika Padukone was seen hitting the airport in a comfortable, yet polished outfit. Her travel look consisted of a basic white T-shirt, a plaid bomber jacket and a matching track pant set by Maje. Padukone coupled her off-duty attire with her standard white Nike Cortez shoes, a pair of black sunglasses and a roomy tote bag. The actor kept her beauty look simple and fuss free with a ponytail and nude lips. Check out the slideshow below for a closer look at Deepika Padukone's looks from yesterday.

Another victory for women 
In a welcome change for women in India, there was positive news on the women's rights front today. The Bombay High Court directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to issue birth certificates to single mothers without mentioning the name of the child's father, by a prior application to the authorities. Reportedly, this applies to unwed women, rape victims, women conceiving through IVF and similar cases. 
The woman responsible behind this milestone move is a 31-year-old Mumbai resident who had a daughter through a sperm donor in 2016. Fed up with bureaucratic red tape, she petitioned the court seeking a birth certificate without the father's name. "The petitioner cannot be compelled to approach the court of law and get an order of non-disclosure of the name of the father. Therefore interference of the court is necessary,'' her petition stated. 
This is a small win on the large pile of recurring issues on women's rights, but a win nonetheless.

And more foodie confessions you can’t miss 
With mercury levels rising by the day in Mumbai, now's as good a time as any to indulge in your favourite foods (and drinks). For Bollywood star Ranbir Kapoor, this summer is all about chilled glasses of Pepsi, preferably served with exactly three cubes of ice. “The first time I was introduced to Pepsi was in Dubai. I used to go there a lot for holidays and when I saw the white, red and blue can, and tasted it, it was love at first sight!” he says with a small smile. “I do understand that in today's day and age people think about diets and sugar free options, but I think all you require are two or three sips of Pepsi. You don't need to have an entire bottle of it. A few sips can really satiate your thirst.” 
And that's not the only summer treat on Ranbir Kapoor's summer must-have list right now. Here's a peek at all the food secrets he has that you never knew about. 
What's your favourite Indian snack? I would have to say bhajiya pao! 
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten? I eat everything, but the weirdest thing would be crocodile, in Africa. It's quite soft, the meat, and it's quite tasty too. 
What was your favourite junk food as a kid? Cheese sada dosa and pav bhaji from Shiv Sagar. 
What's one food you'll never, ever eat? Tinda! Maybe I'd have it with Pepsi—Tinda in Pepsi sauce 
Who do you love to binge on your favourite snacks with? I think my friends from school—Rohit, Binoy, Abhay, Tusshar, Ishaan, Ayan and Aditya Roy Kapur. That's what we usually do, we hang out, we watch movies, we play video games. 
How do you beat Mumbai's heat? I've been in Bulgaria the last two months. It was -6°C there, so coming back to this weather is a bit abnormal for me right now. But we've grown up here, it's part of our lives, the Mumbai heat. And there's always a chilled Pepsi to accompany this weather.

"Hallelujah!" 
After a major ‘nineties nostalgia' moment, it's time for the 2000s to make a comeback. And any conversation about the best of 2000s is incomplete without Karan Johar's 2001 multi-starrer Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham—a blockbuster that not just did well at the box office, but gave us one of the most memorable characters of the decade ("Poo!"). Today, after almost two decades, the romantic-drama has acquired cult status. 
The recent revival of interest in this feel-good movie can be partly accredited to social media, with memes and listicles cropping around this film and its iconic characters. While some went as far to claim Poo (Kareena Kapoor's glamorous, OTT character in the film) as a feminist icon of her times, others have related to Kajol's clumsy, trouble-magnet character. 
No wonder then, with so many young netizens going gaga over the film, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is reportedly being remade, but not as a film. The movie will be adapted into a TV series by Indian television's czarina, Ekta Kapoor. While there's been no confirmation from neither Johar nor Kapoor, buzz is that the televised adaptation will reportedly air on Sony TV, and fans have already started speculating about the star cast the series will feature. While details on this news remain unclear, it is certain that more than a few Bollywood fans will be excited to see a childhood favourite come alive again, in an all new avatar.

Take on April in style 
Jhanvi Kapoor is now on the final leg of shooting for her much-anticipated debut movie, Dhadak, which probably means we'll be seeing more of her around town. Last evening, Kapoor was spotted in Bandra with Anshula Kapoor and Karisma Kapoor at designer Manish Malhotra's residence. Given the casual nature of the visit, Kapoor chose easy summer, a Lucknowi kurta set, for the outing. A classic white kurta set like hers is ideal for the rising temperatures—the breathability of cotton will keep you cool in the sweltering heat, while making sure you look as good as you feel. 
Kapoor styled her kurta with a classic white salwar and a sheer dupatta that bore lace detailing. In sync with her Indian ethnic separates, she chose a pair of silver kolhapuris to go with the look, with a brown Chanel sling bag added to the mix. The actor wore her hair in loose waves, finishing with a light hint of gloss on the lips. The look wasn't too different from Kapoor's on-screen look in Dhadak (she posted a picture of it on her Instagram recently). The film is all set to hit the theatres on July 6, and is a remake of the 2016 Marathi film, Sairat. 
A cotton kurta is a summer staple in almost any Indian wardrobe. Style yours like Kapoor with a classic salwar or with breezy palazzos, or even a pair of ripped jeans. You can go down the athleisure route and choose sneakers to go with the look too.

Tracking the duo’s complete relationship 
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and husband Abhishek Bachchan are one of India's most adored Bollywood couples. Be it a family puja, a quick vacation or a red carpet outing, the duo make headlines each time they step out together. “I love that Abhi is this mix of a well-mannered, chivalrous boy and a knight in shining armour,” Aishwarya Rai Bachchan once confessed to us. The two have always had the spotlight on them, but their love story is still unknown to many. Here's a look back at Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan's journey together. 
“The first time Aishwarya and I met professionally was in 1999, during a photoshoot for Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke (2000),” says Abhishek Bachchan. “It was our first film together, and I expected a diva. Instead, she was disarmingly wonderful.” The stars remained friends and worked together on Kuch Naa Kaho (2003) as well, finally falling for one another in 2006, while shooting for the music video of ‘Kajra Re' from Bunty Aur Babli (2005). Till date, the couple have starred in eight films together including Dhoom 2 (2006), Umrao Jaan (2006), and Guru (2007). 
After months of dating, Abhishek Bachchan proposed to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan during a trip to promote Guru (2007) in New York. “I was filming in New York for a movie, and I used to stand on my balcony of my hotel room and wish that one day… wouldn't it be nice if I was together with [Aishwarya], married?” Abhishek revealed to Oprah Winfrey in the couple's first interview post their wedding. “So I took her to the very same balcony, and I asked her to marry me.” 
On their wedding day, April 20, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan made a stunning South Indian bride in a traditional gold Kanjivaram sari. The star paired her regal bridal ensemble with uncut diamond jewellery and flowers in her hair. When did her new title hit her? “It was on the flight to our honeymoon in Bora Bora,” says Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. “The stewardess welcomed me on-board saying, ‘Welcome, Mrs Bachchan.' And Abhishek and I just looked at each other and burst out laughing! And it hit me, I'm married! I'm Mrs Bachchan!” 
After four years of being married, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan welcomed their first child, Aaradhya Bachchan into the world. Over the years, Aaradhya has been spotted out and about with her parents everywhere, from Durga puja celebrations to holidays all over the globe. “I spend all my time with Aaradhya, and I have one nanny, by choice,” Aishwarya Rai Bachchan says in Vogue India's April 2018 cover story. “I read comments saying, ‘Ah, she must have an army of help' and I understand the perception, but I choose this way, which means life is always busy.” 
“When she became a mother, her career took a backseat,” says Abhishek Bachchan. “Today, she does everything for Aaradhya. She is a supermom. Soon after Aaradhya was born, the media went at her about her weight gain. Nasty things were written, which really upset me. If they upset her, she said nothing. “Water off a duck's back,” said Aishwarya when she saw me perturbed.” 
These days, you'll spot Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan taking time out of their busy schedules to spend family time with their favourite people. Despite not being on social media herself, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is an Instagram regular. All one needs to do is scroll through Abhishek Bachchan's social media feed to see the star's milestones! “Over the 17 years that I've known her—of which we've been married for 10—she has remained grounded,” Abhishek Bachchan told us last year. Catch up on the duo's cutest moments together in our slideshow below.

While other actors—Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre—have been acquitted in the case, Salman Khan has been sentenced to jail time for killing two blackbucks in Jodhpur 
A court in Jodhpur has found Salman Khan guilty in the blackbuck poaching case. Others accused in the case—actors Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre, and a local—have been acquitted for lack of evidence against them. The case, which has been ongoing for 19 years, started in October 1998 when a local Bishnoi community in Jodhpur filed a police complaint against five actors including Salman Khan for killing two blackbucks on a shooting expedition in Kankani village of Jodhpur. Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre were in Jodhpur at the time, filming for Hum Saath Saath Hai. In an earlier statement, Khan had reportedly said that the animal died of natural causes. 
The group were facing charges under section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Now that he has been found guilty, Salman Khan faces imprisonment for up to six years, though the quantum of punishment is yet to be pronounced by the court. If Khan is sentenced to more than three years in jail, the actor will be taken into custody immediately and will have to move the Rajasthan High Court to seek bail. The acquittal of the other actors will be challenged in the high court, said Shivraj Bishnoi, state president of the Jeev Raksha Bishnoi Sabha. 
Among his current movie projects, Salman Khan was working on Race 3, which is under production. The actor was also going to star in the third instalment of his hit franchise Dabanng, produced by brother Arbaaz Khan. 
Post the news, many have taken to Twitter to express their views on the court's order convicting Salman Khan in the blackbuck poaching case.

Here's where you can get one just like hers 
Twinkle Khanna, who hasn't been on the social circuit since the flurry of activities around her debut production Pad Man, was recently spotted giving a cool update to the ultimate summer staples—white shirt and jeans. The separates can easily be worn at a brunch or for an evening outing, as Khanna demonstrated with her super casual look yesterday. The author stepped out in a classic white shirt with a pair of flared jeans in Mumbai. While her breezy button down shirt with rolled up sleeves was as basic as it gets, her jeans, featuring a frayed, exaggerated hemline, added sartorial cred to the simple look, and was perfect for shoe showcasing.

Keeping her beauty look city appropriate, the former actor went with nothing but a hint of eyeliner and nude lips.

Here’s how you can get her look 
Sonam Kapoor is working hard at getting her dream body. The star recently visited the celebrity-favourite detox retreat The Viva Mayr Clinic in Austria with boyfriend Anand Ahuja before heading to London, where the duo was spotted spending time together. The actor returned home yesterday, sporting a head-to-toe black look at Mumbai airport. Her jet-set chic ensemble consisted of a pair of sweatpants styled with a black over-sized coat, both by Alexander Wang and a black sports bra that revealed a flash of her toned, summer-ready midriff. Kapoor's black button down jacket not only added structure to her look, but was also a refreshing respite from the signature denim jackets spotted at the airport recently.

Opting for Deepika Padukone's favourite travel shoes, the Veere Di Wedding actor rounded off her look with Nike's white Cortez sneakers. As for the rest of her accessories, Kapoor chose a simple set of gold hoop earrings, multiple rings and a sleek brown wrist watch. Adding a touch of the '90s, the actor topped off her look with a pair of tinted retro sunglasses by Roberi & Fraud.

Here's what you can find there 
Dubai has always been known as the mecca of shopping. The Dubai Mall, which was already the world's largest mall when it opened a decade ago, unveiled a new extension a few weeks ago. The new Luxury Avenue (many are calling this an expansion of the pre-existing Fashion Avenue at the Dubai Mall) will be home to 150 retail stores, and will only add to the image of the shopping destination being the epicentre of fashion in Dubai. 
Among the stores that have already opened is a three-storey Gucci flagship, along with Miu-Miu's largest store in the world. We round up five new reasons (read: boutiques) why every fashion girl should have the Dubai Mall on her radar. 
Delpozo 
The Spanish's label's third flagship—the other two being in London and Madrid—will open in the Dubai Mall. Delpozo received a second lease of life when Catalan designer Josep Font, a trained architect, took over its creative helm. Delpozo (pronounced Delpotho), is known for its colourful, feminine, yet slightly surrealistic aesthetic. With bags and shoes now added to the fashion house's repertoire, this store is a treat for any girl who likes to go bold. 
Gucci 
Every luxury mall has a Gucci store, but this one is truly unique. The three-storey store doesn't really feel like a normal mall outlet, and includes home decor among its wares, too. Also present for the first time is Gucci's DIY service, which allows customers to express themselves through personalisation of selected products. The interiors resonate the magpie extravagance that Gucci's creative director Alessandro Michele is known for. Willow green and shingle orange are the mainstay hues of the store, with the women's fitting rooms in satin mauve, and peacock blue for the men. 
Aquazzura 
Every shoe lover worth their salt knows this label. This ‘Made in Italy' shoe brand was founded by Columbian designer Edgardo Osorio seven years ago. It is his use of tie-ups, pom-poms and fringes that make his shoes all about the fun. As a designer who believes in combining femininity with comfort, his collections always include an extensive range of flats and block heels. Don't worry—there is plenty for high heel worshippers too. The store pays homage to the Middle East with its architecture, which references Islamic design. 
Moynat 
This discreet Parisian luxury house has been under the artistic direction of NIFT graduate Ramesh Nair since 2010. Founded by Pauline Moynat in 1849, they gained popularity because of their handmade trunks. For this atelier, it all about craftsmanship. They like to keep things exclusive—from the materials they use to their style of retailing. As a result, the brand doesn't open too many stores, making the one in the Middle East their only retail point. To mark the occasion of the brand's arrival to this region, they designed a special bespoke trunk—named Al Noor—made to house the Holy Quran. Their brass Minaudière Limousine-inspired trunk could be called the ‘Bentley' of evening handbags. Its delicate, feminine, lace-like motif is balanced by the use of brass, while the trunk details give a nod to old world charm. But the best thing about the trunk is how light it is. Entirely handmade, this trunk speaks of Nair's love of marrying heritage with innovation. 
Cova 
What is a day out at the stores without a coffee break? Cova is Milan's most iconic pasticceria, and has a store in the Dubai Mall. They have a lunch and dinner menu available, but we suggest you indulge in their famous Cova Panettone. The cake's recipe has been carefully guarded since 1817, and was immensely popular in 19th century Milan. The traditional dessert is still coveted by foodies all over the world, and is proof of how traditions resist in time.

And the other highlights you need to catch up on 
Ever since the Women's March in the beginning of 2017, the cause of women's empowerment has been steadily gaining steam. Fighting for equal rights, and against gender discrimination, sexual and other forms of assault, have become the order of the day, in a movement that, thanks to social media, now spans countries and continents. 
In our weekly newsletter every Monday, we aim to bring to you the latest updates from the front line—everything, big or small, that will help spark meaningful conversations in the move towards equality. Below, the updates from last week. 
– 23-year-old Canadian model Winnie Harlow called out British tabloid the Evening Standard for describing her as a ‘vitiligo sufferer'. Harlow, who gained fame in 2014 as a finalist on America's Next Top Model, made her message clear in an Instagram post last Tuesday. “I'm not a ‘Vitiligo Sufferer'. I'm not a ‘Vitiligo model'. I am Winnie. I am a model. And I happen to have Vitiligo,” she wrote in the caption. 
– President Trump declared April as the National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month on Friday, 30th March, 2018. “Sexual assault crimes remain tragically common in our society,” the US president's announcement read. “And offenders too often evade accountability.” This is amidst accusations against Trump himself, who has been charged of sexual harassment or misconduct by up to 19 women. 
– Bill and Melinda Gates are pledging $170 million to help empower women economically around the world. The money will be spent over a span of four years “to help women exercise their economic power,” wrote Melinda Gates in an op-ed. She notes that research shows economic power is the “most promising entry points for gender.”

Need all eyes on you? Take cues from Padukone's look 
Deepika Padukone's long weekend was a little different than yours. The Padmaavat star was all over the internet, not just for talks of her finally tying the knot with Ranveer Singh, but also for her look at a magazine relaunch event. Set in Dubai, the soiree was was flocked with A-listers dressed in beautiful sartorial creations. Padukone, who graces the cover of the debut edition of the magazine, chose a black off-the-shoulder gown with a flared bodice for the evening. 
The gown in question was custom created by designer Amit Aggarwal and Padukone's stylist Shaleena Nathani. There are few things the star's lithe body frame can't make work to her advantage, and a black gown for a cocktail evening is a fairly obvious choice. However, Padukone's look came with a trail, and an embellished flared top that distinguished it from any other in the room. The story behind the concept of the look came from Aggarwal's love for dandelions. “The [concept of] Deepika's dress started with a wish that she would one day wear something specially made for her by our studio. The minute I put the pencil down to sketch, the dandelion appeared within the deepest part of my subconscious. Its form, lightness and beauty, along with its tiny linear details that make this simple flower worthy enough to be wished upon, were the starting inspirations for the dress,” he said. Nathani adds, "The structure of the top makes it very unique. Always love some drama, and this time, it comes with a mini trail. Having said that, I wanted a sense of casualness, which comes with the length of the piece." 
She accessorised Padukone's gown with a pair of diamond earrings by Mahesh Notandass, and black pumps. For the beauty look, Padukone went with her signature ponytail, heavily lined eyes and a nude lip. Others seen at the launch were stars Fawad Khan and Dia Mirza, designer Manish Malhotra and filmmaker Karan Johar. 
Take a closer look at Deepika Padukone's evening look in the slideshow below.

Acing low-key separates like a pro 
Over the past several months, Kareena Kapoor Khan has unapologetically made a case for low-key gym looks. After walking the runway for Manish Malhora's show in Singapore in a lehenga paired with a sheer blouse that showed off her perfectly toned body, the actor is back to her usual work out ritual. Her look yesterday was all kinds of casual chic. She was seen stepping out of her gym in Bandra in a pair of black leggings and an asymmetrical grey top. This time, instead of her usual roomy T-shirt, the actor chose a grey number that came with a sheer black panel at the back of her full-sleeved top.

Often spotted switching between her comfortable black slides and gym shoes, the actor topped off her look with black shoes yesterday. She took her gym wear to luxe territory by accessorising it with silver aviator sunglasses. Given it was right after her workout session, the actor bore glowing skin and freshly washed open hair. After her intense workout session, Kapoor Khan joined sister Karisma Kapoor and the entire Kapoor family for lunch. 
While going for an early morning run or grabbing lunch with your best friend, keep it classic like Kareena Kapoor Khan in a low-key gym look. Check out the slideshow to view her off-duty look closely.

The on-screen couple were seen twinning at Mumbai airport 
Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff have been gearing up for the release of their upcoming movie, Baaghi 2 with the usual round of promotions. After one such round in Jaipur, the duo was spotted at the Mumbai airport yesterday, to make in time for the release of the film, which takes place tomorrow. Making a case for couple dressing, Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff both chose denim-on-denim, with Patani picking a pair of ripped jeans, cropped white T-shirt and denim jacket, and Tiger going for a Canadian tuxedo comprising of a dark denim shirt and jeans. 
[#image: /photos/5ce41f037a66d222e9e75be6]||| ||| Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff at Mumbai airport. Image: Viral Bhayani 
Adding an interesting element to her ensemble, Patani accessorised with a black cap. Classic white sneakers would have been an obvious addition (as Shroff demonstrates), but instead, Patani opted for white Puma slides that perfectly went with her low-key airport look. The actor chose to pair her ensemble with no makeup and shiny, loose waves. If you find yourself having a moment of déjà vu with Patani's look, you're not mistaken—you have seen it before. A few weeks ago, Anushka Sharma was seen sporting a similar look at the airport—ripped jeans, white T-shirt with an olive green baseball cap. 
Disha Patani's airport look can easily be taken from the airport to a movie night with your girlfriends. The casual chic outfit is sure to amp up your cool quotient, and make movie night a fashionable affair.

Bollywood’s most adorable mother-son duo will make your heart melt 
Ever since his birth in December 2016, Bollywood fans, and possibly everybody else in the country, have been obsessed with Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. When his first solo picture hit the internet, the image spread through social media like wildfire. When he first donned a kurta, followers couldn't stop talking about the toddler's nawaab-like style. And each time Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi is spotted with mother Kareena Kapoor Khan, you can be sure the pictures are going to top trending charts everywhere. Just yesterday, Kareena Kapoor Khan was spotted taking a break from work at Mehboob studio to spend some quality time with her son, and the photos are already flooding Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. 
[#image: /photos/5ce41d9b89be3642b07ced9a]||| ||| Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi at Mehboob studio. Image: Viral Bhayani 
Dressed in blue Adidas tracks and Nike sneakers, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi was spotted looking cosy in Kareena Kapoor Khan's arms last afternoon, as the working mom made her way back on set. Busy shooting, Kareena's look yesterday was bold—a body-skimming emerald green midi dress worn with pulled-back hair and intense kohl-rimmed eyes. 
“Taimur is the most beautiful baby,” Kareena Kapoor Khan had said right after his birth. “My son is the most gorgeous man this side of the equator. There are a lot of responsibilities on you once you become a mother. You feel that your heart is not beating inside you, but outside your body, and that is the biggest responsibility. Both me and Saif always wanted this. We used to talk about all these things. Both of us see ourselves in Taimur and this is the most special thing.” 
Here's a throwback at some of Kareena Kapoor Khan's cutest moments with her son. 
Before Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi began accompanying his parents on holidays and work travels, it was this picture of Kareena planting a kiss on his head that had fans squealing with delight on Instagram. Dressed in tiny dungarees and Gucci shoes, Taimur Ali Khan gave the camera a wide grin as his mom leaned over for a quick cuddle. 
[#image: /photos/5ce41d9b89be36aa2f7ced9c]||| ||| Kareena Kapoor Khan gives Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi a kiss. Image: Instagram.com 
As the months progressed, the collection of Kareena and Taimur's sweetest pictures together has grown to include a snapshot from the time Taimur visited his mom on set, and his many airport appearances with his parents. One of the most memorable has got to be the time Kareena swooped her upset son in her arms while entering Mumbai's international airport to cheer him up. 
It's not often that Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi step out in matching outfits, but when they do, it's hard not to notice how similar the mother-son duo look. 
[#image: /photos/5ce41d9b4a30b3d82712c00a]||| ||| Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi at a party together. Image: Viral Bhayani 
Back in June 2017, Kareena Kapoor Khan twinned with Taimur (just six months old at the time) at a party at Tusshar Kapoor's residence. Dressed in shades of baby blue, the two made an adorable pair together, and have since been seen in similar looks during their holidays in Switzerland too. 
Be it his first birthday celebrations in Pataudi or a family get together for Christmas, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi's cutest snaps have always been the ones with his mom Kareena Kapoor Khan. Some of our favourites include a picture of Taimur attempting to ride a horse while his mother looks on, and the moment when Kareena helped her toddler onto a carousel ride on the lawns of the Pataudi palace. 
At Christmas, there's no forgetting the pictures of little Taimur walking into the party, with his parents holding him up on either side. Scroll through our slideshow to see all the best pictures of Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi so far.

Throwback pictures, family photos and more 
Despite not having her own official social media account, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is never out of sight when it comes to Instagram. Whether the icon is walking the red carpet at Cannes, hanging out at home, or enjoying some sports, her fans are always clued in on her whereabouts. The secret behind her super strong digital presence—apart from the paparazzi who follow her every move: husband Abhishek Bachchan, whose Instagram page is loaded with adorable pictures of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan from their time together, whether it's a family trip, festive occasions or throwbacks. 
Whether it's a festival or a quick vacation, Bachchan makes it a point to include his lady love in every important post he shares with his fans on Instagram. The captions that come with each memory are equally as interesting. Cases in point: That time he hash tagged a picture of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan with #luckycharm, the time he brought daughter Aaradhya along with him to support Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as she received the award for being the most successful and impactful Miss World (“She got the award, I got to hold little A. I got the better deal”), and the time he shared a picture of her at Cannes saying “They say a picture speaks 1000 words. Seeing this photo I can think of many more”). 
Scroll through our slideshow and you'll notice Mr Bachchan has been giving us all quick glimpses into Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's world on a regular basis via Instagram. From pictures of her celebrating Durga puja to meetings with Dalbir Kaur during Sarbjit promotions, throwback pictures of IIFA performances and fun family moments, it's all in here!

Get acquainted with her style 
She may not have entered Bollywood yet, but Suhana Khan is already a star in her own right. After all, Shah Rukh Khan's only daughter is already known for her passion for acting; remember what Shabana Azmi had to say about her theatre performance as Cinderella? Her public appearances lately have made it clear that she has a strong sense of style. As we continue to watch Suhana Khan grow, here's a recap of the budding star's most memorable fashion moments. 
When it comes to wedding wear, Suhana Khan isn't one to conform with the norm. While others her age steer towards edgier, on-trend styles of Indian ethnic looks, Suhana Khan likes to celebrate in more traditional creations. 
Most recently, the teen took over social media feeds all over the country when she attended a wedding in Delhi. After being spotted in a heavily embellished pistachio-hued Monisha Jaising lehenga, Suhana Khan went the sultry route in a merlot red and gold creation, and channelled a romantic vibe in yet another must-see lehenga—a feminine floral Seema Khan creation in a pretty shade of rose pink. 
Not one for fussy ensembles, Suhana Khan's everyday wardrobe is as casual as it gets. Just like mom Gauri Khan, Suhana seems to love spending her day in a pair of ripped jeans from her extensive collection. But while Gauri Khan pairs them with roomy boho blouses, Suhana Khan's loves bringing out her range of tank tops. Whether she's dropping by PVR Juhu for a movie night, or grabbing a bite with little brother AbRam Khan at Bandra's Olive Bar & Kitchen, you can expect to see her in this laid-back uniform.

Suhana Khan's staple look gets her trademark touch by her choice of shoes. A big fan of sneakers and boots, the teen has pairs in every hue—from earthy browns to pristine whites. Some of her coolest include those gold-detailed Giuseppe Zanotti wedge sneakers, and a pair of studded black leather boots draped with chains. 
After sneakers, bold body con dresses seem to be Suhana Khan's biggest fashion love. Be it the tangerine bandage number she wore at the Arth launch party, or that sequinned animal print mini from Gauri Khan's Halloween celebration in London nightclub Cirque le Soir, it's safe to say Suhana Khan isn't one to shy away from standing out in a crowd.

That's not to say she doesn't know how to work a more sober aesthetic. At father Shah Rukh Khan's 52nd birthday celebrations last year, Suhana Khan was spotted in a breezy black and white striped maxi that deserves a spot in every girl's summer wardrobe.

Plan your boyfriend’s weekend look 
Ranveer Singh's aesthetic is not what you would categorise under minimalism. A fan of going all out, Singh's sartorial meter is high on all things flamboyant. However, even Ranveer Singh can want to take things down a notch sometimes (and he does set the bar high—remember the movie poster-print suit he wore for the 2018 Filmfare Awards?). The Bandra native was spotted yesterday in the western suburbs of Mumbai in a (comparatively) low-key look comprising of a bright printed T-shirt, green track pants and yellow sneakers. It's clear that even the most basic separates in Ranveer Singh's wardrobe share his infectious energy—the otherwise simple white T-shirt bore a vibrant illustration that read ‘Bombay', which he chose to pair with more colour through the rest of his looks. 
The star choose green track pants and yellow sneakers, both by Adidas, for the outing. These Adidas pants have garnered quite the popularity, also being spotted on Shweta Bachchan Nanda last week. Not one to blend unnoticed in a crowd, Ranveer Singh finished off his look with a pair of red sunglasses. 
If your boyfriend loves experimenting with his wardrobe, pull out some of the most colour-happy separates from his closet to put together a look for the long weekend. 
Ranveer Singh has been sporting a much leaner body in the past few months. The actor is known to transform his looks for his film roles, and after the long hair and ripped body for Padmaavat, Singh has now taken on a more toned-down approach for his upcoming projects. He will soon be appearing in Rohit Shetty's Simmba opposite debutant actor Sara Ali Khan Pataudi, and Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy with Alia Bhatt. While Singh doesn't reveal too much detail in his social media posts, he does keep his fans engaged with teasers of the making of the films.

All the stars who celebrated with the Ambanis 
No matter the occasion, Nita and Mukesh Ambani know how to throw a fantastic party. So when it came to celebrating the newest addition to their family, it was no surprise that the couple left no stones unturned. Just days after an intimate engagement ceremony in Goa, Akash Ambani and fiancé Shloka Mehta were treated to a celebratory evening at the Ambanis' Mumbai residence last night. 
Nita and Mukesh Ambani invited their closest family members and friends to welcome Shloka Mehta to the family. Along with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, celebs like Katrina Kaif, Shah Rukh Khan, Gauri Khan, Karan Johar, John Abraham, Anupama Chopra and Kiran Rao were all spotted at the celebrations. Cricketers Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan—accompanied by wife Sagarika Ghatge—also made sure to stop by and greet the bride to be.

The Ambani residence was decked in gold heart-shaped lanterns and white, pink and red roses, clearly reflecting the mood of the celebration. For the occasion, Shloka Mehta joined her husband-to-be in front of the shutterbugs wearing a rosy pink and gold brocade gown, paired with a diamond necklace, earrings, and a bracelet.

Just like Shloka Mehta, guests Katrina Kaif and Natasha Poonawalla favoured shades of blush pink for their outfits. Even little Aaradhya Bachchan chose the romantic hue for her look. While mom Aishwarya Rai Bachchan entered the party in a strapless black Osman gown, Aaradhya smiled for the cameras in a pastel pink Gauri & Nainika dress. 
Over the past weekend, Akash Ambani proposed to girlfriend Shloka in a private ceremony in Goa. Upon returning to Mumbai, the duo made their first public appearance as an official couple at Siddhivinayak temple.

Looking for a minimal evening dress? You need to check out hers 
Katrina Kaif's been keeping busy ever since she started shooting for upcoming feature Zero. After a short hiatus from the public eye, the actor was seen attending Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement party last evening. The celebration—which was hosted at the Ambanis' Mumbai residence—was attended by a number of A-listers including Shah Rukh Khan, Karan Johar and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan with daughter Aaradhaya Bachchan, among others. Considering it was a warm summer night, Katrina Kaif's pastel number, with minimal embellishment, midi length and breezy fabric, was right on brief. 
The actor, who is known to play safe with her wardrobe, chose a pastel midi dress by Luisa Beccaria for Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's soiree. While the contrasting lines created an arresting visual detail, the sheer fabric was a good option, considering the weather. The waistline of the dress was accentuated with a shimmery belt detail, and a pair of nude strappy heels completed her outfit. She kept her makeup nude, with nude lips and a swipe of liner completing her look. 
We especially love the versatility of Kaif's summery dress—it can be worn for a formal dinner or date night on vacation. If you are in the mood to try something other than your go-to LBD for an upcoming party, Katrina Kaif's pastel number will serve as inspiration. Take your look up a notch with statement accessories and matching heels. Scroll through our gallery to get a closer look at Kaif's look from Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's engagement party:

And the lehenga she wore is everything you'd expect it to be 
Kareena Kapoor Khan and Manish Malhotra are a match made in designer-muse heaven. After showcasing his spring couture 2018 collection in Pune earlier this month, the designer went overseas to reveal his work to a fresh new audience. Last night, the designer presented his collection in Singapore with Kaj Fine Jewellery, and Kareena Kapoor Khan was there to add a special touch to the night. 
Malhotra is an ardent fan of all things ostentatious and grand, and is known for creating things that are larger than life. In the lead up to the grand night, the designer teased his followers with behind-the-scenes snippets of fittings from the Atlas bar—an art-deco themed bar in the iconic Parkview Square building. Soon, delicately embroidered gowns and lehengas, sparkling with all kinds of crystals, were seen on the lineup of the 'Pearl Collection'. 
But every good show needs a great showstopper, and Manish Malhotra doesn't settle for anything less than grand. This time, it was Kareena Kapoor Khan and Kartik Aaryan who brought the show to a close. Aaryan looked dapper in a black bandhgala with white piping detail. Kapoor Khan, on the other hand, was decked out in a soft grey lehenga, with metallic and crystal florals, paired with a barely-there, sheer blouse. 
In a video posted by the couturier, Kapoor Khan was happy to report that the show went splendidly, and that the designer had outdone himself yet again. “I love you Manish, and thank you for the spectacular evening,” she beamed. 
Scroll through our gallery for some highlights from the show.

All the facts you missed on the newest member of Mukesh Ambani's family 
Shloka Mehta is a name you will be hearing a lot of in the coming months. This weekend, Mukesh and Nita Ambani's oldest child, Akash Ambani, proposed to Mehta, his girlfriend, in a romantic outdoor setup in Goa. Of course, pictures of the adorable couple flooded social media feeds throughout the country almost instantly. Surrounded by his closest family members, including brother Anant Ambani, sister Isha Ambani, and grandmother Kokilaben Ambani, Akash popped the question in a private lawn ceremony in Goa. For the intimate gathering, Mehta wore an embellished, tiered silver and grey gown by British label Needle & Thread, paired with minimal diamond jewellery. 
The couple celebrated their big moment with flowers and traditional Indian sweets, surrounded by their loved ones. In fact, one of the most talked-about pictures from the ring ceremony is the one of Mukesh Ambani congratulating his daughter-in-law-to-be with a bite of the sweet treats. Despite making headlines over the last couple of days, Shloka Mehta is still unknown to many. We give you all the details on the newest member of the Ambani family. 
Born to diamantaire Russell Mehta and wife Mona Mehta, Shloka is the youngest of three daughters. The family, who owns Rosy Blue, has been acquainted with the Ambanis for a long time. Mona Mehta is the managing director of Rosy Blue currently, while Shloka Mehta has been the director of the Rosy Blue Foundation since 2014. She also co-founded ConnectFor in 2015, a platform that helps people do volunteer work for NGOs in Mumbai, based on their skills and time. The family lives in South Mumbai. 
Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani have known each other for years now. The couple studied together in Dhirubhai Ambani International School in Mumbai, after which Shloka Mehta attended Princeton University, where she studied anthropology. After graduating in 2013, Shloka Mehta completed her masters in law and anthropology at the London School of Economics. 
Though neither of the families have made an official statement yet, rumour has it that Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani will tie the knot this December—December 8-12 being tentative dates. The five-day wedding will most likely take place in India, and was planned and finalised by the two families during the engagement ceremony in Goa. 
The Mehta and Ambani families were spotted paying their respects at Siddhivinayak Temple upon their return to Mumbai. While Akash Ambani picked a two-toned pink and yellow kurta for the big moment, fiancé Shloka Mehta complemented him in a canary yellow sharara set. Making their first public appearance together as a couple, the two made sure to greet their well wishers before making their way home. Check out all the pictures of the couple in our slideshow.

Are you taking notes? 
Malaika Arora is known for many things, but a boring wardrobe (or social calendar) is not one of them. Just days after stepping out in a tiny pair of denim shorts and Gucci T-shirt with sister Amrita Arora Ladak, Arora was seen grabbing dinner with her friends at Thai restaurant Nara in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex yesterday. This time too, the actor kept her look summer appropriate with a white off-shoulder mini dress by Deme By Gabriella. While the flowy nature of her short number lent a feminine touch to her ensemble, the balloon sleeves kept her look on trend. 
[#image: /photos/5ce41c2e1dc267529fc7754e]||| ||| Image: Viral Bhayani 
With the warm weather finally making its presence felt in this part of the world, Arora's choice of dress is the perfect example of what to wear for a day out with your girlfriends. The actor took her look from simple to scene-stealing by adding drama via her Christian Louboutin black lace up heels. But apart from the stilettos, the actor kept things minimal and accessorised her look with nothing but a black and white Gucci clutch for her casual dinner in the city. Nude lips and dewy makeup kept the rest of her look neutral and sharp, and her sleek ponytail completed the off-duty ensemble.

Steal her look 
Swara Bhaskar, who has been prepping for the release of her upcoming feature Veere Di Wedding, was spotted attending the Poets of India event in Mumbai recently in the perfect designer lehenga inspiration for the next wedding event on your calendar. The actor is often seen wearing knock-out traditional numbers, and this time too, she shone the spotlight on the Indian ethnic wear in her wardrobe. After stepping out in an earthy lotus-print Rimple & Harpreet Narula anarkali last week, yesterday, the actor opted for a designer lehenga for the Mumbai event. 
[#image: /photos/5ce42055b803113fa08f5f26]||| ||| Image: Viral Bhayani 
Bhaskar chose a mint green brocade choli and lehenga set from Raw Mango's latest collection. The pastel lehenga was punctuated by bright pink detail. A sheer organza dupatta with a slim golden border helped balance the all-over brocade pattern on her designer lehenga choli, making it just right for a friend's wedding sangeet. 
Bhaskar anchored her outfit with nothing but a pair of oversized gold earrings that complemented her outfit. Forgoing heels, the actor finished off her look with basic flats. Keeping the easy theme going, the star went with dewy makeup, peachy lips, sleek eye liner and soft curls. 
Searching for some ethnic dressing inspiration for your summer wedding? Fret not and take style cues from Swara Bhaskar's traditional look. Swap your high shine anarkalis with a designer brocade lehenga that's perfect to dance the night away in. Balance your look by opting for a lightweight dupatta and elevate your traditional look with gold earrings and matching shoes.

On her 40th birthday, the star pens a special letter 
Bollywood star Rani Mukerji turns 40 years old today, and on the milestone occasion, the actor has penned a letter to her fans that highlights not just good memories from her 22-year journey in Bollywood, but also the challenges she has faced along the way. 
#RaniMukerji shares a heartfelt letter on her 40th birthday. pic.twitter.com/GeGHa9fM6r 
— Yash Raj Films (@yrf) March 21, 2018 
Having worked in close to 50 movies over the years, Rani Mukerji barely took a break from the film industry after she tied the knot with Aditya Chopra in 2014. Post starring in crime thriller Mardaani, Rani Mukerji will return to the silver screen for the first time after the birth of her daughter Adira Chopra with Hichki, a movie in which she plays the role of Naina Mathur, a woman suffering from Tourette Syndrome who decides to become a teacher. 
Shared on the official Twitter page of Yash Raj Films, the open letter has Rani Mukerji talk about the importance of breaking stereotypes via films, and her plans to continue changing mindsets about women in the future. Read the full note below. 
It feels great to be 40! It feels great to have also worked for 22 years and having been incredibly lucky to get so much love and appreciation. Very rarely do we artists get material that can genuinely cause social change, cause change in attitude and thinking and I have been fortunate enough to get such content multiple times. I truly feel blessed. I thank all the film-makers who have trusted me with their characters. Your characters, your films, became my identity. 
I realised very late that I was actually born to be an actor, that I was born to entertain. And I hope I have been able to do just that. As a woman, I must admit, it has not been an easy journey. I had to prove myself everyday. Actresses have to prove themselves everyday. 
A woman has a short career span, a married woman's equity dies, women are not bankable commodities at the box office, 'female-centric' (I hate this word!!) films are huge risks, a married actress who is also a mother is the final nail in the coffin of her dreams, ambitions and aspirations - these are some of the discriminatory stereotypes that we have to live with and try to overcome every single day. 
For a woman, the disparity with a man is huge and glaring in this industry. We are judged for our looks, our dancing skills, our height, our voice, our acting, how we carry ourselves every time we step out of the house - we have to be the best and yet we are thought to be extremely dispensable. I have been asking my friends to talk about their weaknesses and how they overcame them. On my birthday, I cannot skirt these massive 'hichkis' that my fellow actresses and I have faced/face and will face every day. 
I have tried to take on this sexist stereotype by coming back to acting after my marriage and motherhood. And I promise you, I will continue working and battling these stereotypes with all my fellow stunning, beautiful, kind and talented actresses and hope to see our society and the film industry mature further. I can already see the changes for the better and it fills me with joy. It makes my journey my career meaningful. I want to see many more victories for all of us. It's about time. I will be back soon - to try and entertain you, to push the envelope again. Till then, love you all. 
Yours forever 
Rani

Get all the details now 
Ever since rumours of Sara Ali Khan making her Bollywood debut with Kedarnath first hit the internet, interest around the new face, daughter of Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan, has only grown over the past few months. Now, even before Sara Ali Khan's first project hits silver screens, news about her second film has already topped trending charts everywhere. 
After Kedarnath (which is said to release November 2018, and will have Sara Ali Khan starring opposite Sushant Singh Rajput) the Bollywood ingénue will be seen in Simmba, Rohit Shetty's latest. The movie, which follows the story of Indian cop Sangram Bhalerao, features Ranveer Singh in the lead and is being released under the Dharma Productions banner. 
Earlier today, Dharma Productions confirmed the news about Sara Ali Khan joining the Simmba family with a picture of the actor with Rohit Shetty and Karan Johar. "All your speculations end here!" says the accompanying tweet. "Presenting to you the leading lady of #Simmba opposite @RanveerOfficial - #SaraAliKhan! Roaring to cinemas near you on 28th December, 2018. @karanjohar @apoorvamehta18 #RohitShetty @RelianceEnt @RSPicturez". Not only will Simmba give Bollywood fans a chance to check out a new on-screen pairing, it also marks the very first time Rohit Shetty and Karan Johar have come together. 
Just hours later, Karan Johar too confirmed the news, saying, "Sara Ali Khan in #Simmba with @RanveerOfficial directed by ROHIT SHETTY! Releasing on the 28th of December 2018 ! This winter gets hotter!!!!" 
Over the past few months, Sara Ali Khan has been spotted stepping out for several occasions. Most recently, the actor joined Janhvi Kapoor, Ishaan Khatter and Ranveer Singh to celebrate the success of Padmaavat at Deepika Padukone's residence. Until Sara Ali Khan makes her big Bollywood debut, keep an eye out for her best off-screen style moments.

Beautiful blooms, music by Sonu Nigam, and a cake you've got to see 
Hosting unmissable, star-studded parties is one of Karan Johar's many talents. And for the 75th birthday of his mother Hiroo Johar, the much-followed Bollywood director pulled out all the stops this weekend. Karan Johar made sure to kickstart his mother's birthday, March 18, on a special note this year with an adorable Instagram post. Captioned “Centre of my universe and the big love of my life!!! My mom is 75 today!!!” the birthday collage features some must-see pictures of Karan and Hiroo Johar over the years. One of the cutest of the lot: a picture of Hiroo Johar pouting for the camera with her son. 
As the day progressed, Karan Johar also shared a picture-perfect family portrait with his Instagram followers. Dressed in a vibrant floral dress and crisp white shirt respectively, Hiroo Johar's grandkids Roohi and Yash Johar sit on her lap as Karan Johar leans into the camera wearing a heart-print shirt. The birthday girl posed for the picture in a pretty lemon yellow kurta set. 
And Hiroo Johar's birthday celebrations didn't end there! Both Rani Mukerji and Shweta Bachchan Nanda stopped by the Johar residence prior to the big birthday party for a quick cake cutting session too. 
Hiroo Johar's birthday came to a close with a star-studded celebration this Sunday. There to party with the Johar family last afternoon were Bollywood stars (and close friends) Kareena Kapoor Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukerji, Sidharth Malhotra and Tanishaa Mukerji, joined by Manish Malhotra, Shweta Bachchan Nanda, and Kaykasshan Patel. 
Decorated with elegant pink blooms, the afternoon's special highlight had to be Sonu Nigam's musical performance for Hiroo Johar. The celebration ended with Hiroo Johar cutting her floral-detailed three tier cake surrounded by her favourite people. 
In case you missed it, Karan Johar also took to his Instagram page yesterday to give us all a sneak peek at the invite for Hiroo Johar's big day. Featuring a box full of white roses and a bottle of Moët, the invite was sent out to Hiroo Johar's closest friends on a silver platter. Check out all the pictures in our slideshow now.

You will definitely want this in your closet 
Kriti Sanon, who has lately been busy shooting for her upcoming feature Arjun Patiala, was yesterday spotted attending a Samsung event in Delhi. A few days after attending the Hello! Hall of Fame Awards in a gunmetal gown by Sharnita Nandwana, the actor channelled a girl-next-door look for this latest do. Nailing the art of summer dressing, Sanon paired her sky blue cotton shirt with a bright yellow high waisted midi skirt, both available at Zara. While the vibrant high waisted number added a youthful spin to her look with the colour, the separates were still appropriate for work because of their structure. For the weather, Sanon's look is a great option to take to work. 
Sanon chose dark heels with her ensemble, and kept her accessories interesting, elevating her look with multiple rings and golden hoop earrings. Sporting peachy lips, dewy makeup and hair tied back in a ponytail, she kept the rest of her look subtle and let the outfit take the spotlight.

The sweetest posts you need to see 
Alia Bhatt, one of Bollywood's youngest and most loved stars, celebrates a big milestone today: her 25th birthday. And with close to 10 Bollywood blockbusters to her name, it's still surprising to many that the actor has only just hit her mid 20s. 
Bringing in her big day, Alia Bhatt posted a special Instagram album with her followers related to her next project, Raazi. As a treat for her fans, the actor picked two unseen images from her 25th day on the sets of the film, and promised to share the trailer of the movie 25 days from today. “Movies or in this case MY movies aren't just something I do for a living,” the actor said on her official account. “It's kinda the reason I feel like I'm alive.” 
The actor also shared an adorable video of herself hanging out with her father as a one year old, captioned "Daddy's little girl. Whether you're 1 or 25." You've got to see it. 
Since Alia Bhatt's post went up, the actor's social media feeds have been flooded with good wishes from family and friends. While mother Soni Razdan put together a collage of Alia Bhatt for the occasion, Mahesh Bhatt celebrated the big moment with a throwback shot of himself with Alia Bhatt as a toddler. Known for his unique way with words, Mahesh Bhatt captioned the picture with an apt message: “Such a BIG miracle in such a LITTLE girl! Happy Birthday Alia.” 
On the occasion, Soni Razdan shared a little piece of Alia Bhatt's life with the world, sharing the story behind her daughter's name. “Alia Knightly was a lovely British Indian model and when I read that name I had decided if I had a girl we would call her Alia,” Razdan said on Instagram. “Luckily your father agreed. I had no idea what the name meant then. It was many years later that I found out it means ‘exalted'. And that you most certainly are.” Razdan also shared an important piece of advice with Alia Bhatt: “On this day, your birthday, I wish you all the best as always... but I also wish that you keep your core self intact. Your special simple sweet self intact through all the craziness and the heady ups and the not so heady downs of life ... don't lose sight of who you really are inside. Because it's that self that will be your guide and your most precious companion.” 
One of the sweetest birthday posts to be shared for Alia Bhatt's 25th birthday has got to be her sister Shaheen Bhatt's. The siblings are known to be very close, and Shaheen Bhatt's birthday message for her sister is all love. 
Along with Shaheen Bhatt, designer Masaba Gupta, actors Shahid Kapoor, Abhishek Bachchan, Dia Mirza, Nimrat Kaur and Riteish Deshmukh, and stylist Tanya Ghavri have also wished Alia Bhatt on Instagram and Twitter. Catch up on all the birthday messages via our slideshow, and don't miss the Twitter wishes below.

Malaika Arora is never behind her fitness schedule. Whether heading out for a workout or grabbing lunch with her girlfriends, the actor makes it a point to step out in her sartorial best. Yesterday, Arora was spotted hitting the gym in Mumbai. 
[#image: /photos/5ce422d57a66d278a6e7615b]||| ||| Image: Viral Bhayani 
For her look, the actor opted for textured black leggings, and a neon green T-shirt. Her T-shirt, that looked basic from the front, featured a risqué knotted back that added a cool spin to her look. Given the bright hue of her top, Arora kept the rest of the look minimal with black and white running shoes and a red bottle to keep herself hydrated. 
Given that this was right after her workout, the actor opted for a no-makeup look and wore her hair back in a bun just sporting a dewy, natural glow. She completed her outfit with tinted sunglasses. This is not the first time when Malaika Arora was spotted in a neon number. Recently, the actor was also seen hitting the gym in neon orange leggings. 
If you feel like amping up your basic athletic separates, take style cues from Malaika Arora's recent look. Style your black leggings with a bright T-shirt and finish your look with matching running shoes. Check out the slideshow above for a closer look at Malaika Arora's gym look.

The world's most famous living physicist is no more 
Professor Stephen Hawking, the English theoretical physicist, author and director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge has passed away at age 76, a spokesman for his family confirmed on Tuesday night. Hawking, a specialist in cosmology and quantum gravity, introduced the world to an entirely new way of thinking about the universe, largely thanks to his 1988 publication, A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes, which sold more than 10 million copies and inspired a documentary. He was that rare thing in our current era: a preeminent scientific mind, and a household name. 
Hawking was the world's most famous living physicist, and highly decorated, too: he was a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and honoured with awards like the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Paul Dirac Medal, the Wolf Prize, the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize, the Copley Medal, the Russian Fundamental Physics Prize, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the citation for which concluded that “his persistence and dedication has unlocked new pathways of discovery and inspired everyday citizens"). He made appearances on popular TV shows like The Simpsons, The Big Bang Theory, Futurama and Star Trek: The Next Generation, always as a version of himself. His inspiration extended far into popular culture: Pink Floyd's David Gilmour sampled Hawking for the song "Keep Talking" on the band's album, Division Bell, and Philip Glass included a version of him in his 1992 opera, The Voyage. “Not since Albert Einstein has a scientist so captured the public imagination and endeared himself to tens of millions of people around the world,” Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, told the New York Times. 
Hawking's diagnosis, at age 21, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything (for which Eddie Redmayne won an Academy Award), and he spent nearly all of his adult life bound to a wheelchair, dependent on a computerised voice system for communication. He said that he wanted "to show that people need not be limited by physical handicaps as long as they are not disabled in spirit," and he kept a busy schedule with frequent public appearances, which he largely used to raise awareness about issues like global warming, the imperiled future of the planet, and our purpose on it—which in his view, was a lot less grand than you might think. “We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star," he said. "But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.” In 2008, Hawking gave a TED talk called "Questioning the Universe," in which he stated his belief that in order for humanity (and its "selfish, and aggressive instincts") to survive, it would need to expand beyond Earth; that same year he spoke to NASA on the same topic, saying that "Spreading out into space will... completely change the future of the human race, and maybe determine whether we have any future at all." 
In physics, Hawking's name will forever be connected with black holes, but in common use, Hawking will likely be remembered best for refusing to let his disease interfere with his fierce intellectual power. (When asked about the study of physics taking him “beyond physical limitations,” Hawking famously answered, “The human race is so puny compared to the universe that being disabled is not of much cosmic significance.”) He was not terribly interested in slowing down: In 2007, at age 65, Hawking experienced zero-gravity; he also booked a seat with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to ride on a sub-orbital flight. 
His 2010 book, The Grand Design, laid bare his lack of sentimentality in regards to religion, or the idea of an afterlife. “I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first," he told The Guardian. “I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark." In the interview, Hawking emphasised the need to fulfil our potential on Earth by making good use of our lives, an effort he felt best fulfilled by seeking "the greatest value of our action."

The best part: the price tag 
Kareena Kapoor Khan had an eventful week. Recently, the actor and her sister Karisma Kapoor met Hillary Clinton, the former First Lady of the United States, at the India Today Conclave event in Mumbai. After acing power dressing in a white pant suit by Prabal Gurung, yesterday, Kapoor Khan stepped out in two relaxed looks. 
[#image: /photos/5ce42151b80311957c8f6076]||| ||| Image: Viral Bhayani 
Heading to the gym, the actor kept things easy and channelled an all-black-everything vibe with a basic black and red Levi's logo T-shirt and black leggings. The best part is the price tag of her Levis T-shirt—a steal at Rs 999. Instead of gym shoes, the actor opted for basic black slides for the look. What made her look stand out? The statement reflective sunglasses she paired with her black separates. 
Given that this was right before her workout, she kept her beauty look fuss-free and wore her hair back in a severe bun with no makeup, just sporting a natural glow. 
After her workout session, Kapoor Khan was also spotted visiting her close friend, Amrita Arora Ladak. For her second outing of the day, she opted for a relaxed grey maxi dress. Adding a pop of shine to her low-key look, the star paired her maxi with shimmery shoes and again, oversized reflective sunglasses. 
While hitting the gym or catching a flight, keep it basic like Kareena Kapoor Khan with an all-black look. For an extra helping of cheer, add a pop of colour via bright coloured sunglasses. Check out the slideshow for a closer look at Kapoor Khan's off-duty look.

The French President and First Lady are on a state trip to India 
Earlier this month, French president Emmanuel Macron had graciously hosted a dinner for all the designers (French and otherwise) who participated in Paris Fashion Week, to celebrate France as a place where people come together to design and create. Among the guests at this prestigious event were Indian designers Manish Arora and Rahul Mishra. 
Continuing this bond with India, the French President arrived in Delhi along with wife Brigitte Macron last Friday, hoping for France to become "India's best partner in Europe", he said in an interview, through this state visit. The couple have since then visited Taj Mahal in Agra and also paid their respects at Rajghat in Delhi. 
Recently, the French first lady, Brigitte Macron was spotted enjoying the street art at Lodhi Art district in New Delhi. As part of a project undertaken during the St+art Festival in 2015, Delhi's Lodhi Colony area was transformed into India's very first open public art district over a period of two months. Over 25 artists from India and abroad had contributed to this exquisite transformation through murals, installations and more. Today, Lodhi Art district has become one of the primary tourist attractions in Delhi and is visited by dignitaries round the year. 
The French First Lady's special tour of the art district was conducted by St+art's senior architect Pierre Guyot, who pointed out that Macron was particularly intrigued by some very powerful art pieces such as The Birds by Daleast or Original Aboriginal by Reko Rennie. 
Considering that Lodhi Art District was created in association with Alliance Française, the French First Lady's visit to the site highlights the Indo-french relationship of cultural exchange. 
Check out the slideshow for glimpses of the visit.

Are you taking notes? 
With the royal wedding approaching soon (May 19, mark your calendars!), Meghan Markle has been accompanying her fiancé, Prince Harry for all the Royal events. After attending her first Royal Foundation Forum in a Jason Wu wrap dress, yesterday, Markle joined her fiancé and his family to celebrate the Commonwealth Day at Westminster Abbey in London. 
For the event, the actor opted for a navy blue midi dress and a pristine winter white coat both by British designer, Amanda Wakeley. While the white coat made for a perfect layering piece, the actor elevated her look with a matching white beret that added polish to her ensemble. 
Markle completed her look with a matching navy blue clutch by Mulberry and a pair of grey Manolo Blahnik pumps, and a pair of diamond earrings. The actor kept her beauty look simple with her staples, nude lips, dewy makeup, some eye liner and wavy hair. 
Markle was accompanied by Kate Middleton, who opted for a black dress and coat for the occasion. Middleton also accessorised her look with a matching blue clutch, pumps and an oversized statement hat. Although the soon-to-be sisters-in-law are often spotted twinning, for their recent outing the duo channelled different looks but opted for same pump heels. 
While stepping out for a formal event, take cues from Markle's look and elevate your formal dress with a pristine white coat and dress up the basic separates with a pair of classic pumps. Take a closer look at Meghan Markle's look from the Commonwealth Day at Westminster Abbey in London in our slideshow below:

All loved up 
Ever since that picture-perfect wedding in Tuscany, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have sealed their spot amongst India's most loved and most followed couples. Whether they're enjoying a dance off at their friends' wedding reception or taking selfies in South Africa, the duo never fail to top trending charts in the country. If you're a die-hard #Virushka fan, you can't miss the latest on them. 
This weekend, Anushka Sharma posted one of her cutest pictures with husband Virat Kohli so far. Back from her travels, the actor shared a snapshot of herself leaning over Kohli to give him a quick kiss while he takes a selfie of their day off together. Captioned with nothing but an emoji, the picture has already been liked over 2,278,000 times! The sunkissed picture also spotlights Anushka Sharma's much-talked-about wedding ring. Rumoured to be valued at Rs 1 crore, the wedding ring is said to have taken Virat Kohli three months to select. 
"He's picked a very rare diamond ring for Anushka that has been specially crafted by an ace designer from Austria,” a source had revealed during the wedding in December 2017. “The design is unimaginably beautiful and reflects surprising elements, every time you see it from different angles." 
Just hours before Anushka Sharma's loved up post went up, Virat Kohli took to his Instagram account to share a new picture of himself with his wife too. Captioned “Chilling and how!” the picture shows a smiling Sharma hanging out with Kohli and acupuncturist Dr Jewel Gamadia. 
Just days before hanging out with his wife, Kohli also shared a picture of the view from the couple's new sea-facing home with his fans. 
Over the past month, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli have become more open about their relationship than ever before. In case you missed it, Virat Kohli shared this adorable picture of himself hugging his wife just days after Valentine's Day this year. 
The cricket pro has also been showing Sharma's latest project, horror film Pari, a lot of support. Catch up on his tweets now.

Power dressing for the win 
Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor are prime candidates on the list of Bollywood's best dressed siblings. The sisters were seen over the weekend with  Hillary Clinton, the former First Lady of the United States at the India Today Conclave event in Mumbai. While Kapoor Khan chose an-all white ensemble, Karisma Kapoor complemented her in a black midi dress. 
Going for power dressing, Kapoor Khan chose a white pant suit by Prabal Gurung. The actor not only wore the blazer without a blouse, but also paired it with flared pants that added a  '70s touch to her ensemble. The jacket featuring ruffled sleeves and a plunging neckline added an interesting spin to her all-white ensemble without the need for embellishment. 
Adding contrast to her all-white look Kapoor Khan finished off her ensemble with black Sophia Webster heels and a sleek diamond ring. Given the subdued colour palette, Kapoor Khan kept the rest of her beauty look sharp with smoky eyes, nude lips, dewy makeup and hair tied back in a ponytail. Meanwhile, Karisma Kapoor opted for a black midi dress featuring sheer sleeves by Sachin & Babi, black heels by Paul Andrew and sleek diamond Jet Gems earrings. 
Simple white pantsuits are power players in any working woman's wardrobe. While picking up a pantsuit for your next formal or black tie event, take style cues from Kareena Kapoor Khan's recent look and opt for a pristine white number. Elevate your look with black heels.

Get #InstaWorthy abs, curve-flattering swimwear, and the recipe for instant calm 
The scent of aged books mixed with the peculiar whiff of air-conditioned air takes me back to childhood summer holidays—when hours were spent rummaging in the neighbourhood library, and lazy evenings spent poring over borrowed books. Even today, the sharp smell of chlorine reminds me of summer afternoons spent in my grandmother's pool—of tan lines, sun-streaked hair and ravenous appetites. 
That's the thing about summer… it heralds the start of something special, of endless possibilities and a bit of escapism.  And while the rest of the world (March snow in London!) seems to be suffering a winter hangover, those in Mumbai can vouch that summer is here to stay. Read on for what's keeping me excited about summer—from sexy swimwear to getting in shape (seriously).

Here’s how to get it right 
Yesterday, Mira Rajput Kapoor was spotted acing an ethnic look. Rajput Kapoor was seen at the launch of occasion wear label SVA by Sonam and Paras Modi's flagship store launch at Marine Drive, Mumbai. To support the designer duo, Kapoor opted for a white and blue floral anarkali set from designer's recent collection, Dahlia. Instead of a sheer or contrasting dupatta, Rajput Kapoor's full-sleeved anarkali came with a matching one featuring floral motifs and a shimmery blue border. Given the floral print on her ensemble, the shimmery blue accents on the neckline of her ensemble and the dupatta added drama to her evening look. 
Balancing her busy ensemble, Rajput Kapoor chose to keep it easy in the accessories department and paired her look with a pair of statement silver earrings. Keeping her beauty look sleek and simple, she topped off her ensemble with nude lips, heavily kohled eyes and hair tied in a ponytail. 
If you're done with the heavy silk and embellished Indian outfits but still have commitments on your calendar that need ethnic wear, take style cues from her recent look. While Rajput Kapoor chose to go the minimal way with the rest of her look as well, you could choose to amp up the glamour of the outfit with towering heels, a statement clutch and gold earrings. Scroll through our gallery for a closer look at Mira Rajput Kapoor's floral anarkali.

Leading by example 
International Women's Day was celebrated with much uproar this year all across the globe, both on and off social media. Twitter and Instagram were flooded with celebrities wishing their fans, thanking their role models, or sharing inspiring messages of strength and courage. Some celebrities, however went a step beyond celebration. Here's our round up of celebrities that chose to lead by example on Women's Day 2018. 
Lupita N'yongo shared a picture of ‘Pantherpuff Girls', a witty mash-up of the popular cartoon super-heroines and her recent film Black Panther, while encouraging women to raise their ‘brave new voices'. Emma Watson contributed in a unique manner by curating Nat Geo's Instagram feed for the day, celebrating and posting pictures by emerging female photographers across the world. 
The Pantherpuff Girls are here for #InternationalWomensDay! We must see, respect & honor the different kinds of strength that women possess.

The sweetest, most heartfelt posts of the day 
The rise of public movements such as #MeToo and #TimesUp has inspired many, celebrities and non-celebrities alike, to fearlessly raise a voice against sexual abuse and injustice in all spheres of life. No wonder then, that the past year has been a rather significant one for women. 
On the occasion of International Women's Day, many favourite Bollywood celebrities used social media to share messages of empowerment and solidarity, highlighting the important women in their lives. Read on to see what the stars had to say. 
  
This has been an incredibly significant year for women around the world. As we continue to stand united and speak out against inequality and injustice, we will grow stronger! I'm lucky enough to have had incredible female role models in my life and today, on Women's Day, I pay homage to them all.

Happy Women's day to all the wonderful women! Today caught in the middle of heavy snow, I was happy to see women and men specially from South Asia join in to celebrate women empowerment in New York. I believe no opportunity must be given based on gender and if women, who have immense potential, are given an equal platform, they can do wonders not only for themselves or their community but for the world! #proudfemale #womensday

Featuring Nicole Kidman, Neelam Gill and more 
What happens when Hollywood icon Nicole Kidman jumps into a feel-good music video with Indian origin British beauty Neelam Gill, Russian philanthropist (and one of Vogue India's October 2017 cover stars) Natalia Vodianova, and Canadian model Winnie Harlow? 
This International Women's Day, some of the coolest, most-followed female personalities from all over the globe sang along to Aretha Franklin's version of '60s single ‘Respect' to share one strong, simple message: that every individual, irrespective of gender, age or colour, deserves respect. 
While Winnie Harlow kicks off the happy video by jumping on her bed in celebration, Nicole Kidman passionately head bangs along to the iconic song's beat, and Halima Aden, the first woman to wear a hijab in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant, joins in surrounded by acres of snow. You'll also spot plus-size model Ashley Graham busting a move for the camera, and pop band Haim coordinating their moves to perfection. Watching individuals from all over the world come together with music is enough to make you want to stand up and join in, no matter where you're watching from. 
Fun fact: ‘Respect' was originally written and released by American artist Otis Redding in 1965. It was two years later that Aretha Franklin added her own twist to the song's lyrics, changing its meaning to transform the track into a feminist favourite. This is one you've got to add to your power playlist, if you haven't already.

Lightweight and breezy 
Karisma Kapoor was spotted last attending HRVY's (Harvey Leigh Cantwell) concert in easy separates, and yesterday the actor was seen attending the Rotary Club Awards in Mumbai. Favouring colour of the moment, white, the actor went the traditional route in a sheer white Sabyasachi sari, featuring a wide border with a hint of intricate embroidery. While the golden embellished work on the border of the sari lent it a dressy appeal, the minimal embroidery on the sari elevated her sheer ensemble. Instead of a dramatic blouse, the actor paired her sari with a simple white blouse. 
Her outfit was helped by her choice of jewellery—white choker set and sleek drop earrings. Adding a dash of drama, Kapoor topped off her look with a golden embellished clutch went perfectly with the border of her sari. To go with her traditional ensemble, nothing would do but the star's trademark combination of dewy makeup, nude lips and heavily kohled eyes. This is not the only white look the star has worn in the recent past. Kapoor was also seen in a white Manish Malhotra lehenga at a wedding. 
Searching for some ethnic wear inspiration? Look no further than Karisma Kapoor's look. Swap your sharara and anarkali sets in favour of an elegant white sari. The trick to styling a basic number such as this is to balance the simplicity with the right accessories. Elevate your look with matching earrings, heels and embellished clutches. Scroll through our gallery above to take a closer look at Karisma Kapoor's ethnic style.

Meet Busa and Friends 
Necessity is the mother of inventions. Designer Anavila Misra who is a key player in the sari revivalist movement in the Indian fashion industry, comes from a place of finding a solution with her new line of children's toys. “As parents, we want to teach children about sustainability, about our culture, about our folktales, and there is no material representation of it to explain it to them. You will find toys that are to do with technology, mass made and plastic, and I wanted to add a little more to that offering,” the designer says of the intent behind the project. 
The first prototypes for the collection were made for Misra's niece who she likes to read to (and also stars in the debut campaign). “If we want girls to wear saris more often, they need to relate to it,” she says. The collection is called ‘Busa and friends'—Busa meaning little sister in Sanskrit and comprises of dolls and animals. 
There are playful rabbits, naughty monkeys, loyal puppies, giraffes and dolls in saris for young children. Each of these have been handcrafted using organic fabrics and painstakingly embroidered where synthetic or hard materials would have otherwise been used. 
The product offering is currently available only at Misra's store. “Even if 10 mothers in the country have the same thought as me and are looking for these toys, I consider this a success,” she says, nervous yet excited about her new line, which starts at Rs 1,200. 
In a world dangerously dependent on technology, be it for professionally or for entertainment for children, Misra proves that education sustainable life choices can start as young as possible.

Don't miss these adorable family photos 
March 6 marked Janhvi Kapoor's 21st birthday. Given that the upcoming actor's mother, Sridevi, passed away mere days before the occasion, the Kapoor family came together in a big way yesterday to show their love and support for the birthday girl. 
Last evening, Janhvi Kapoor celebrated her birthday with an intimate cake cutting session surrounded by family. Joining Boney Kapoor and Khushi Kapoor at the get-together were Anshula Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor, and siblings Sonam and Rhea Kapoor. Janhvi's uncle Sanjay Kapoor took charge of the camera, capturing several snapshots of the Kapoor girls enjoying their time together. One of the best videos from the evening is that of Janhvi Kapoor cutting one of her (six!) birthday cakes as her family cheers her on. 
Before meeting her closest family members last evening, Janhvi Kapoor spent her big day honouring a birthday tradition set by her late mother: spending a few special hours at an old age home. Pictures of the actor surrounded by cakes during her visit have already hit the internet, and so has this touching video of the old age home's residents singing for Janhvi with big smiles. 
In case you missed it, one of the first people to share some birthday love with Janhvi Kapoor yesterday was cousin Sonam Kapoor. The actor took to her Instagram page to wish Janhvi and share a moving message with her. “To one of the strongest girls I know, who became a woman today,” Sonam captioned her post. “Happy birthday jannu.” Janhvi also received social media wishes from designer Manish Malhotra, who shared a close relationship with Sridevi. 
Prior to her birthday, Janhvi too shared a moving note on her hopes for the future. She will soon be seen making her silver screen debut this July with Dhadak. Scroll below to check out all the pictures from her 21st birthday.

Perfect for a fairy tale wedding 
There's no denying Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's love for black in her everyday wardrobe, but when it comes to Indian wear, the actor is a clear champion for embellished whites. (Remember her ivory high-shine lehenga from Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's Mumbai reception?) Yesterday, Rai Bachchan was spotted attending the Smile Train India event at Taj Lands End, Mumbai, making a case for the lighter end of the monochrome spectrum. 
Known to be partial to the work of Manish Malhotra, for the occasion, the actor went with a high-shine anarkali set by the designer. As is Manish Malhotra's signature, the full-sleeved anarkali featured intricate silver embroidery, making it perfect for an evening soirée. To go with the voluminous nature and busy detailing of the anarkali, the actor offset her look with a sheer dupatta that came with embroidered, tasselled border. 
Rai Bachchan completed her floor-grazing ensemble with a pair of silver heels that went with her pristine look. Keeping her accessories minimal, the actor wore nothing but a diamond ring. Her makeup complemented her look with a dewy base, heavily kohled eyes, pink lips and wavy hair. 
Have a wedding to attend? Look no further and take a leaf out of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's style book. With ivory ethnic wear becoming the norm for weddings, ditch your bright coloured ensembles and invest in a high-shine number. Accessorise your look with silver earrings and matching heels. Scroll through our gallery for a closer look at Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's all-eyes-on-me anarkali.

Acing off-duty style 
Post the release of her much awaited movie Pari, Anushka Sharma is already gearing up for her next project Sui Dhaaga. After spending some quality time with her husband, cricketer Virat Kohli in Mumbai, yesterday, Sharma was spotted at the airport. 
Sharma sported a carefree look for her trip. Known to favour denim while catching flights, the actor once again opted for a pair of ripped jeans and a white cropped T-shirt by Tommy Hilfiger. While the midriff-baring T-shirt made for a perfect summer staple, it was Sharma's busted jeans that stole the show. A basic T-shirt and jeans combo can be dismissed as low-key, but leave it to Anushka Sharma to take the no-frills uniform and give it a makeover. 
Adding a cool girl spin to her ensemble, the actor upped the ante via an olive green baseball cap and topped off her look with classic white sneakers. Sharma accessorised her look with nothing but a sleek black watch and matching backpack. Keeping rest of her look minimal, the actor went with dewy makeup, nude lips and hair tied back in a ponytail. 
Come summer, take cues from Anushka Sharma's recent look and choose easy wardrobe staples—a classic white T-shirt, ripped jeans and sneakers are perfect if you're stepping out for a movie with friends. Scroll through our gallery to get a closer look at Anushka Sharma's travel ensemble.

"To one of the strongest girls I know" 
  
Just days after Sridevi's untimely demise this February, the late Bollywood icon's elder daughter, Janhvi Kapoor, turns 21 today. And to support her young cousin on her birthday, Sonam Kapoor has taken to her Instagram account to share a heartfelt message. 
Shared just hours ago, Sonam Kapoor's birthday post for Janhvi Kapoor came captioned, “To one of the strongest girls I know, who became a woman today. Happy birthday jannu.” Earlier today, Janhvi Kapoor responded to her cousin on Instagram with much love. The post has also given fans of the Kapoor family a chance to share their best wishes with the birthday girl. 
Along with Sonam Kapoor, designer Manish Malhotra has also shared a message for Janhvi Kapoor today. The designer, who was known to share a special friendship with Sridevi, posted a throwback selfie of himself with both Janhvi Kapoor and Sridevi, saying, “Happy birthday my dearest @janhvikapoor May God bless you with happiness, love, peace and just everything.” 
Prior to her birthday, Janhvi Kapoor addressed the death of her mother with a moving note shared on her official Instagram profile last week. “On my birthday, the only thing I ask of all of you is that you love your parents,” Kapoor wrote. “Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his “Jaan”. She was so much more than just an actor and wife. She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles. It mattered a great deal to her to give love and get love… She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy. So let's be that. Let's be full of only good and give only love. That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something.” 
As the day continues, one can expect to see several more birthday wishes to pour in for Janhvi Kapoor today. The actor will be seen making her Bollywood debut later this year opposite Ishaan Khatter in Dhadak.

From Oprah Winfrey to Malala Yousafzai, they tell it like it is 
Woman's suffrage movements that date back to the late 1800s. The women's liberation movement of the 1960s. The black feminism movement of the 1970s. The #MeToo movement last year, that has continued to gain momentum in 2018. Beyond these, there are thousands of global and local women's movements, smaller and larger in scale, less conspicuous yet equally relevant that fly under the radar of the media… but that continue to exist, relentlessly fighting battles, for all women's rights. 
Whether it's for basic fundamental rights that are perhaps still inaccessible to women in small, isolated parts of the world (issues like female infanticide, child marriage, rape in marriages, and more continue to exist), or whether it is more powerful, privileged women publicly fighting for issues like wage equality, the right to marry who they want, or waging a war against sexual harassment, stories of women fighting to be heard, and for equality, are everywhere. 
If you're lucky enough to have access to an internet connection, and find yourself overwhelmed by a situation in your life as a woman, we think there's no one better than those who have overcome the odds, to inspire you. Read on for a round-up of inspirational quotes from the women who have shown us how it's done (again, and again). 
  
Image: Getty 
Born into poverty to a single teenage mother, she has publicly stated she was molested as a teenager. Fighting her personal odds, today she is a powerful media entrepreneur, actor, producer, philanthropist and global icon, among many other celebrated titles. At the 2018 Golden Globes, amidst the #MeToo outrage, she accepted the Cecil B. DeMille Award (for outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment).  As the first black woman—and the 15th woman overall—to win, the American icon gave a rousing speech, telling women everywhere to take heart, for the world is changing for the better. 
Quotable quotes: "I want to say that I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times, which brings me to this: What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have, and I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories... I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say 'me too' again."

Her paternal grandmother, Pauline Perlmutter Steinem, was chairwoman of the educational committee of the National Woman Suffrage Association and a delegate to the 1908 International Council of Women—and with such illustrious genes, it's no surprise that she went on to become an outspoken feminist, journalist, and nationally-recognised social political activist for the American feminist movement. 
On January 21, 2017, at the Women's March in Washington DC—the largest public rally for women's right at the time—she gave a fiery speech, urging women everywhere to unite, claim their lives, and own their truth. 
Quotable quotes: “We are here and around the world for a deep democracy that says we will not be quiet, we will not be controlled, we will work for a world in which all countries are connected. God may be in the details, but the goddess is in connections. We are at one with each other, we are looking at each other, not up. No more asking daddy. 
We are linked. We are not ranked. And this is a day that will change us forever because we are together. Each of us individually and collectively will never be the same again. When we elect a possible president we too often go home. We've elected an impossible president, we're never going home. We're staying together. And we're taking over. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Make sure you introduce yourselves to each other and decide what we're gonna do tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and we're never turning back."

The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, this Pakistani activist for female education has survived an assassination attempt by Taliban activist to go on to set-up the Malala Fund and relentlessly fight for the right to female education. Accepting her Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, she gave an inspiring speech, uniting all those that have suffered the same atrocities, and that are fighting the same fight as her—reminding us that we are never alone. 
Quotable quotes: “When my world suddenly changed, my priorities changed too. I had two options, one was to remain silent and wait to be killed. And the second was to speak up and then be killed. I chose the second one. I decided to speak up. The terrorists tried to stop us and attacked me and my friends on 9th October 2012, but their bullets could not win. We survived. And since that day, our voices have only grown louder. I tell my story, not because it is unique, but because it is not. It is the story of many girls… Though I appear as one girl, one person, who is 5ft 2in tall, if you include my high heels. I am not a lone voice, I am many. 
I am Shazia. I am Kainat Riaz. I am Kainat Somro. I am Mezon. I am Amina. I am those 66 million girls who are out of school.” 
Image: Getty 
The Nigerian author is well known for her range of novels, short stories and nonfiction, but what brings here to the forefront of the women empowerment movement is We Should All Be Feminists, Adichie's 2012 TEDx talk, first delivered at TedX Euston. It inspired her book-length essay, We Should All Be Feminists. An excerpt from the speech where the African feminist shares her views on gender construction and sexuality: 
Quotable quotes: “I am angry. Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice. We should all be angry. Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change, but in addition to being angry, I'm also hopeful because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better. And this is how to start. We must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently.”

The American funny woman may be an award-winning actor, writer, producer and TV host, but she makes it to our list for her LGBT activism. At a time when homosexuality was still hidden away in the closet, in April 1997, a Time cover featured DeGeneres and her iconic words “Yep, I'm Gay.” Here's what we loved about her interview, as she credits her parents at a time for being supportive when it was a taboo subject, reminding us that we don't always have to fight our fights alone. 
Quotable quotes: “I've been really lucky. I have a really great family. I have parents who understand. My mother understands, now even more so. My father is supportive. My dad said the most hilarious thing when I told him what I was going to do on the show. He said, “You're not going to go all flamboyant, are ya?” I was like, “Yeah, Dad, I'm going to completely change. I'm going to start wearing leather vests. I'm going to get one of those haircuts that they all have.”

Here, we've compiled our favourites.

Bookmark her look 
Kareena Kapoor Khan took some time off her busy work schedule last week, and was seen with her son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi and Saif Ali Khan in Rajasthan, where he is shooting for an upcoming film. After the short trip, the actor was spotted returning at the Mumbai airport. 
Welcoming the summer season, Kapoor Khan opted for a fuss-free ensemble for her recent travel look. Instead of her usual T-shirts and sweatshirts, the actor chose a pastel peach kurta featuring understated tone-on-tone embroidery and paired it with easy white pants. Adding a summery touch to her ensemble, Kapoor Khan swapped her trusty Birkin in favour of a straw bag. 
The actor accessorised her look with nothing but a sleek gold watch and topped it off with Fizzy Goblet's golden jutties featuring mirror detailing. Trademark black sunglasses and hair tied back in a bun completed her travel ensemble. 
While Saif Ali Khan stayed back in Rajasthan, Kapoor Khan was accompanied by her frequent travel companion, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, who was dressed in a red T-shirt and navy blue track pants. 
Kapoor Khan's kurta set made for a refreshing change from the sweatshirt-leggings combination usually spotted at the airport. While updating your summer wardrobe, take cues from her ensemble and invest in fuss-free kurtas. The heat presents the perfect opportunity to sport one to work or while grabbing lunch with your girlfriends. Accessorise your look with matching jutties and a straw bag. Scroll through our gallery to take a closer look at Kareena Kapoor Khan's look.

From bold lips to big curls 
Oscars 2018 is undoubtedly one of the most awaited nights in the film industry, for the decadent red carpet and the winners alike. Every year, some of the best films and the people behind those films come together to celebrate cinema from around the world. Held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, this year, the night is being hosted by American late night television host and comedian Jimmy Kimmel. Of course, the arrivals started way before the actual ceremony, and the red carpet looked as beautiful as ever. The Oscars 2018 red carpet this year included everyone from Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone and Nicole Kidman to Jane Fonda, Lupita N'yongo, Margot Robbie, Zendaya and Sandra Bullock. 
As every year, we spotted a number of stunning hair and makeup looks on the red carpet. Celebrities were seen in hairstyles including romantic side buns, classic Hollywood waves, hair turbans (we're looking at you, Rita Moreno), a straight blowout courtesy Emma Stone, big, open curls by Jennifer Lawrence, sleek top knot by Zendaya and a lot of middle-parted hairstyles too. 
For makeup, the Oscars 2018 red carpet attendees opt for a lot of soft, nude lips in both beige and pink tones. When it comes to bright lips, Eiza Gonzalez chose a fresh matte orange, Salma Hayek and Taraji P Henson wore berry hues, St Vincent paired her all black outfit with a classic red, Jennifer Lawrence chose a dusty coral and Gal Gadot and Nicole Kidman chose brick red lipstick as their winner. 
Check out the gallery below for a look at all the hair and makeup looks from the Oscars 2018 red carpet.

What your favourite Hollywood celebrities wore 
As is tradition, Oscars 2018 took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. And like every Academy Awards ceremony, there was no dearth of stunning ensembles seen on celebrities. In what was expected to be another red carpet about activism, stars arrived in their sartorial best choosing to stay away from campaigning through their attire this night. 
Ever since the #MeToo campaign gained momentum, Hollywood stars have left no stone unturned in reiterating the importance of raising awareness and showing solidarity to the victims of sexual abuse, the red carpet being one of the platforms to demonstrate which side they stood on. The Golden Globes saw an all-black red carpet this year as did the BAFTAs. At the Grammys, stars walked in in black outfits and white rose. Each time a host asks a celebrity the overused “What dress are you wearing?” questions, stars have yet another reason to direct the conversation towards a cause far greater than the label on their backs. However, Oscars 2018 were about celebrating the best in the industry and just that. 
Priyanka Chopra, who was expected to make an appearance to what would have been her third Oscars red carpet was unable to make it. But the night wasn't without its stars. We saw several white gowns—Margot Robbie, Jane Fonda, Mary J. Blige and Laura Dern. Meryl Streep was seen in a bold red gown—an unlikely choice for the star who has often favoured neutrals and monochrome in the past. Viola Davis chose a vibrant pink number by Michael Kors meanwhile Jennifer Garner chose royal blue. Metallics and powder pink were amongst the popular choices seen at the Oscars red carpet. Gal Gadot in Givenchy and Jennifer Lawrence in Dior made a case for high shine. Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf and Elisabeth Moss went with macaron pink. The men looked dapper as ever in their tuxedos.

"I didn't have to rely on anyone or anything because the only person I ever needed was you" 
After public statements by Boney Kapoor and the rest of the Kapoor family, Janhvi Kapoor has addressed the death of her mother, Sridevi, through an emotional note. The actor posted a letter addressed to Sridevi on Instagram, along with a gallery that shows the family in some special moments together. "Every time I close my eyes, I only have good things to remember. I know it's you doing that," Janhvi writes in the letter. "You were a blessing in all our lives, we were blessed to have had you for as long as we did." 
Accompanying the letter and the pictures is a note for her followers. "Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were. Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it," she appeals to the public in the note. Read the entire statement and see the Instagram post, below. 
"On my birthday, the only thing I ask of all of you is that you love your parents. Cherish them and devote yourself to making them feel that love. They have made you. And I ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace. Let the love and adulation you'll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa. And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world. Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were. Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it. Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who's entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love. Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his “Jaan”. She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife. She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles. It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love. For people to be good and gracious and kind. She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy. So let's be that. Let's be full of only good and give only love. That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something. The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form. That's what she stood for. Dignity, strength and innocence. 
Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days. It's given us hope and strength and we can't thank you all enough."

Before the Academy Awards, Vogue revisits Sally Hawkins's most memorable film looks so far 
Before finding success on the silver screen, Sally Hawkins was a stage actress in London's West End, reprising Shakespearean roles in the likes of Romeo and Juliet. From stage to screen, the English actress broke onto the scene by way of Mike Leigh's All or Nothing in 2002, where she portrayed the teenage daughter of a working class family. 
Since then, she's become somewhat of a regular in indie films, whether portraying a 1960s feminist activist donning a turquoise dress in Nigel Cole's Made in Dagenham or a mom in a oatmeal-coloured cardigan for Richard Ayoade's 2010 directorial debut, Submarine. That being said, Hawkins is no stranger to Hollywood either, stepping into a hazmat suit for Gareth Edwards's 2014 remake of Godzilla. Last year she landed her biggest role yet, in Guillermo del Toro's critically-acclaimed fantasy, The Shape of Water, portraying the lover of a mysterious amphibious creature. Will Hawkins bag the Best Actress award, beating out the likes of Frances McDormand, Saoirse Ronan, Meryl Streep and Margot Robbie? Ahead of the Oscars, Vogue revisits her life on-screen.

Vogue revisits her most memorable looks from the silver screen 
Frances McDormand is no stranger to Awards season. She is, after all, one of the few talents to ever receive the Triple Crown of Acting—raking in an Oscar, a Tony, and two Emmys already. This year alone she has already won Best Actress at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes. The American actor is a Coen Brother regular, starring in a number of films by the directors, including the 1997 cult favourite Fargo, and more recently Burn After Reading and Hail, Caesar! With five Oscars nominations—and a Best Actress win for Fargo—already under her belt, McDormand's life on film is an eclectic mix of personalities and outfits. 
Remember her grungy look from Lisa Cholodenko's Laurel Canyon, sporting a worn-in KISS T-shirt? Or the outfits she donned as the middle-aged mother of 12-year-old Suzy from New England, colourful headscarf et al, in Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom? Whether it's reprising a vindictive mother seeking justice for her daughter in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, donning jumpsuits and workwear, or the unpretentious wife of a former music maven prancing around in an Adidas tracksuit in This Must Be The Place, McDormand's outfits are as distinct as the roles she plays. Will she add yet another Best Actress at Oscars 2018 to her accolades next? Here, Vogue looks back at her most memorable on-screen looks to date.

Sridevi's family makes an appeal to her fans in a statement 
All this week, fans of Sridevi have been reeling from the shock of her sudden demise last Saturday. With her mortal remains now cremated, the family has taken time from grieving to release public statements. Sonam Kapoor, Rhea Kapoor and Anil Kapoor all took to Instagram to post a few words for the deceased actor and her legacy, and the need to respect the family's right to grieve in privacy, especially for her daughters, Janhvi and Khushi Kapoor. 
“The past few days have been trying times for us as a family. Today, particularly, has been one of the hardest. We laid to rest a beautiful soul who has gone too soon. 
"She leaves behind a legacy that is unique. Her talent was undeniable, her beauty unmatched and her ability to connect with the audience was legendary. Sri had the same connect with her family as well,” says the post shared by Sonam, Rhea and Anil Kapoor. 
“This outpouring of love is the memory that we would like Khushi and Janhvi to have of their mother... a woman who was loved unquestionably by everyone. Let us all who loved Sri, envelope her two little ones, her life, as she often called them, with as much or more love than we gave Sri so that they can live their lives ahead with a little less ache in their hearts.” 
Boney Kapoor made a separate statement through Sridevi's personal Twitter account, to thank family, friends, colleagues, “and countless fans of my Sridevi who have stood by us like rocks,” he says in the post. “To the world, she was their Chandni... the actor par excellence... their Sridevi... but to me she was my love, my friend, mother to our girls, my partner. To our daughters, she was their everything... their life. She was the axis around which our family ran,” he goes on to say, while expressing his family's need for privacy at the moment. 
"Losing a friend, wife and mother of your two young daughters is a loss inexplicable in words. 
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my family, friends, colleagues, well-wishers and all of you countless fans of my Sridevi who have stood by us like rocks. I'm blessed to have the support and love of Arjun and Anshula, who have been such pillars of strength for myself, Khushi and Janhvi. Together, as a family we have tried to face this unbearable loss. 
To the world, she was their Chandni... the actor par excellence... their Sridevi... but to me she was my love, my friend, mother to our girls, my partner. To our daughters, she was their everything... their life. She was the axis around which our family ran. 
As we bid goodbye to my beloved wife, and Khushi and Janhvi's mama, I have a sincere request. Please respect our need to grieve privately. If you need to talk of Sri, let it be of the special memories, that connect each of you to her. She was, and is an actor that is irreplaceable. Love and respect her for that. The curtains never come down on an actor's life because they shine on the silver screen forever. 
My only concern at this time is to protect my daughters and find a way to move forward without Sri. She was our life, our strength and the reason we always smiled. We love her beyond measure. 
Rest in peace, my love. Our lives will never be the same again.” 
Our thoughts are with the family in this difficult time.

Here why we are fans 
Ever since Meghan Markle and Prince Harry announced their relationship, the couple has been making headlines whenever they step out. Yesterday, the actor was spotted attending her first annual Royal Foundation Forum at the Aviva building in London. Markle was also accompanied by her fiancé, Prince Harry and soon-to-be sister-in-law, Kate Middleton. 
Keeping in view the formal nature of the event, Markle chose for an understated navy blue wrap dress by Jason Wu. The extended lapels of the dress added interest to the look while the sleek belt accentuated her waistline. Complementing Markle's outfit, Kate Middleton also opted for a royal blue dress by Séraphine. 
The actor paired her dress with a simple pair of black Aquazzura pumps. Markle accessorised her look with nothing but a sleek bracelet. With the spotlight on her dress, the actor kept her beauty look simple with her staples: nude lips, dewy makeup and wavy hair. 
You can try Meghan Markle's versatile wrap dress for your next work meeting. Dress up the basic with a pair of classic pumps. Take a closer look at Meghan Markle's look from the Royal Foundation Forum in our slideshow below:

Style files of the star nominated for 'The Post' 
Since her debut in 1977 with the film Julia, Meryl Streep has built a red carpet repertoire around three signatures: sharply tailored blazers, monochrome colour palettes and elegant off-the-shoulder dresses. Throughout the years, the Kramer vs. Kramer star's penchant for jackets has varied from cropped styles which emphasise the waist—see the ruffled Vivienne Westwood bolero she wore in 2012—to longer, more fluid coverups and tailored blazers with super-sized shoulder pads or heavily embellished with sequins. Where floor-length dresses are concerned, she often opts for classic styles that emphasise the upper body with off-the-shoulder details, delicate draping and plunging V-necks. Remember the regal Lanvin number she wore to pick up her third Best Actress Oscar statuette in 2012? 
Since 2015, A-list stylist Micaela Erlanger has added bold colours and unexpected prints to the Out of Africa actress' wardrobe. Note the snakeskin-print Prada dress Streep wore to attend the premiere of Hail, Caesar! in 2016 and the pink, red and burgundy high-neck Valentino dress from the Costume Designers Guild Awards in 2017. 
Ahead of her next Oscars 2018 appearance on May 4, Vogue looks back through Meryl Streep's best red carpet moments to date.

This limited-edition collaboration needs to be on your wish list 
Take a peek inside any fashion girl's closet and you're likely to spot a pair of sneakers from one of Adidas Originals and Pharrell Williams' wildly popular collaborations (raise your hands if you're guilty of being waitlisted). So, it comes as no surprise that the sportswear giant and singer have joined forces to curate yet another capsule collection. Taking its cues from the festival of colour, HU Holi Adicolour comes packed with inherently playful designs in a happiness-inducing palette of blue, yellow, red and green. The best part? The powder-dying technique used puts an end to your twinning troubles by ensuring that no two pieces are alike. While the reinvented Tennis Hu Pk is one of the star shoe styles, the collection also sees four track essentials—tops, T-shirts, shorts and pants that will see you through countless coffee runs and shopping sprees.

Are you taking notes? 
With her hectic schedule that involves back-to-back travel, Deepika Padukone has mastered on-the-go dressing. From comfortable bombers to effortless track pants, the actor makes sure to balance comfort and style while travelling. After stepping out in cropped T-shirt and wide-legged jeans last week, yesterday the actor was spotted again at Mumbai airport. 
Making a case for utilitarian travel dressing, for her most recent travel look Padukone opted for a white Nike sweatshirt and roomy black leather pants. Leather pants have the bad reputation of being uncomfortable, but the silhouette Padukone chose made it a good option as a travel outfit. The warm sweatshirt was perfect cold flights, while the cropped leather pants elevated her otherwise basic athleisure look. Padukone's outfit was both comfortable and of-the-moment, serving as a lesson in how to bring new polish to travel sweats. 
Padukone grounded her monochromatic look with her signature travel shoes: white Cortez sneakers also by Nike, and completed the ensemble with reflective sunglasses. Keeping her makeup simple and fuss-free, the actor went with nude lips, dewy skin and hair tied back in a sleek ponytail. 
Looking to make a statement while catching a flight or stepping out for a movie with friends? Look no further and take style cues from Padukone's recent travel look. Skip your tired pair of jeans and go with leather pants and an oversized statement sweatshirt. Take your look up a notch via tinted sunglasses and classic white sneakers. Check out the slideshow below for a closer look at Deepika Padukone's travel look.

Do you have a favourite? 
Award season calls for an exciting time on the red carpet and with Oscars 2018 around the corner, it's time to start speculating what we can expect from our favourite celebrities. The Oscars have traditionally lent to some seriously memorable style moments. From Cher's barely-there beaded number to Emma Stone's demurely beaded Givenchy number, the red carpet at the Academy Awards in one to watch for. 
Since the rise of the #MeToo and subsequent Time's Up movements, Hollywood red carpets have been used as platforms for activism. It would be unsurprising if celebrities went with an all-black dress code for the Oscars 2018 just like at the Golden Globes and Grammys this year. What's clear though is that despite the message behind the clothing, celebrities are bound to come forward in their very best for the evening. 
Pantsuits are having a moment in fashion and we hope many of the attendees show up in smart tailoring. Fluffy ballgowns are a thing of the past and have mercifully been replaced by lighter fabrics and sleek cuts. We are eyeing a pop pink gown by Ralph & Russo or Giambattista Valli's caped number for this purpose. For those looking at an alternative take on red carpet dressing can try Givenchy or Versace. Glitter is here to stay as is Gucci's place at award shows and we sure that sparkling dress by the Italian house will find its way to the Oscars. A.F. Vandevorst's version of sari would be the perfect choice for an actor looking to make a mark at the evening.

Easy ethnic 
When it comes to ethnic festive wear, Shilpa Shetty Kundra's wardrobe has vast reserves of inspiration for any event you may have coming up on your social calendar, and her look yesterday was no different. 
After being spotted at the airport in relaxed Anita Dongre Grassroot separates, the actor was seen on the sets of a dance reality show on which she plays host. For the most recent episode, the actor opted for a printed lehenga set by Punit Balana. The floral block print motifs on the lehenga and the choli added a playful touch to her ensemble, and the lack of embellishment made it easy to manoeuvre. Scoring high on both, practicality and sartorial appeal, actor's recent ensemble is perfect if you have a mehandi coming up. 
To accessorise the look, the actor went with oversized silver earrings by Azotiique by Varun Raheja, chunky bangles by Silver House and rings by Curio Cottage. Shetty Kundra topped off her ethnic look with juttis by Fizzy Goblet. Keeping her beauty look sharp and subtle, the actor went with smokey eyes, nude lips, heavy mascara and beachy waves. 
The actor was also spotted shaking a leg with Rani Mukherjee, who opted for a velvet pantsuit by Altuzarra. 
If you're done with the heavy brocades and embellished lehengas but still have events that need ethnic wear, take a leaf out of the actor's style book and pick up a printed lehenga. Add a touch of drama to your look with statement jewellery. Check the slideshow for a closer look at what Shilpa Shetty Kundra wore yesterday.

Karisma Kapoor has had a buzzing February, with multiple social outings in the past few weeks. Whenever she steps out, Karisma Kapoor's easy style never fails to get noticed. Always in breezy dresses, statement-making gowns and ethnic wear, Kapoor makes a case for those who don't want to compromise on style or comfort. 
Over the weekend, we spotted Kapoor with daughter Samiera at UK's teen star, HRVY's (Harvey Leigh Cantwell) concert at the Hard Rock Café Worli, Mumbai. Breaking her recent streak of dresses and lehengas, for the concert, the actor stepped out in wardrobe basics: white T-shirt, mom-fit ripped jeans and a classic black blazer. Kapoor accessorised her look with nothing but a sleek gold watch, and topped it off with classic white sneakers. A cross body black Gucci bag with pearl detailing formed the focus of her look. Keeping her beauty look simple, the actor went with dewy makeup, red lips and blow dried hair.

See our favourite looks from the Oscar nominee's wardrobe here 
Third-time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan is a strong contender for this year's Academy Award for Best Actress. Ronan's performance in Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age film Lady Bird has not only won critical acclaim, but has been applauded by the masses for its familiar yet honest storytelling. 
The 23-year old actor has been in the limelight since 2007. Over her decade-long career, Ronan has starred in films like I Could Never Be Your Woman, The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey, Atonement, Death Defying Acts, City of Ember, The Lovely Bones, Arrietty, The Way Back, Hanna, Violet & Daisy, Byzantium, The Host, How I Live Now, Justin and the Knights of Valour, Lost River, Stockholm, Pennsylvania and Loving Vincent. Her upcoming projects include On Chesil Beach, The Seagull and Mary Queen of Scots. 
Back in 2007, a young Ronan favoured monochrome dresses with minimal trims on the red carpet. As her career progressed, so did her sense of style and her wardrobe featured more dressed with interesting detail. Some of her favourite labels include Gucci, Calvin Klein, Ralph & Russo, Christopher Kane and Burberry. 
Ronan's style has never been more confident than now. From sporting a black lip to a bold one-sleeve number, the Oscar nominee's wardrobe is being watched for more sartorial surprises. Take a look at Saoirse Ronan's style evolution here.

The friend and mother behind the actor 
I knew Sridevi since she was a little kid. She was eight years old when she came to my parent's home in Hyderabad with her mother. At that time, she was working in a movie with ANR (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), [Telugu actor] Nagarjuna's father. I only became good friends with her and her sister as a teenager. I was younger to them and when you are kids, that age gap really matters. Her sister was closer to my age. 
Sri was an amazing actor. My dad (T. Subbarami Reddy) was a co-producer on Chandni. She was so professional about her job. Even now, if you were making a video for fun and put a camera in front of her, her face would just light up. Despite her work commitments, she made room for meetings with her close ones. 
In the last 15 years or so, I have been travelling to Mumbai a lot. She was always quiet and shy as a person but if we were together, she would come out of shell and be a lot more comfortable. Sri never came with an entourage or bodyguards for private events. When I started living in Mumbai, she joined my group of friends and we started travelling together. After Sri came back from New York, she gained more confidence in herself and started interacting even more. 
When my daughter was expecting, she was one of the few people who flew in from Mumbai just for the baby shower. Sri was very caring, if she knew you were unwell, she would pick up the phone to call and see how you were doing. As a mother, she was both protective and progressive. She was always there for you. I am going miss a sister.

A shocking, untimely death 
Veteran actor Sridevi has died at the age of 54 in Dubai of a massive cardiac arrest, reports say. The popular Bollywood actor, who is as well-known for her classics like Chaal Baaz (1989) and Sadma (1983) as her comeback hits, Mom (2017) and English Vinglish (2012), was in the United Arab Emirates for the wedding of nephew Mohit Marwah, with husband Boney Kapoor and family. 
The actor is survived by two daughters, Janhvi Kapoor, who was preparing for a Bollywood debut this year, and Khushi Kapoor. Since the news broke late last night, many industry insiders and personalities have expressed their grief at the untimely loss. Akshay Kumar said in a tweet, "Shocked beyond words to hear about the sad and untimely demise of #Sridevi. A dream for many, had the good fortune of sharing screen space with her long ago and witnessed her continued grace over the years. Thoughts and prayers with the family." 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also conveyed his condolences through Twitter, "Saddened by the untimely demise of noted actor Sridevi. She was a veteran of the film industry, whose long career included diverse roles and memorable performances. My thoughts are with her family and admirers in this hour of grief. May her soul rest in peace." 
  
  
The actor, who was especially known for her comic timing, started out in South Indian cinema before lending her vivacious personality to many Bollywood hits of the '80s and '90s, including Mr India (1987), Chaal Baaz (1989) and Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1993), and some iconic films of all time, including Sadma (1983) and Lamhe (1991). 
Sridevi was last seen celebrating nephew Mohit Marwah's wedding at Ras Al-Khaimah along with daughter Khushi Kapoor, husband Boney Kapoor, and others from the family like Sonam, Anil and Rhea Kapoor. 
Her death comes as a great loss to the industry.

Did you see her blouse? 
Often toeing the line between youthful and soigné, Kareena Kapoor Khan is quite a shape-shifter when it comes to her wardrobe choices. Just days after attending a Navjote celebration, yesterday the actor was spotted at the Mumbai airport, travelling for the Bengaluru International Film Festival. 
For her travel look, the actor opted for a pair of blue jeans, grey T-shirt and an over-sized olive green jacket. Keeping her look travel-appropriate, Kapoor Khan accessorised her outfit with her staple orange Hermès Birkin bag and white sneakers. Kapoor Khan accentuated her simple ensemble with trademark black sunglasses, glossy pink lips and hair tied back in a bun. 
Kapoor Khan has always been a fan of black, and while attending the Bengaluru International Film Festival the actor demonstrated her love for the colour in a classic colour blocked Raw Mango sari. The red and pink border of the sari lent a playful touch to her otherwise severe look. Instead of pairing her sari with a mid riff-baring blouse, Kapoor Khan went with a long, half-sleeved blouse that was perfect for a day event. Keeping her accessories minimal, the actor went nothing but a pair of sleek diamond earrings by Malabar Gold and Diamonds. 
Kapoor Khan maintained understated elegance with her make up and went with her signature beauty look: heavy kohl on the eyes, nude lips, dewy makeup and hair tied in a neat bun. A long blouse can easily be dismissed as a dull option, but the actor showed how it can be dressed up for a lunch meeting. 
Planning to wear a sari for a day event? Take cues from Kapoor Khan's recent ensemble and opt for a classic black number. If cropped, mid riff-baring blouses are not for you, take cues from Kapoor Khan's recent ethnic look and pair your sari with a modest blouse design like the star. Style your look with golden earrings and matching heels. Scroll through our gallery above to take a closer look at Kareena Kapoor Khan's two looks:

Another reason to watch the awards show 
There's a new addition to the list of reasons that make Oscars 2018, the 90th Academy Awards, nothing short of iconic. On March 4, Chilean actress Daniela Vega will become the first openly transgender person to present an award at the Dolby Theatre stage. The 28-year-old is known for her role as an opera singer mourning the death of her boyfriend in Sebastián Lelio's A Fantastic Woman (nominated for Best Foreign film for Oscars 2018). A little trivia on the actress? Vega started her career at the age of eight as an opera singer and made her silver screen debut in The Guest (2014). 
“The fact that I am trans provides the script and narrative with a higher level of truth,” Vega said in an interview with Vanity Fair last month. “But, more importantly, it opens a door into the movie world that had never been explored before, because I am a trans actress playing a trans woman.” 
She won't be the only one set for an iconic moment at this year's Oscars, though. Director Yance Ford, nominated in the Documentary Feature category for Netflix film Strong Island, is also making history as the first openly transgender filmmaker to be nominated for an Academy Award. “If my making history makes it easier for a trans kid at home somewhere to feel more at home in their skin, then I'm so excited about that,” said the filmmaker in an interview with Los Angeles Times. 
Some of the other diverse names seen on the Oscars 2018 list of presenters are Viola Davis, Mahershala Ali, Chadwick Boseman and Gina Rodriguez. The category that Vega will be presenting is still to be announced.

After the success of her much-talked about movie Padmaavat, Deepika Padukone is enjoying her time off. After being spotted at an event last week in a red and white striped Sabyasachi sari, yesterday, the actor was seen at Mumbai airport. Taking a break from designer saris, sharara sets and kurtas, for her recent outing the actor kept things simple in easy separates. 
With her jet-setting lifestyle, over time the actor has become a master of airport dressing. Whether it's comfortable track pants or statement jackets, Padukone has a penchant for stylish travel separates. Case in point: for her recent travel look, the star updated the classic jeans-and-tee combo by pairing a basic grey cropped T-shirt with comfy, white wide-legged jeans. While the high waisted jeans elongated her frame, the midriff baring crop top kept things casual. Jeans may not be the best option to wear on a flight, but Padukone's flared pair looked comfortable enough to make it to a travel look.

The end of an era 
Wendy Rowe, the woman behind all-things-beauty for Burberry, was emotional to say the least, while working backstage at Christopher Bailey's last show for Burberry. After almost 17 years of spearheading the brand, (16 for Rowe), Bailey's last show was an iconic one. Naomi Campbell, Sienna Miller and all the past Burberry girls were in attendance to celebrate the moment. Model Adwoa Aboah was all praise for Rowe, “She brings out your inner beauty, everything you've got, she makes better.” 
In a touching moment, Bailey remarked, “I feel serene but emotional, reflective and very happy in fact, to be surrounded by so many people that I love.” Watch all the behind the scenes action in the video.

Ruling the skies 
In January, we spoke about how Avani Chaturvedi, Bhawana Kanth and Mohana Singh were the first set of Indian women ready to take on solo flights in fighter jets. Earlier this week, one of them, flying officer Avani Chaturvedi, made history by becoming the first Indian woman to fly a fighter aircraft—a MiG-21 Bison—by herself. Chaturvedi undertook the solo sortie on February 19 from the Indian Air Force base in Jamnagar, Gujarat. 
"Chaturvedi became the first Indian woman to fly a fighter aircraft solo when she flew a MiG-21 bison in her first solo flight," an Indian Air Force official confirmed in a statement to PTI. The MiG-21 Bison has the highest landing and take-off speed in the world, clocking in at 340kmph. The flying officer's feat has finally put India in the list of over 20 countries that have women serving in combat positions in their respective air forces, including North Korea, USA, Israel and Germany. 
The Indian government declared in October 2015 its decision to open the fighter pilot positions to women. Soon after, in June 2016, Chaturvedi, along with Bhawana Kanth and Mohana Singh, were commissioned as flying officers. All three have been training since to fly the MiG-21 Bison, and Kanth and Singh will soon follow Chaturvedi with their own solo flights on the fighter jet. 
The IAF has been inducting women in various positions since 1993, however, the fighter stream had been off-limits until recently. Following Chaturvedi's achievement, the IAF is already prepared with the next batch of three women trainee pilots for the fighter stream.

Have you seen the pictures yet? 
Social media was flooded with pictures last night when Justin Trudeau, along with his family, met with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan in Mumbai. It was clearly a major moment for shutterbugs as two of Internet's most-loved men shook hands and posed for the camera. Dressed in a golden sherwani, Trudeau was accompanied by his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, who chose an off-white saree for the occasion. Their kids, Ella-Grace, and Xavier-James were also dressed in traditional Indian attires. Among other Bollywood celebrities present at the meet were Aamir Khan, Anupam Kher, R Madhavan and Farhan Akhtar. 
Posting a picture with Shah Rukh Khan on Twitter, the Canadian prime minister remarked that this meet would hopefully foster stronger ties and new co-production opportunities between the Canadian and Indian film industries. 
It looks like Trudeau is already quite taken with India, if his social media posts are anything to go by. Earlier this week, he visited the Taj Mahal in Agra along with his family, post which they flew to Gujarat. Here, they visited Akshardham and the Sabarmati Ashram, while Trudeau also indulged in a discussion with the students of IIM Ahmedabad. 
The Canadian first family had arrived in India last Saturday for a week-long trip upon invitation by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Through this trip, which also happens to be his first state visit to India, Trudeau hopes to build stronger ties between India and Canada, while also taking time out to enjoy with his family.

It's not only cinema that is celebrated at the Academy Awards. Every year, fashion enthusiasts the world over lie in eager anticipation of the red carpet, where the night's Best Actress nominees will display looks that—should they win—will be forever memorialised in history. From Meryl Streep's gold Christian Leigh number in 1983 to Gwyneth Paltrow's princessy pink Ralph Lauren gown in 1999, revisit the looks every Best Actress winner chose for her big moment. 
When Janet Gaynor collected the inaugural Best Actress statuette in 1929 wearing a simple midi skirt, long-sleeved sweater and foulard, no one could have foreseen the importance that the Best Actress outfit was to acquire over the next nine decades. Today, actresses—now with the help of professional stylists, many of them celebrities in their own right—outdo themselves to shine on the red carpet, and the world's top fashion designers are only too eager to help them out. 
Looking back through the years, it's clear that some looks have aged better than others. There is nothing that screams ‘80s excess more than Cher's bejeweled nude dress with matching velvet shawl Bob Mackie designed for her in 1988. Others, like Halle Berry, have made more classic choices—the sheer-fronted Elie Saab burgundy gown she wore in 2002 looks every bit as good today as it did 16 years ago. 
On March 4, Sally Hawkins, Frances McDormand, Margot Robbie, Saoirse Ronan and Meryl Streep will accept this year's Best Actress wearing a dress—or could it be a suit?—that will have its place in history. While we wait for the big reveal, click through all the Best Actress looks from 1929 to today.

Priyanka Chopra was seen in a behind-the-scenes peek shared by the Academy Awards' official Instagram page, while they were filming their nominations video. Last year, the nominations were announced at the event in the form of a sketch featuring various actors, and this years seems to be following suit. Since she's in the video, it's likely that the star will be attending the awards show, too. 
Last Oscars, Ruth Negga arrived in a stunning red Valentino princess gown, while Naomie Harris debuted Raf Simon's Calvin Klein. Meanwhile, Sofia Boutella showed up in Chanel Haute Couture, Karlie Kloss wore a stunning white Stella McCartney dress, and Dakota Johnson showed up in Gucci. The Oscars red carpet usually serves up a smorgasbord of inspiration, not just with ensembles, but also with stand-out beauty looks. Stay tuned to see what the stars will wear this year.

From the happy couple's outfits to the star-studded guest list 
This year's line-up of big Bollywood weddings started yesterday, as Mohit Marwah, son of Sandeep Marwah, owner of Noida's Film City, gets set to tie the knot with fiancé Antara Motiwala at the Waldorf Astoria, Ras Al Khaimah. Marwah is Anil Kapoor's nephew, which means the Kapoor family was in full attendance at the event. 
The celebrations kicked off with a a colourful mehandi ceremony during the day, which was followed by a star-studded cocktail party. The bride opted for a range of Manish Malhotra ensembles, picking a pastel chikankari lehenga bursting with blooms for her mehendi and a shimmery lehenga for her cocktail party.

With the wedding season in full swing, yesterday we spotted Sridevi with daughter Khushi Kapoor and husband Boney Kapoor at Mumbai airport, travelling to Al Ras Khaimah for Mohit Marwah's grand wedding with Antara Motiwala. In case you missed the updates on Instagram, #antumoh has taken over everyone's Instagram feed. Sridevi, along with the entire Kapoor family, was spotted enjoying the wedding celebrations. 
Sridevi kick-started the wedding celebrations in an ivory kurta and skirt set from her favourite designer and close friend Manish Malhotra's most recent collection. While the full-sleeved kurta featured minimal floral embroidery complementing the heavy lehenga skirt, the gota work on the skirt and the dupatta elevated the subtle colour scheme of her ensemble. When it came to accessories, the actor anchored her look with white floral earrings and a matching potli bag. Sridevi kept her her makeup and hair simple with heavily kohl-lined eyes, nude lips, dewy base and braided hair. Khushi Kapoor was spotted in a floral Manish Malhotra lehenga too, taking pictures with her mother and the designer. 
For her second look for the day, Sridevi stuck to the nude colour palette but switched it up with a sleeker Faraz Manan ensemble. The actor accessorised her high-shine outfit with nothing but a diamond ring and emerald and diamond earrings. To keep the focus on her outfit, the actor went with glossy lips, shimmery eyeshadow and hair tied back in a ponytail.

And the other highlights you need to catch up on 
Ever since the Women's March in the beginning of 2017, the cause of women's empowerment has been steadily gaining steam. Fighting for equal rights, and against gender discrimination, sexual and other forms of assault, have become the order of the day, in a movement that, thanks to social media, now spans countries and continents. 
In our weekly newsletter every Monday, we aim to bring to you the latest updates from the front line—everything, big or small, that will help spark meaningful conversations in the move towards equality. Below, the updates from last week. 
  
  
BAFTA 2018 saw a reprisal of the all-black dress code of the Golden Globes, in order to support the Time's Up campaign. While a number of celebrities turned up in ebony, the Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton) attended in a deep green Jenny Packham gown. According to royal protocol, family members cannot make political statements, but Middleton's black sash could be a tiny, if not certain, nod to the #TimesUp movement. 
At this year's Berlin Film Festival, German actor Anna Brüggemann urged women attending to not feel pressurised to dress up in the red carpet uniform of low-cut gowns and high heels, opting for whatever they feel is more comfortable instead. Using the hashtag #NobodysDoll, the actor wishes to call out the compulsion women attending these events feel to adhere to the unspoken dress code. “Women are expected to squeeze into tight-fitting, low-cut dresses and totter on impossible heels in order to serve the gaze of those who'll judge whether they are marketable or not," she said in an interview. 
An extensive new report by the Boston Globe has brought more cases of sexual misconduct in the fashion industry to light. Veteran fashion photographers Patrick Demarchelier and Greg Kadel, and leading stylist Karl Templer are among the names that have been identified by over 50 models who spoke to the publication.

A new era of empowerment 
“Tonight's red carpet was London's way of joining forces with the women at the Golden Globes,” celebrity stylist Cristina Ehrlich tells Vogue. “Women coming together and making the decision to still dress up, but to have their moment in black, and continue to empower women everywhere.” 
Ehrlich has been dressing Greta Gerwig for her Lady Bird press trail for months, but for the BAFTAs 2018, she's also behind the looks of Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Andrea Riseborough, who walked into the awards ceremony with Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, the trade unionist and co-founder of UK Black Pride, in homage to the #TimesUp movement and the new UK Justice And Equality Fund, which herself and Mbatha-Raw signed. 
Black, Ehrlich says, has not been a restrictive brief, rather a fun, creative one. “It becomes a different type of challenge. You have to find a black dress that's the right black dress. I wanted my ladies to choose the dress as though there wasn't a precursor that everyone would wear black, and choose it as though it was the best dress for them.” 
“I have been doing red-carpet dressing now for 20 years and it has been a very unexpected moment to feel inspired,” she continues. “To help influence making such a strong statement, a statement that suggests the beginning of an era is empowering.” 
For Ehrlich it could have been any colour, it's continuing the #TimesUp message that is important. “Black is just the symbol of women as one union saying that from now on they will wear what they want to wear, not what they think they should be wearing,” she clarifies. 
For skeptics pondering whether a dress code can be anything more than an (empty) gesture, Ehrlich, says, “It's not just a statement for women in the entertainment industry. As the activists [taken as guests of Emma Watson, Michelle Williams et al] at the Golden Globes showed, it's for women everywhere. We all acknowledge that the time is up, and it's a new landscape of freedom, safety, protection and community.” Her sentiment chimes with the open letter signed by 190 British and Irish actors published in the Observer the morning of the BAFTAs, which urged everyone "to spread the word to others and be a catalyst for change." 
Though Ehrlich's career has been built on the successful red-carpet reviews of her clients, she says, “It would be a shame for people to lean back and and think about the more superficial attitude of why they chose what to wear what they wore to the BAFTAs. Instead people need to know that Greta, Gugu, Andrea and all the other women on the red carpet chose to wear black dresses that made them feel beautiful, and that helped them feel confident to be a part of the message.” 
What better sentiment to carry forward on the final push of the 2018 awards season: the Oscars. Whether it's business as usual on the red carpet—Ehrlich predicts this will be the case—or a sea of black, the message, by this point, has been made loud and clear.

Maximum impact with minimum effort 
Kareena Kapoor Khan's social calendar has been buzzing this past week. Just days after celebrating her father Randhir Kapoor's 71st birthday in an ebony halter and matching trousers, the actor was spotted attending a Navjote celebration in Mumbai. When she's not making a statement with athleisure (sometimes literally), Kapoor Khan is acing ethnic wear. In an example of the latter, Kapoor Khan opted for a mint-hued anarkali set by Simar Dugal for the Navjote. 
The look featured sheer sleeves and a matching dupatta with a thick gota border. Given the subdued colour palette of her ensemble, the golden accents on the anarkali and the dupatta added drama to her evening look. 
The actor kept things simple with the accessories—a pair of multi-layered chandbali earrings and a ring by Khurana Jewellery House was all her look was paired with. For makeup, Kapoor went with smoky eyes, nude lips, dewy makeup and hair tied back in a neat ponytail. 
Also during the weekend, the actor was spotted on a day out with son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. Going back to her casual uniform, she paired a striped T-shirt with flared jeans and sequinned sneakers.

Kareena Kapoor Khan and sister Karisma Kapoor never fail to make their parents feel special on their birthdays. Last year, the Kapoor sisters lit up dad Randhir Kapoor's 70th birthday with a huge celebration (remember their festive twinning moment in Manish Malhotra kurtas?), and for mom Babita Kapoor's 70th, the duo came together for a celebratory lunch last year at Hakkasan. This year, the sisters got another chance to party with their parents last night. The occasion: Randhir Kapoor's 71st birthday. 
Held at Bandra's China Garden restaurant, Randhir Kapoor's birthday get-together was also attended by Rishi and Neetu Kapoor, Rima and Manoj Jain, Armaan Jain and Rajiv Kapoor. Karisma Kapoor's kids Samaira and Kiaan Raj Kapur were also present. While Karisma Kapoor picked a vibrant tangerine and red Bibhu Mohapatra maxi for the occasion, Kareena Kapoor Khan twinned with Babita Kapoor in black and white separates. 
The highlight of Randhir Kapoor's birthday celebration had to be the decadent chocolate cake dedicated to him from grandchildren Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, Samaira Kapur and Kiaan Raj Kapur. Served on a bed of rose petals and loaded with Oreos, chocolate sticks, Kit-Kats and Malteasers, the cake featured little flags bearing each grandkid's name, along with a sign reading "Happy birthday nana, we love you". One of the sweetest pictures from the evening was the one of Babita Kapoor feeding Randhir Kapoor a piece of his cake. 
Prior to Randhir Kapoor's dinner party, Karisma Kapoor kick-started her dad's birthday celebrations earlier in the day by sharing a family portrait on her Instagram page. Captioned “Happy birthday papa #WeLoveYou #BirthdayWishes #OurPapa #FamilyLove,” the picture seems to have been shot during the Kapoors' trip to Pataudi last December, where they brought in Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi's first birthday.

The couple part ways after two years of marriage 
Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have announced they are separating after two and a half year of marriage. 
The couple have said their split was “mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year,” according to a joint statement via Aniston's publicist Stephen Huvaneto the Associated Press. 
“Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” the statement said. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.” 
The pair said they are hoping to remain friends. “We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.” 
Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, were together for a total of seven years, having exchanged vows in 2015. 
Hearts are definitely breaking today.

Take a peek inside 
Each year, Valentine's Day gives romantics around the globe a chance to show their loved ones how special they are. And for singles, the annual occasion is a great excuse for parties with friends. One Bollywood favourite who loves celebrating the single life on Valentine's Day: director Karan Johar. 
Just like the past few years, Karan Johar invited his favourite single people over for a party at his Bandra residence last evening, and just like his other soirees, this one was a night to remember. Among his guests for the evening were designers Manish Malhotra and Vikram Phadnis, along with Bollywood stars Athiya Shetty, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapur, Nimrat Kaur, Vaani Kapoor, Neha Dhupia, Sophie Choudry, Bhumi Pednekar, Sooraj Pancholi, Dino Morea, Farhan Akhtar, Kiara Advani, and Kim Sharma. Joining them were Sussanne Khan, Ujjwala Raut, and siblings Tusshar and Ekta Kapoor. While Athiya Shetty spent her night taking pictures of Sonakshi Sinha in that slinky black dress, Sophie Choudry loaded up her Instagram feed with celebratory selfies. 
While most celebrate Valentine's Day with cheesy, loved-up decor, Johar had his terrace decorated with tongue-in-cheek anti-Valentine's Day slogans. While one banner read “love disappoints, pizza is eternal”, another hilarious phrase spotted at his home was “love is in the air, do not breathe.” It comes as no surprise that Karan Johar's guests couldn't resist sharing the quirky decorations on their social media pages. Check out all the pictures from the party now.

Jumpsuits, pantsuits and unpredictable saris 
Aditi Rao Hydari has had a busy week. Just days after stepping out in a canary yellow mehendi-ready anarkali, the star made another public appearance last afternoon for her upcoming film, Daas Dev. For the trailer launch of the movie, Aditi Rao Hydari opted for a checkered Zara jumpsuit (priced at Rs 3,990), worn over a crisp white shirt. Her beauty look, as always, featured sleek, straight hair, perfectly sculpted brows and flawless, glowing skin. 
Another star who kept busy with film promotions yesterday was Twinkle Khanna. Over the past few weeks, we've seen Mrs Funnybones talk about Pad Man in several sharp blazers, and yesterday, she continued her power dressing streak in an ashy blue pantsuit. What made Twinkle Khanna's look memorable: the unpredictable maroon star print shirt she wore under her suit. 
For Swara Bhaskar, Indian ethnic wear was the pick of the day yesterday. While most stars have been wearing the staple with party-ready embellished blouses, Bhaskar wore her black and white version with a slouchy shirt-style blouse, and completed her look with black loafers. 
Over in New York, Michael Kors' fall 2018 collection was all anyone could talk about. There to check out the designers' latest line were Zendaya and Blake Lively, both dressed in vibrant red Michael Kors creations. While Zendaya opted for a scarlet tracksuit, Blake Lively walked into the show wearing a crimson crackle patent leather princess coat. Pick your favourite look out of our slideshow.

How far would you go? 
It all began when I was a teen. My father brought home one of those boxy '90s computers that took up half of my bedroom and looked like a giant and misunderstood musical instrument from the future. But once it was connected to the "internet" with a peculiar and long-drawn-out electronic crackle—my life changed. 
Within a few months, I was a regular at all the usual suspects—Yahoo! Chat, MSN Messenger and even a Rediff something. These chat rooms let me change my identity, and with just an initial exchange of ASL (Age, Sex, Location: in case you skipped growing up in the '90s completely), I'd be off! In a time before cyber security became a real concern for parents, for a teen who wasn't otherwise allowed to go to a coffee shop without a chaperone, the world of the interweb made my head dizzy with possibilities—albeit, virtual ones. 
What followed were years of blurry conversations in myriad chatrooms with bizarre (and mostly fake) identities across the world. Over time, some were befriended and emailed separately while others, left in the dust. In the midst of all this, I developed a crush or two. I can still remember the heady rush from getting an email after a long day at school and the thrill of chatting with a stranger who somehow believed I was 17 and living in London. 
Over the years we forgot. We let the naïveté of our times slide by and allowed ourselves to grow up. We made real friends and forged actual, real-life intimacies. Some of us skittered from one relationship to the next, while others remained more discreet, silently wishing for a miracle. 
So when dating apps finally made their way into our culture, we already knew what to do. It was like a backdoor into our childhoods, a shortcut to finding someone to match the templates we'd formed in our minds, a second chance. And boy did we all dive in. Here's my story and of others like me, who found their love in the online world. 
  
When I finally decided to find someone online, the Russian roulette of dating—Tinder—became my weapon of choice. Using my smartphone to glide over countless profiles before swiping right to acknowledge my interest in one of them—I was temporarily hooked. It was a cheap distraction from the drudgery of everyday existence. I could hold my existential angst at bay, leave my worries of never really finding "The One" aside and swipe away. It was simple and liberating and—lasted only a few days. Soon, the shallowness of the conversations, crudeness of the pick-up lines and a culture of excess left a bitter aftertaste, and I deleted my profile in disgust. A few months later, on a rainy Saturday afternoon, I re-installed the app on a whim only to find my profile still there. And off I went again. Swipe, Delete, Rinse, Repeat. 
It was a vicious circle and somewhere in all this, I met a guy who grew on me. The first time we met, we talked about North Korea and arranged marriages with a generous sprinkling of Scientology, over beer. On a quiet terrace of an old hotel with the backdrop of the Bandra sky—we became friends. 
Two years later, we still go to this terrace to grab a beer or two. And neither of us really misses the swiping. - Ankita, 30 
  
"I was studying in London and being alone in a new city had emboldened me in a lot of ways. So, meeting new people was definitely on the agenda. Followed by a couple of nightmarish experiences on Tinder, I finally swore off the dating app. Enter, Bumble. The app where the girl starts the conversation with matches. Sounded like a utopian scenario and I gave it a go. A fantastic two-hour long conversation about—lo and behold—our shared hate and fatigue over dating apps, I was left hanging mid-conversation by this guy. Friends, maybe, I thought. 
"Two weeks later, my best friend came to visit and nagged me (as best friends do) about how I was "not taking enough risks" and needed to "get out there" and "Is there no one you like?" My mind traced back to one memorable banter. I picked it up where we'd left off and a week later, we had a "not-a-date" date all fixed up. And here we are now—a transatlantic couple in a relationship for two years, set apart by a meagre five-and-a-half-hour time difference and 6,000 miles (but thank you, Bumble). - Akanksha, 27 
  
"I looked in bars, in bookstores, in cafes, on flights, in dimly-lit gigs—my chance encounter with the perfect stranger was not to happen. The most millennial thing I have done to my name till date has been downloading a dating app. If you have ever reached that point in your life when you start looking for dates on Tinder, you feel concerned for yourself and then mortified when you find a match. 
Going on a date with someone you met online is no worse than being set up on a blind date. It needs courage and a tough hide, and sometimes, an exit strategy. As for the product in question, it's like buying a dress online—sometimes it fits, other times the whole exercise is in vain. To borrow from Baz Luhrmann, "Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's." 
I have only been on two Tinder dates in my life. The first one was such a disaster, I called a friend to fake an emergency. The second one started at Starbucks and ended at a house party thrown in the honour of a dear friend and colleague's farewell. My date not only politely answered questions concerning the details of how we met, but played drinking games with a roomful of people he had never met (but I worked with), and stayed back to take out the trash until almost everyone else had left. I was told he was a keeper. The next morning, I asked him to get off the app and he obliged. We are currently working on a plan to explain how all of this transpired to our families, when the time comes, since, you know, a dating app doesn't make for the most parent-friendly love story." - Rujuta, 27 
  
"My husband and I matched on Tinder in Bangalore. I was only there for a few days of work, so we didn't get to meet until six months later when I was back in Bangalore for work. During the six months between us matching and meeting, we stayed in touch and developed a friendship to the extent of even discussing each other's dates on Tinder. It was unusual for me to continue to confide in somebody I hadn't even met, but Louis was a very attentive listener, had a funny bone and dimples, ticking off all the boxes in my book. When I returned to Bangalore, I was there for a longer time and we ended up spending all those days together. At the end of my trip, we knew this was more than just a "Tinder encounter" and decided to give it a real shot. We did 10 months of long distance (Delhi-Bangalore) and visited each other every two weeks before I moved to Bangalore. We lived in Bangalore for a year before we moved to Montreal, which is where he's actually from. We got married this month in an intimate setting with our friends and family. I hope everybody finds the kind of love I have found... on Tinder." - Aarya, 27 
  
"My wife and I primarily got introduced through mutual friends on Facebook, but crazy enough, our profiles were put up on a popular matrimonial site by our respective friends and family. Personally, for me, it was really hilarious to even think that I would ever put up my matrimonial credentials on an online wedding website, but Anu never seemed not be bothered by it. What I loved about her profile was that she was brutally honest of what she had to say. No flowery self-obsessed tone there. Excerpt: 'I am a novice at this online dating craze, but still giving it a shot, hoping to find someone honest with no bullshit attached to it.' Soon enough, we decided to go offline and started talking in real time (really long phone calls, Facetime, Skype and Whatsapp). 
"We both were slightly nervous on our first date. I prepared my favourite ham and cheese sandwiches (which she was quite surprisingly fond of) for dinner paired with a lovely bottle of Chilean red. We settled ourselves next to the balcony window and the laughter and conversations never stopped till we realised it was almost 3am in the morning. It was one of the best late nights, and we could call it a successful date. There was a hurdle though; we lived in different cities, which made us thoughtful about starting the long-distance relationship. But soon enough we overcame that as she decided to move to Mumbai with her job. Both of our families gave us immense support, which made our bonding even stronger and soon enough materialised into a potential marriage plan. 
"My advice would be to look in the obvious places, but with your heart and mind open, and never underestimate your gut." - Anjan, 38

Have you seen it yet? 
Over the past few months, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's name has been linked to several exciting new projects. Back in May 2017, the star's fans first heard about her joining husband Abhishek Bachchan in Anurag Kashyap's Gulab Jamun. Then came the sneak peek of Jasmine: Story of a Leased Womb, where Rai Bachchan is rumoured to be playing a surrogate mom. And if all that wasn't enough to keep movie buffs on their toes, the first look of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's character in Fanne Khan has just hit the internet too. 
Layering a black camisole, ebony shirt and studded camouflage jacket, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's sneak peek from Fanne Khan shows the actor in an all-new, grunge-meets-glam avatar. While Aishwarya Rai Bachchan usually prefers poker straight hair and scarlet lips when she's not shooting, her look for Fanne Khan has her working voluminous red curls, nude lips and reflective sunnies. KriArj Entertainment's caption for the brand new picture also hints at the personality of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's character in the film, saying “There are divas and then there is #AishwaryaRaiBachchan… our shining star!” 
The latest on Fanne Khan is that the movie is a remake of Dutch film Everybody's Famous!, which tracks the life of a teenage songstress whose father kidnaps the number one singer in her country. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who will be seen sharing screen space with Anil Kapoor in the movie, will play the role of a struggling musician who also happens to be a huge fan of Lata Mangeshkar. Rumour has it Fanne Khan will also show Rai Bachchan paying tribute to the iconic playback singer. Can't wait to know more? Here's another picture from the sets of the movie.

If there's one activity you won't find Kareena Kapoor Khan missing out on, it's her workout. Whether she is attending social events, spending time with baby Taimur or fulfilling her work commitments, actor's life schedule doesn't stop her from hitting the gym. 
Kapoor Khan is a frequent advocate of relaxed separates. Case in point, yesterday, the actor was spotted outside her gym in Bandra sporting a well-thought-out look. For her workout session, the actor kept things easy and opted for a basic white tank top and black track pants. The white H&M tank top reading ‘Aloha Sunday' (aloha is hello in Hawaiian) was a perfect cover-up over her active wear separates and gave us a peek into Kareena Kapoor Khan's mid-week state of mind (we feel you!). The sides of her black track pants featured bold shimmery stripes, adding drama to the otherwise low-key look. Keeping things gym appropriate, the actor chose black sneakers and completed the ensemble with brightly-coloured reflective aviators. Given that this was right after her workout, she wore her hair back in a bun with no makeup, just sporting a dewy, natural glow.

Plus, Gigi Hadid's clap back at body shamers 
Ever since the Women's March in the beginning of 2017, the cause of women's empowerment has been steadily gaining steam. Fighting for equal rights, and against gender discrimination, sexual and other forms of assault, have become the order of the day, in a movement that, thanks to social media, now spans countries and continents. 
In our weekly newsletter, we aim to bring to you the latest updates from the front line—everything, big or small, that will help spark meaningful conversations in the move towards equality. Below, the updates from last week.

Did you see the sequinned pants? 
After her much talked-about wedding, Anushka Sharma was away from the social circuit for a while, enjoying time off with cricketer husband Virat Kohli. But with her upcoming Bollywood feature Pari releasing next month, the actor is back in action. After being spotted at Mumbai airport in a comfortable Chola ensemble, yesterday, the actor kick-started the promotional rounds for her movie in head-turning separates by Nikhil Thampi. While her wardrobe usually prioritises ease of wear, for her recent look, the actor switched it up in a backless top and pants from the designer's latest collection. The full-sleeved top featured a long front, but the risqué, surprise back made it perfect for a date night look. For drama, Sharma paired the backless top with high-shine sequinned pants.

With the top and pants in focus, the actor kept it simple and chose not to sport any accessories. To keep her makeup in sync with her all-black look, Sharma wore smoky eyes, nude lips, heavy mascara and her hair tied back in a sleek ponytail. 
A post shared by Nikhil Thampi (@nikhilthampi) on Feb 11, 2018 at 11:13pm PST 
If you were wondering what the outfit looks like, Nikhil Thampi shared a fun Boomerang on his Instagram account with a model twirling in the same outfit. 
If you really want to stand out at your next party, take inspiration from Anushka Sharma's separates and swap your basic LBD in favour of a backless top or a dress. Pair your daring number with a pair of all-eyes-on-me sequinned pants. Those looking for a scene-stealing entry can also go all out in sequin-on-sequin separates by Halpern. Take a closer look at Anushka Sharma's outfit in the slideshow above.

Wardrobe goals 
Sridevi is not one to shy away from making a sartorial statement, whether it's acing athleisure with her travel looks or stepping out in knockout Indian ethnic wear at weddings. After twinning with her daughter Janhvi Kapoor in Anamika Khanna ensembles at the grand finale for Lakmé Fashion Week this season, the actor was spotted attending her close friend Tina Ambani's 54th birthday party in a dramatic look. 
While the actor is known to favour metallics and neutrals, this time, she opted for a bold red off-shoulder jumpsuit by Falguni Shane Peacock, which featured a flared top and pants, with minimal sequin detailing making it perfect for evenings. The actor added contrast to her all-red look with black strappy heels.

Have a closer look 
Sonam Kapoor has had a busy month while promoting upcoming film Pad Man, with her co-actors including Akshay Kumar and Radhika Apte. From classic saris to comfortable dresses, Kapoor made sure to step out in headline-making outfits for each occasion. Yesterday, the star was spotted at the popular Gauri Khan Designs store in Juhu, Mumbai. 
Ever since the launch of the lifestyle store, the space has had A-listers dropping by to show their support just like Kapoor. The actor chose a coordinated sweatshirt and skirt set that set new rules for off-duty dressing. Making a case for comfort, the sweatshirt was intentionally slouchy and bore a vintage TV print—the perfect outfit to set the tone for your Netflix binge-watch this weekend. 
Adding a pop of colour to her printed ensemble, the actor chose red lips, with smoky eyes and hair tied back in a sleek ponytail for balance. The actor chose to keep it simple with nothing but white Nike sneakers.

From lifelong marriages to whirlwind romances 
Whether on or off the screen, the romances of Hollywood's Golden Age stars have maintained a starring role in popular culture, providing endless reference material for consolidated couples and aspiring lovebirds alike. 
There is the simple enjoyment of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard sharing drinks and food in 1938, a year before getting married in Arizona; the explosive laughs of Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer on a country road outside Paris in 1956; and the delicate kiss between Elizabeth Taylor and her fifth husband, Richard Burton, on the day of their first wedding in 1964. Whether the product of long-lasting marriages, short romances or dramatic liaisons, these vintage images are testament to love's best moments.

Catch up on all the action now 
February 7 marked a big moment for Karan Johar. The Bollywood director's baby twins, Roohi Johar and Yash Johar, turned one yesterday. To mark the occasion, Johar held a birthday celebration for his kids at his Bandra residence last evening. “It's a small birthday party at home, with just kids their age,” Karan Johar had said to DNA prior to the party. “I want to keep it simple and intimate this year.” All multicoloured balloons and fairy lights, this one was an evening to remember. 
Despite the get-together being simpler than the blowouts Karan Johar usually hosts, Roohi and Yash Johar's birthday was studded with stars. There to party with the kids were Manish Malhotra, Sonakshi Sinha, Kaajal Anand, Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Rani Mukerji and Student Of The Year co-stars Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra. Given the occasion, Alia Bhatt picked a baby pink Nakita Singh dress for the party, while Sidharth Malhotra twinned with Kaajal Anand and Shweta Bachchan Nanda in white sweatshirts saying ‘Roohi & Yash', made specifically for the party. But none could compete with the twins' dad. Karan Johar partied with his kids in a hot pink Gucci sweatshirt embroidered with a golden brown teddy bear. 
Along with Karan Johar's closest crew, Yash and Roohi Johar's toddler friends made sure to be part of their big day as well. Kareena Kapoor Khan (wearing a quirky sequinned T-shirt) was spotted driving into the Johar residence with a beaming Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi sitting on her lap, and Shah Rukh Khan accompanied son AbRam Khan to the celebration too. Rumour has it that Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor's daughter Misha Kapoor and Tusshar Kapoor's son Laksshya Kapoor were also on the Johars' guest list. 
They may not be on social media themselves, but Roohi and Yash Johar received lots of birthday love via Instagram yesterday. While Alia Bhatt shared a picture of the duo captioned “May you live to be a 103! Happy birthday my beautiful siblings”, designer Manish Malhotra wished the kids saying “Happy birthday my dearest nephew Yash and niece Roohi lots and lots of love” and Sonakshi Sinha posted an Instagram story of herself showering Yash Johar with birthday kisses. Just like dad Karan Johar said, “I introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name. ‘This is your Chacha and this is your Bua!' I give them all a family tag. I want my babies to know that their family is large.” Check out all the highlights from the birthday in our slideshow:

Have you seen it yet? 
From channelling demi-denim trend to stepping out in relaxed separates, Priyanka Chopra's closet knows no dearth of statement pieces. The star has been busy shooting for the third season of Quantico in New York and has been stepping out in envy-worthy looks. 
After braving the New York chill in a gold Balenciaga jacket, yesterday Priyanka Chopra was spotted taking a stroll in New York. For her casual outing the star styled a cosy leopard-print fluffy coat by Alice + Olivia with ripped denims. The long coat was a great alternative to classic black winter coats.

Keeping her beauty look casual and city appropriate, the actor went with dewy makeup, nude lips and hair tied up in a messy bun to complement her look. Given the busy nature of her jacket, Chopra offset her look with nothing but black tinted sunglasses and white boots by Tretorn, that were polished enough for a casual city-outing. 
In the recent past, the actor has also been spotted wearing a Zadig & Voltaire jumper, a slouchy grey Jason Wu ensemble and long black coats. If you're planning a small weekend getaway to a colder destination and keeping cosy is on top of your priority list, take cues from Priyanka Chopra's separates and throw a statement printed coat over your jeans-and-tee outfit.

Everything you wanted to know about the Games that begin on February 9 
While the opening ceremony is on February 9, the competition begins the day before. The Games will conclude on February 25. 
In 2011, PyeongChang in South Korea was declared the successful bidder for the 2018 Winter Olympics. The sleepy skiing destination thwarted bids from Munich, Germany; and Annecy, France. PyeongChang is located about 125km from South Korea's capital Seoul, and about 100km from the Demilitarised Zone separating the country from North Korea. 
The Pyeongchang Olympic Village will house up to 3,894 athletes and team officials, while a second village in Gangneung will accommodate around 2,900 personnel. 
India will have two representatives at the 2018 Games. Shiva Keshavan will be competing at his sixth and final Olympics in the Luge competition. Jagdish Singh is our second representative and will participate in the 15km freestyle skiing event. This is his first time at the Winter Games. 
[#image: /photos/5ce422737a66d2e1e6e760ff]||| ||| Shiva Keshavan. Image: Getty 
India competed at the Winter Olympic Games for the first time at 1964 in Innsbruck, Austria. The sole athlete representing India was Jeremy Bujakowski, who competed in the Men's Downhill event in Alpine Skiing. Next up was Grenoble, France, in 1968. India ended up missing all of the Winter Games until 1988 and then again missed the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, and then came back in 1998 in Nagano, Japan. We have never missed a single Winter Olympics since then. In the 2014 Sochi games, India had three representatives—Shiva Keshavan, Himanshu Thakur in alpine skiing and Nadeem Iqbal in cross-country skiing. India is still to win its first medal from any of the Winter Olympics events. 
Unfortunately, there is no live TV broadcast for Indian audiences. You can follow the latest scores and happenings on the Games' Twitter and Facebook accounts. 
PyeongChang is three and a half hours ahead of India. 
The Games will feature 102 events across 15 sport disciplines, making it the first Winter Games to surpass 100 medal events. The events you can follow are Alpine Skiing, Bobsleigh, Cross-Country Skiing, Ski Jumping, Biathlon, Curling, Figure Skating, Ice Hockey, Luge, Freestyle Skiing, Short Track Speed, Skeleton, Speed Skating and Snowboard. Big Air Snowboarding, Mixed Team Alpine Skiing, Mass Start Speed Skating and Mixed Doubles Curling make their debut from this Olympics. The Parallel Slalom Snowboarding events, in which two snowboarders raced head-to-head, were dropped. 
[#image: /photos/5ce42273b40d266cb8d6be19]||| ||| Image: Getty 
The mascot, and hence the most commonly available cuddly toy there, is Soohorang, a white tiger. White tigers have been long considered a guardian in Korean history and culture. ‘Sooho', which means ‘protection' in Korean, symbolises the protection offered to the athletes, spectators and other participants of the Games. ‘Rang' comes from the middle letter of ‘Ho-rang-i', the Korean word for tiger. It is also the last letter of Jeong-seon A-ri-rang, a traditional folk song of Gangwon province, which governs PyeongChang. The mascot for the Paralympics, which begin after the Winter Games, is Bandabi, a black bear. 
The medals feature a design of diagonal lines and 3D characters from Hangeul, the Korean alphabet. They have been inspired by the texture of tree trunks. The teal and red ribbon from which the medal hangs was made using gapsa, a traditional South Korean fabric. It is embroidered with Hangeul patterns and other local designs. 
[#image: /photos/5ce422741dc2670651c77e50]||| ||| Image: Getty 
Breaking the tradition of overspending at each successive Olympics, the estimated cost of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics is $10 billion. That is five times less than the 2014 Sochi Olympics—estimated to be the costliest ever. 
For the first time ever, North and South Korea have come together to form one team at an Olympics event. A joint women's hockey team will compete as ‘Korea'. The two warring Koreas will also march together under one flag at the opening ceremony on February 9. 
To avoid confusion with North Korea's capital Pyongyang, the organisers changed the name of the city by capitalising the ‘C'. So it is PyeongChang and not Pyeongchang. But this is just for the Games, so only till February 25. 
This is not the first time that PyeongChang has bid for the Winter Olympics. It lost to Vancouver, Canada, in 2010 by three votes and to Sochi, Russia, in 2014 by four votes. They won thanks to the development of high-speed rail lines this year. The city, which was earlier isolated, is now connected to Seoul by train with travel time of less than 60 minutes.

In our weekly newsletter, we aim to bring to you the latest updates from the front line—everything, big or small, that will help spark meaningful conversations in the move towards equality. Below, the updates from last week. 
At a talk show to promote her book Brave, Rose McGowan, one of the frontrunners of the #MeToo movement, hinted at another prominent Hollywood "predator". When asked by host Ronan Farrow if she was ready to reveal who it was, she said, "In general? Sure. Right now at this moment? I've had a big day." 
Former US Olympic gymnastics team doctor, Larry Nassar, was sentenced to 40 to 125 years of prison for molesting young gymnasts. More than 260 girls and women have accused Nassar of abuse since the 1990s. 
Promotions for Bollywood movie Pad Man are in full swing, and are taking down the stigma of pads and periods in their wake. In a viral Instagram campaign to promote the movie (releasing February 9), celebrities and prominent personalities have been posting pictures of themselves holding a sanitary napkin with the caption, "Yes, that's a pad in my hand & there's nothing to be ashamed about. It's natural! Period" (sic).

Jenner finally puts rest to the speculations 
Kylie Jenner has announced the name of her baby daughter as Stormi, revealed via a post on Instagram. Writing the caption ‘Stormi' alongside a photo of Jenner and her daughter holding hands (so cute!), the 20-year-old mum has finally put to rest any rumours or speculation. 
stormi webster 👼🏽 
A post shared by  Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Feb 6, 2018 at 1:14pm PST 
Fans originally thought the name would be related to butterflies, thanks to a number of connections the youngest Jenner has with the creatures—and more recently, fans thought the name would start with a 'C' thanks to a flower arrangement in the shape of the letter sent to Jenner by her sister Khloé Kardashian. 
Jenner gave birth to Stormi on February 1, announcing the news via an 11-minute video posted to Youtube, which detailed the journey from pregnancy test to birth. 
Writing on Instagram, Jenner said she wanted to keep the pregnancy a secret due to the impact coming public might have on her mental wellbeing, and the wellbeing of her daughter. 
“I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions. I understand you're used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world. I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how. There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness," she wrote. 
♥️ 
A post shared by  Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Feb 4, 2018 at 12:27pm PST 
The Kardashian Jenner family reacted to the news the day of the announcement, posting their happiness at their youngest sister's first child and finally coming clean that yep, they too were in on the secret the whole time. 
Even Caitlyn Jenner had something to say, surprising fans as she was noticeably absent from the announcement video posted by Jenner. 
Welcome to the world, Stormi.

This one's going to be unmissable 
"I am ecstatic to share with you all the two most wonderful additions to my life, my children and life lines; Roohi and Yash," Karan Johar had announced on social media the day he brought his twins home in 2017. It's hard to believe that a year has already passed since then and today—February 7, 2018—marks Roohi and Yash Johar's first birthday. 
Given the fact that Karan Johar is known for throwing some unforgettable parties at his Bandra residence, it comes as no surprise that the Bollywood director will be celebrating his kids' big day today with their best friends. However, this one might be an intimate get-together. Roohi and Yash's guest list is said to include some of Bollywood's most-loved toddlers, including Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor's daughter Misha Kapoor, Rani Mukerji and Aditya Chopra's daughter Adira Chopra, and Tusshar Kapoor's son, Laksshya Kapoor. "It's a small birthday party at home, with just kids their age," Karan Johar revealed to DNA. "I want to keep it simple and intimate this year. 
Most recently, Roohi and Yash were spotted celebrating Adira Chopra's birthday with the same set of star kids, and this Diwali, we also saw them enjoying the festival with Student Of The Year stars Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan. "People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I've been running around serving them tea and snacks. Alia Bhatt comes every other day and sits for hours," Johar once told Vogue. "I introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name. 'This is your Chacha and this is your Bua!' I give them all a family tag. I want my babies to know that their family is large." 
Scroll through our slideshow for a peek into the some of the twins' cutest moments through the past year.

Where would you wear this look? 
Malaika Arora makes it a point to step out in her sartorial best, whether she is at an event or just making social calls. Last a few weeks have been busy ones for the actor, as she travelled to Goa for her sister Amrita Arora Ladak's 40th birthday, and then played the showstopper for Label De Belle in a black sari on the last day of Lakmé Fashion Week summer/resort 2018. After a busy weekend, yesterday the actor was spotted grabbing a quick meal at a celebrity favourite dining spot in the city—Kitchen Garden by Suzette in Bandra, Mumbai.

Single celeb Malaika Arora 
Taking a break from heavily-styled looks, the actor chose a turquoise Anita Dongre kurta and pants set that spoke of comfort. The printed silk kurta styled with matching pants is perfect for a small events that require a formal dress code, like puja or an exhibition at an art gallery. The actor threw on an off-white scarf featuring floral motifs over her kurta and added some sparkle to her look with silver metallic shoes. 
The actor opted for a no-make up look, silver nails and hair tied in a messy bun. She completed her outfit with black Ray-Ban sunglasses, and no accessories except for chunky hoop earrings. 
If you're done with the heavy brocades and embellished Indian outfits but still have events that need ethnic wear, then take cues from Malaika Arora's recent look. Those who want to add a touch of drama to their look can amp up their ensemble with statement jewellery and a bold lip. Check the slideshow for a closer look at what Malaika Arora wore for her lunch date yesterday.

This is why 
Forget about what heel size is in, any fashion girl worth her salt knows that the way to upping her street cred is now measured by the kicks she owns. The last few seasons haven't witnessed just the revival of the normcore staple, but also given rise to seriously covetable versions of the athletic shoe. 
When a creative director of Nicolas Ghesquière's acumen takes matters in his own hands, the result is pretty exceptional. Louis Vuitton's version of sneakers comes with 18th century French brocade, technical fabric and an arch that will make heads turn. The Archlight sneakers that were seen on the French brand's spring/summer 2018 runway—one that was filled with sci-fi references—have hit stores.

Louis Vuttion latest Archlight sneakers are what you need for fashion month 
Ghesquière referenced sci-fi in this collection, even adding a Stranger Things T-shirt to the lineup. However, anachronism was the larger theme for the season and the Archlight sneakers with paired with embroidered coats and ruffled shirts. Carrying this forward in real life won't be a bother now that sneakers can be taken out of the athleisure context and worn with almost anything. 
The stark shape of the arch comprising of a springy sole is enough to identify the label, but just in case one is not in on what's new, Louis Vuitton's trademark logo on the trims will do the trick. Owning a pair of these is essential the trick to getting photographed outside the shows during fashion month.

Kareena Kapoor Khan, Shilpa Shetty Kundra and more 
Lakmé Fashion Week isn't just known for bringing together some of the coolest names in fashion every season. The biannual event also makes headlines across India for the long list of Bollywood showstoppers it attracts each time. This season of Lakmé Fashion Week was no different. From Day 1, the event boasted celebrities on its runway, and by the last day, it was hard to spot a show that didn't have a star walking for the shutterbugs. 
This season of Lakmé Fashion Week saw not one, but three Bollywood couples walk its runways. Coordinated in all-white ensembles, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor painted a romantic picture at Anita Dongre's showcase. As the week progressed, Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover too were seen playing showstoppers at different shows (the former walked for Reshma Kunhi, while the latter walked for Raamz & Chandrika Raamz). Following Lakmé Fashion Week tradition, Kareena Kapoor Khan walked the runway for Anamika Khanna's grand finale, just a day after husband Saif Ali Khan closed the show for Shantanu & Nikhil. 
Lakmé Fashion Week summer/resort 2018 saw several Bollywood stars walk the ramp in pastel Indian ethnic ensembles. While Sushmita Sen played ivory bride for Kotwara, Aditi Rao Hydari donned a lilac and gold lehenga for Payal Singhal. Shilpa Shetty Kundra walked Jayanti Reddy's show in a grey three-piece look, Karisma Kapoor supported Aarbee by Ravi Bhalotia in a mint green lehenga, and Tarun Tahiliani's showstopper, Kriti Sanon, closed Day 3 in a creamy lehenga featuring work in shades of pink, purple and gold. 
And the list of Bollywood showstoppers in pastel wedding wear doesn't end there. While Disha Patani walked for Shriya Som in a ruffled look, Kalki Koechlin was seen at Amoh by Jade's show in a creamy off-shoulder lehenga. Kangana Ranaut closed Shyamal & Bhumika's showcase in an embroidered ivory evening gown, and Pooja Hegde wore baby pink and white together at Ridhi Mehra's show. Among the men, Rahul Khanna too went with white at Narendra Kumar's show. 
Lakmé Fashion Week's 6Degree Studio lit up with several Bollywood showstoppers this week as well. We spotted Dia Mirza in a traditional gold sari for Sanjukta Dutta, Diana Penty in an earthy Punit Balana look, Malaika Arora in a black De Belle creation, and Tamannaah Bhatia in a shimmering red lehenga. Check out all of them in our slideshow.

Finally puts all the rumours to rest 
After months of speculation, Kylie Jenner has confirmed that she welcomed a daughter with boyfriend Travis Scott on February 1, 2018. 
Accompanying the initial Instagram post, Jenner released an 11-minute video, titled To Our Daughter, about the couple's time together during the 9 months, with Jordyn Woods as narrator. 
Woods reveals she was with Jenner when she took her pregnancy test, and tells the baby, whose name we still don't know, “when you're 20 years old you're just figuring out your life” but “there was one thing your mum new for sure, and that was you.” 
The video goes on to show Jenner's growing baby bump throughout her pregnancy, what looks to be her friends at her baby shower and even her 15-week scan. 
Kim Kardashian's baby, Chicago West, also makes an appearance in the video, meeting her aunt for the first time. 
The last few minutes of the film show Jenner and her family in the hospital ready to welcome the family's newest addition before there are periods of black screen and all that can be heard are the sounds of the doctor encouraging Jenner through her last moments of labour. 
The last thing we see is Jenner cuddling her newborn, one little arm waving about. 
Watch the video below.

The couple will reportedly take care of some work commitments before kick-starting Abhishek's birthday celebrations.

Aishwarya Rai heads off to Austria to vacation with Abhishek Bachchan and daughter Aaradhya 
At the airport, Aishwarya was seen the buggy with Aaradhya, while Abhishek chose to walk to the gate. Aishwarya was in her usual fashion uniform of black—a fitted dress, paired with knee-high black boots and one of her favourite Louboutin bags with a leopard-print accent—while Abhishek coordinated in a black leather jacket thrown over a simple white T-shirt. Aaradhya chose a travel-friendly bright blue tracksuit instead of her usual dresses, and paired her outfit with a backpack. 
The power couple was last seen vacationing in New York last June, spending some time off work with Aaradhya. One of the highlights from the trip was Abhishek's picture of Aishwarya and Aaradhya enjoying their time at the park, on a swing. Stay tuned for updates on the family's most recent vacation.

Summer is here 
From acing couple dressing at red carpet events to posing for cute wedding pictures, Mira Rajput Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor never fail in setting #CoupleGoals. Recently, the couple got everyone gushing as they played showstoppers for Anita Dongre's latest show at Lakmé Fashion Week summer/resort 2018. A day after walking the ramp in in a wedding-ready ivory lehenga, yesterday, Rajput Kapoor was spotted at Mana Shetty's Araaish charity event in Mumbai. 
For the outing, Rajput Kapoor was spotted in one of her most comfortable looks yet: a white and black printed romper. While the rolled up sleeves and knotted waist elevated the casual city vibe, the summery colour was a perfect match for the warm Mumbai weather. Rajput Kapoor accessorised her look with nothing but simple diamond earrings, matching white sneakers and a metallic cross-body sling bag. Keeping things simple, she finished with nude lips, eyeliner and hair tied in a ponytail.

Did you see what her sweatshirt says in the front?

Single Celeb Kareena Kapoor Khan 
After her night in the silver sequinned dress for Amrita Arora Ladak's starry birthday party, Kapoor Khan kept things on her way back to Mumbai. The actor has a penchant for using travel as an excuse to sport her coolest statement wear. This time, Kapoor Khan chose white ripped jeans with an oversized black sweatshirt, the front of which read “TIZZZZZ”, a word meaning "tizzy", which the actor apparently uses quite frequently (see what Swara Bhaskar had to say in her Instagram post). The actor topped off her look with black knee high boots. 
Instead of her trusty black Hermès Birkin bag, this time the actor added a pop of colour to her look with an orange one. The actor added to her travel look with trademark black sunglasses, nude lips and hair tied back in a messy bun. 
While catching a flight or stepping out for a movie with friends, choose comfort like the actor and go with on an oversized statement sweatshirt and style it with ripped denims; boots, optional. Check out the slideshow above for a closer look at Kareena Kapoor Khan's travel look.

Shahid Kapoor and wife Mira Rajput Kapoor have been a topic of interest among Bollywood fans ever since they tied the knot back in July 2015. Since their wedding, the couple have topped trending charts on several occasions, be it for pictures from casual date nights, selfies taken with their daughter Misha Kapoor, or picture-perfect moments from their frequent holidays together. 
Last night, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor had romantics all over the country liking and sharing their pictures yet again. The couple played showstoppers for Anita Dongre's latest show, which closed Day 1 of Lakmé Fashion Week summer/resort 2018. 
All soft peaches, sky blues and mint greens, Anita Dongre's showcase of elegant Indian ethnic wear came to an exciting end when the duo took over her runway. While Shahid Kapoor walked the ramp in a white sherwani worn over white trousers, Mira Rajput Kapoor looked wedding-ready in a matching ivory lehenga. Dotted with pale blue and pink florals, Rajput Kapoor's lehenga was paired with a diamond and pearl choker. Just like all the models before her, Mira Rajput Kapoor also sported tiny white blooms in her hair. 
Prior to Anita Dongre's show, Shahid Kapoor took to Instagram to share a picture-perfect backstage moment with his wife. The couple completed their walk down the runway with a playful twirl and a hug for the cameras. They were also seen sharing a quick conversation on the ramp. 
With each season of Lakmé Fashion Week comes an exciting list of celebrity guests. At Anita Dongre's show, the front row included Diana Penty, Sagarika Ghatge, Shamita Shetty, Yami Gautam, Shriya Saran and Isabelle Kaif, the newest member of the Lakmé family.

Toss that rulebook 
If you've been keeping up with the latest in Bollywood, you would know that sisters Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan and their entire girl gang including Amrita Arora Ladak, Malaika Arora, Natasha Poonawalla and others were spotted travelling to Goa for Amrita Arora's 40th birthday bash. Once there, the stars brought out their sartorial best in shimmery outfits for the celebration. 
Karisma Kapoor was spotted at the party in a glamorous strapless black and golden maxi dress by Reem Acra. The ensemble featured a shimmery metallic pleated skirt, with cut-out detailing on the bodice that showed off the actor's mid-riff. While Kapoor, who is 43, is often spotted in breezy casual looks, she is also seen going all out in body hugging silhouettes and sweeping gowns, and is partial to shimmery outfits, proving that your wardrobe doesn't need to be bound by age. 
Taking her look up a notch, the actor accessorised her look with gold earrings by Joules By Radhika. With the spotlight on her strapless number, the actor kept her beauty look simple with her staples: heavily kohl-lined eyes, dewy make-up and red lips. 
In pictures that she put up on her Instagram account yesterday, we spotted her enjoying Amrita Arora's birthday bash with some of her closest friends including Saif Ali Khan, Natasha Poonawalla, Malaika Arora, Seema Khan, Dolly Sidhwani, Maheep Kapoor and Mallika Bhat.

Every single picture you missed 
Just hours ago, pictures of Kareena Kapoor Khan boarding a private jet to Goa with her favourite people surfaced on social media, and had the star's fans everywhere talking. Dressed in an oversized white shirt and sunnies, Kareena Kapoor Khan was making her way to Goa with husband Saif Ali Khan, sister Karisma Kapoor and friends Malaika Arora, Natasha Poonawalla, Maheep Kapoor and Dolly Sidhwani to bring in her best friend, Amrita Arora Ladak's 40th birthday. 
Upon reaching their mansion in Goa, Kapoor Khan and her crew spent the afternoon leading up to Amrita Arora Ladak's birthday soaking up some sun by the pool. While the birthday girl picked an ultramarine blue fringed dress for the day, Kapoor Khan opted for a Gucci tee featuring an AC/DC logo, and Malaika Arora picked a tangerine mini. 
For the eve of her 40th birthday, Amrita Arora Ladak changed up her tasseled maxi for a nude number embroidered with multi-coloured sequins. By the looks of it, the actor picked ‘shimmer and shine' as the dress code for her big celebration. We spotted Kareena Kapoor Khan taking pictures with the birthday girl in an asymmetrical silver number, Karisma Kapoor posing in a black and gold Reem Acra maxi, and Malaika Arora in a feathery blouse worn with white sequin shorts. To top off their party looks, most guests opted for dramatic headgear. As for the men, both Saif Ali Khan and Shakeel Ladak joined in wearing simple black shirts, adding a festive touch to their look with feather-studded head bands too. 
Some of the cutest pictures from the evening included Shakeel Ladak's Insta post wishing his wife a happy 40th, a cosy snapshot of Kareena Kapoor Khan perched on Saif Ali Khan's lap, and a party-ready edition of the Kapoor and Arora sisters' trademark group photo. The four are known to be very close to each other, and are always seen celebrating each other's biggest moments together. Catch up on all the pictures you missed via our slideshow.

Here are all the details 
Kareena Kapoor Khan and sister Karisma Kapoor are seldom seen without their BFFs, sibling duo Malaika Arora and Amrita Arora Ladak. The crew of four come together for occasions big and small, be it brunches at the Taj, Christmas parties or birthdays. And this week will be no different. 
Come January 31, Amrita Arora will celebrate her 40th birthday. And to mark the big moment, the Kapoor sisters are jet-setting off to Goa today. Joined by Saif Ali Khan, Natasha Poonawalla, Malaika Arora, Seema Khan, Dolly Sidhwani, Maheep Kapoor and Mallika Bhat, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor were spotted entering what could be Poonawalla's private jet this afternoon dressed in their off-duty best. 
While Kapoor brought together stripes and polka dots in a grey and black look, Kapoor Khan looked pristine in an oversized white and sunnies. Heavy-duty leather jackets were Arora and Poonawalla's pick for the day, with the former opting for a floral print version of the travel staple, and the latter picking a tasslled and studded avatar. Saif Ali Khan opted for a leather jacket as well. His pick: a classic black creation featuring lots of zips. 
While Amrita Arora Ladak hasn't been spotted in the latest pictures so far, the captions on Karisma Kapoor and Malaika Arora's posts promise tonight will be an eventful one for the birthday girl. While Arora captioned her group picture with “Let's get this party started”, Kapoor made sure to mention “#amus40th” and “friendshipgoals” in her travel-ready picture.

Taimur Ali Khan’s play school pictures are too cute to miss 
Since his birth, Taimur's envy-worthy wardrobe has been talked about several times. We've seen him make appearances in dinosaur-print rompers, Ralph Lauren puffer jackets, and Christmas-themed sweatshirts. In a recent interview, Taimur's mother Kareena Kapoor Khan spoke up about his style, saying, "I like dressing him up because I like doing it, not for the paparazzi. I am happy for him to get clicked in his kurta pyjamas also." 
As it turns out, Taimur wasn't the only Bollywood kid who had fans talking this weekend. In case you missed it, Shahid and Mira Rajput Kapoor's daughter Misha Kapoor (who was also spotted at school last week), used her weekend off to take some adorable pictures with her dad. Captioned "Happy Sunday", Shahid's post with his little girl has already earned more than 1,550,000 likes.

In 2014, singer-songwriter Kesha sued producer Dr Luke on grounds of sexual, verbal, emotional and physical abuse, garnering support from not just her fans, but peers like Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato, Lorde, Lady Gaga, Kelly Clarkson and Adele. In wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, the climate in which abuse is discussed has changed drastically tipping the scales in favour of the victims.

Empower newsletter: solidarity for Kesha, backlash against Padmaavat and more 
Before her Grammys 2018 performance, Kesha took the stage to make a moving speech about this most pertinent issue, “We come in peace but we mean business. And to those who would dare try to silence us. We offer two words: Time's up. We say time's up for pay inequality. Time's up for discrimination. Time's up for harassment of any kind. And time's up for the abuse of power because you see it's not just going on in Hollywood, it's not just going on in Washington, it's right here in our industry. And just as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo the culture that doesn't serve us well,” said the signer songwriter. 
Celebrities are also using awards shows as platforms to raise awareness. At the Grammy Awards, celebrities were seen sporting a white rose to show their support for the Time's Up movement. 
Meanwhile director  finally hit theatres after enduring several protests, threats, cuts in the original screenplay and the loss of a letter in the original name of the film. 
Amidst the controversy and delays surrounding Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat, which finally released last week, actor Swara Bhaskar wrote an open letter to the director, calling him out for glorifying misogynistic rituals, focusing on the fact that victims of rape too have the right to live. 
"Surely Sir, you agree that Sati, and Jauhar are not practices to be glorified. Surely, you agree that notwithstanding whatever archaic idea of honour, sacrifice, purity propels women and men to participate in and condone such practices; that basically Sati and Jauhar, like the practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and Honour Killings, are steeped in deeply patriarchal, misogynist and problematic ideas. A mentality that believes that the worth of women lies in their vaginas, that female lives are worthless if the women are no longer controlled by male owners or if their bodies have been ‘desecrated' by the touch of ; or even the gaze of a male who doesn't by social sanction ‘own' or ‘control' the female,” she wrote in the original letter to the director. 
American retailer Abercrombie & Fitch has released a line of gender neutral clothing for children called the ‘Everybody Collection'. The line features 25 styles inspired by skate and streetwear. The collection is available both online and in stores and targets kids between ages 5-14.

Style cues from the Bollywood celebrity 
Alia Bhatt has been acing Indian ethnic wear this month. After celebrating her friend Kripa Mehta's wedding in three striking looks, the actor was seen at an event in Mumbai in a black and white floor-grazing anarkali by Anita Dongre. 
Given the busy detailing on the entire length of the anarkali with floral and architectural motifs, the star wore the look without a dupatta. The look featured sheer sleeves, which is a great compromise if the occasion calls for a modest dress code but the weather doesn't permit stuffy, solid full sleeves.

Alia Bhatt makes a case for monochromatic Indian ethnic wear 
The actor kept things simple in the accessories department—a pair of silver jhumkas by Amrapali was all the anarkali was paired with. Keeping the easy theme going, Bhatt went with soft waves, peachy lips, highlighter and a tiny black bindi for the evening. She was joined by Anushka Sharma at the event, who also chose a look by Anita Dongre and was spotted performing a little dance with Bhatt for the audience. 
Traditionally, wearing black to a puja ceremony may not be an option, but you can still wear the colour to an engagement party or to a friend's reception. While the anarkali worn by Bhatt was simple and she chose to go the minimal way with the rest of her look as well, you could choose to amp up the glamour of the outfit with bolder polki jewellery, a brighter lip colour and a pair of towering stilettos. 
Scroll through our gallery for a closer look at Alia Bhatt's monochromatic anarkali.

Did you see her in the Manish Malhotra creation? 
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has had a busy week. Just days after receiving the the First Ladies Award in a an ivory and gold Sabyasachi sari in Delhi, recently, Rai Bachchan bagged the Timeless Style Diva Award at HT Most Stylish Awards in Mumbai, in a midnight blue Manish Malhotra lehenga.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan adds another Manish Malhotra lehenga to her ethnic wardrobe 
Manish Malhotra, a friend of Rai Bachchan's, had created a special showcase titled 'The Gold Story' for the evening, and the actor made her support felt in a midnight blue and mint green lehenga from his collection. The actor paired her voluminous lehenga skirt with a long, full-sleeved choli. The look—with intricate golden work on the bodice of the blouse, the skirt and the dupatta—would be a great option for a bride looking for a modest, yet glamorous lehenga for her wedding wardrobe. 
And this wasn't the first time the actor swapped a cropped choli in favour of an extended one: remember her ivory high-shine lehenga from Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's Mumbai reception? 
Keeping her accessories minimal, the actor went nothing but a sleek gold ring. Rai Bachchan maintained understated elegance with her make up and went with nude lips, dewy makeup and naturally blow-dried hair. For the award ceremony, the actor was accompanied by her father-in-law, Amitabh Bachchan. 
Planning your wedding trousseau? If cropped, mid riff-baring cholis are not for you, take cues from Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's recent ensemble and pair your lehenga with a longer  blouse. 
Check out our slideshow for a closer look at what Aishwarya Rai Bachchan wore at the event.

Famous quotes from the ground-breaking novelist 
Today's Google Doodle features Adeline Virginia Woolf, a personality synonymous with modernist literature. The author began writing as a young girl and published her first novel, The Voyage Out, in 1915. Born in London in 1882 into a privileged household, Woolf was raised by free-thinking parents. Some her most famous works include Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse and Orlando. Her feminist works include A Room of One's Own and Three Guineas. 
Google's Doodle updates often feature exemplary women from around the world who were pioneers in their own fields. Woolf revolutionised fiction, however suffered bouts of deep depression and took her own life in 1941 at the age of 59. Her influence has far outlasted her life, helping to push the structural possibilities of literature, showing and proving to us repeatedly that a person's inner life is as complex and compelling as any plot can be. 
Today marks the 136th anniversary of her birth and to celebrate it, Google dedicated the subject of the Google Doodle today to Virginia Woolf. 
“For most of history, Anonymous was a woman.” 
“As a woman I have no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.” 
“I thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out; and I thought how it is worse, perhaps, to be locked in.” 
“If you do not tell the truth about yourself, you cannot tell it about other people.” 
“Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.” 
“Fiction is like a spider's web, attached ever so slightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners. Often the attachment is scarcely perceptible.” 
“Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size” 
“The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.” 
“I don't believe in aging. I believe in forever altering one's aspect to the sun.” 
“I am made and remade continually. Different people draw different words from me.”

This year's edition of the HT Most Stylish Awards wasn't like any before it. Hosted by one of Bollywood's favourite designers, Manish Malhotra, the 2018 edition of the annual ceremony took place at Mumbai's Yash Raj Studios last night, and saw more than just a handful of celebrity guests. 
There to celebrate Bollywood's most stylish, and to check out Malhotra's special showcase for the evening—'The Gold Story', an opulent show put together just for his favourite people—were close to 30 stars. 
The guest list included Deepika Padukone, Shahid and Mira Rajput Kapoor, Sridevi, Sonakshi Sinha, Sonam Kapoor, Shilpa Shetty Kundra, Kriti Sanon, Diana Penty, Rekha, Parineeti Chopra, Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu, Huma Qureshi, Sanjay Dutt, Vaani Kapoor, Sophie Choudry, Kiara Advani, Farhan Akhtar, and many more.

Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor & Sridevi at 2018’s HT Most Stylish Awards 
While Padukone kept her look for the evening traditional in a pink and gold sari gifted to her by Rekha, both Sanon and Sonam Kapoor walked the red carpet in eye-catching yellow numbers. The former experimented with a fringed Deme by Gabriella maxi, and the latter opted for a one-shoulder Hyun Mi Nielsen dress with diamond jewellery. Shetty, Penty and Choudry honoured Malhotra by picking shimmering ensembles by the couturier, while Rajput Kapoor kept her look sleek in a slinky white Monisha Jaising and Sinha layered up against the January chill in Nikhil Thampi. As for Sridevi, Shetty Kundra and Vaani Kapoor, nothing but top-to-toe sequins would do. We spotted the first in baby pink, the second in a silver Reem Acra gown, and the third in a black Redemption number. Check out everything else the stars wore on the red carpet in our slideshow now.

Would you dare to try her gown? 
Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor are, without a doubt, one of Bollywood's most-followed couples. From stepping out for low-key dinner dates to spending time with their daughter Misha, the two are the picture of a modern family. After attending the Padmaavat screening the day before, the couple were spotted attending the HT Most Stylish Awards last night. 
Making a striking picture together, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput Kapoor complemented each other with the colour scheme of their wardrobe. Rajput Kapoor picked a white Monisha Jaising gown, while Shahid Kapoor chose a checkered suit by Gaurav Gupta worn with a white shirt by Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna. Rajput Kapoor's sleek white number featured star-shaped detailing, which added a youthful element to the elegant, formal silhouette of the dress. 
Rajput Kapoor accessorised her look with nothing but studded earrings by H. Ajoomal Fine Jewellery and a multi-layered gold ring by Prakshi Fine Jewelry. She completed her beauty look with nude lips, kohl-lined eyes and straight hair. 
Before stepping out for the event, the couple also took to their respective Instagram accounts to share an inside glimpse of their evening with their fans. Shahid Kapoor's mirror selfie, which also gives us a peek at their stylish, urban home, was captioned "Evening swag. ❤️". 
If you're wondering how to coordinate your look for a swish evening with your better half without looking too matchy, take style cues from the couple's recent look.

What did you think of her anarkali? 
Deepika Padukone is more often than not on top of the game when it comes to Indian ethnic wear. With Padmaavat finally releasing on January 26, the actor was seen at the Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai yesterday along with co-star Ranveer Singh in an off-white anarkali by Anamika Khanna. Singh accompanied Padukone in a white kurta churidar set by Herringbone & Sui—and the chemistry between the two is evident from the way they held their hands throughout to their coordinated outfits. 
In case you feel that you've seen Padukone's anarkali before, you're not mistaken. The star was seen in the same Anamika Khanna ensemble back in 2013 while promoting Chennai Express, proving that even celebrities recycle their wardrobe, just like us. While the border of the anarkali featured silver gota work and a dramatic slit, the dupatta was detailed with white beaded embroidery. Later in the evening, the actor was seen at a private screening of Padmaavat in the same outfit. 
Padukone accessorised her look with oversized gold and pearl chaandbalis, and silver juttis. The actor added finishing touches to her look by way of nude lips, dewy make-up and mascara, with her hair tied up in a neat bun.

Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh step out in coordinated outfits 
While Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh have hardly been seen together during the previous promotional events for Padmaavat, the pair finally showed up hand-in-hand at the screening. 
Padukone's versatile anarkali can easily be taken from a formal day event to a puja. The trick to styling an understated, elegant garment such as this one is to balance the simplicity with the right accessories. Those looking to amp up their all-white outfit can add a pop of colour via oversized earrings or red lips. Scroll through our gallery for a closer look at Deepika Padukone's anarkali.

Solid hues for the win 
Yesterday, all eyes were on Alia Bhatt, who joined her friends in Jodhpur for Kripa Mehta's wedding. The actor was seen in a pastel pink Gauri & Nainika number for a polo match, and then picked another Koëcsh lehenga for the wedding ceremony. This time around, Bhatt opted for an embellished grey version, styled with sparkling Amrapali jewellery.

What Nimrat Kaur and Kriti Sanon wore on 22/01/2018 
Just like Bhatt, the rest of Bollywood opted for either solid washes of colour or simple prints yesterday. While Kangana Ranaut picked an ashy grey sari at Mumbai airport, both Kareena Kapoor Khan and Kriti Sanon went with black separates. We spotted Kapoor Khan entering her gym in a cosy striped top with black leggings, and Sanon paired her metallic Skechers with a vinyl skirt and printed blouse. 
Richa Chadha made a pop in a mustard yellow Monika Nidhii sharara set, and Nimrat Kaur went all white in Delhi. The two stars who really stood out last afternoon were Shilpa Shetty Kundra and Malaika Arora. Both actors went with shades of red, with the former picking a scarlet jumpsuit with gold accessories, and the latter draped in a maroon Lola by Suman B wrap dress. 
Overseas, it was Bella Hadid that took over trending charts with her latest OOTD. The model went risqué in a sheer Dior number in Paris featuring silver embroidery. Check out the full look in our slideshow.

Here's everything you need to know 
It was back in December 2000, just months after the release of Hrithik Roshan's debut Bollywood film Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai, that the star tied the knot with childhood sweetheart Sussanne Khan. Over the years, the couple became one of the Indian film industry's most followed duos, growing their family by two when sons Hrehaan and Hridhaan Roshan were born. 
It came as a surprise for Hrithik Roshan and Sussanne Khan's fans all over the world when just a week shy of their 13th wedding anniversary, the couple announced their separation to the media. While rumours abound during the course of their divorce, the couple chose to maintain a united front, and at the time of the separation, Roshan had taken to Facebook to say, “This is my greatest tribute to love. Sussanne is and always will be the love of my life for the rest of my life. If her smiles are brighter without me my love for her must accomplish that. Unconditional.” 
After 17 years of being together, Roshan and Khan's divorce was finalised in Mumbai on November 1, 2014. “They have got divorced in a very unique and elegant way where there is no alimony and not a single document drawn up between them,” Roshan's lawyer Deepesh Mehta had said in a statement to the media at the time. “It's all on a basis of trust, respect and faith.” 
But though they have been legally divorced for close to three years, Hrithik Roshan and Sussanne Khan have seamlessly maintained their close friendship. In the recent past, we've seen the two celebrating each other's birthdays together, hanging out with common friends over and again, and in December 2017, we even spotted them bringing in the new year with their sons in Rhône-Alps. 
Now, rumour has it that the two may tie the knot once again. According to a common friend, “Hrithik and Sussanne are working it out. They identified the stress areas in their relationship and are doing their best to work their way around them. Give them time-they will come together again.” However, another source reveals, “They are done with one another—to even suggest that they can be a couple again is ridiculous.” As the world waits for a confirmation, here's a look at some of their sweetest moments together in the past months.

Can you keep up with her wedding wardrobe? 
In case you missed the updates on Instagram, Alia Bhatt has been busy enjoying her best friend Kripa Mehta's wedding to Yash Mehta in Jodhpur, and Bhatt's designer wardrobe for all the days has been a masterclass in dressing for a destination wedding. After stepping out in a sunny yellow anarkali by Manish Malhotra and a glittering lehenga by Koëcsh by Krésha Bajaj for the sangeet ceremony, the actor kept her sartorial streak going with two more scene-stealing outfits. 
Taking a break from ethnic dressing, the actor opted for peach Gauri & Nainika dress for the polo brunch. The dress, featuring minimal floral embroidery and frill details, was perfect for the occasion. The actor accessorised her day look with a beige fascinator by Delna Poonawalla, and minimal gold stud earrings. She kept her beauty look simple with pink lips, dewy skin, shimmery eye shadow and hair tied in a ponytail.

Single Celeb: Alia Bhatt 
The main wedding ceremony in the evening consisted of a bridal procession, with Kripa Mehta arriving in a chariot to the venue, accompanied by her crew—much like a baraat. For this, Bhatt chose another outfit from Koëcsh by Krésha Bajaj's recent collection—a grey lehenga worn with a sheer dupatta, featuring shimmery embellishments. 
When it came to accessories, the actor went with over-sized silver earrings and a matching maang tikka by Amrapali Jewels and a silver bag. Bhatt maintained understated elegance with her makeup and went with nude lips, heavy mascara and hair tied in a braided bun.

The people, movements and hashtags making headlines last week 
The year 2018 has been #woke to say the least. Between the war cries of #TimesUp, the second Women's March and conversations around inclusivity, the first month of the year is far from over, yet those fighting the fight for feminism have accomplished so much already.

Essential reading: James Franco, Pad Man and more 
Twinkle Khanna's debut production feature Pad Man traces the real-life story of Arunachalam Muruganantham, the man who contributed to raising awareness about sanitary hygiene in rural South India. Sonam Kapoor along with director R Balki visited schoolgirls and distributed sanitary napkins to them as a part of promotional activity for the film, which is set to release on February 9. 
James Franco was recently accused of sexual misconduct by five women. Sarah Tither-Kaplan, a former student of Franco's, along with others, spoke to Los Angeles Times about the many times they felt exploited by Franco's behaviour. Alison Brie, who is married to Franco's younger brother Dave Franco, commented on the matter at the Screen Actors Guild Awards saying, “I obviously support my family. And not everything that's been reported is fully accurate, so I think we're waiting to get all the information. But, of course, now is the time for listening and that's what we're all trying to do.” Franco himself has denied the allegations. “The things that I heard were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn't have a voice for so long,” he told celebrity TV host Stephen Colbert. 
The second edition of the Women's March took place on January 21 in Washington DC. Hundreds of women gathered to raise their voices against President Trump's administration. Amidst the protests, stars also took the March as opportunity to keep the momentum alive on the #TimesUp movement. Natalie Portman, Eva Longoria, Viola Davis, Olivia Munn, Lupita Nyong'o and Jennifer Lawrence were amongst the celebrities who were seen there. Scarlet Johansson called out James Franco in light of the recent accusations made against him. However, Johansson faced backlash for singling out Franco while having worked in three Woody Allen films; the filmmaker has been accused of molestation by his own adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow. 
L'Oréal made headlines by featuring model Amena Khan in a haircare commercial. Khan, who wears a hijab in the advert ,was a part of the Elvive campaign spreading the message of inclusivity. “You have to wonder—why is it presumed that women that don't show their hair don't look after it?” she told Vogue.co.uk.

Check out what the star has been up to 
Whether it is spreading the word for global causes or grabbing eyeballs for her sartorial choices, not a week goes by without Priyanka Chopra making the headlines. The Bollywood star, who has successfully made her name in Hollywood—first with her lead role in the American series Quantico and for her work in her debut Hollywood film, Baywatch—was recently spotted hanging out with R&B musician Usher.

Priyanka Chopra spotted hanging out with this American musician 
The global icon is currently living in New York to shoot for the third season of Quantico, and was recently on a break from shooting to promote her second Hollywood film, A Kid Like Jake at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. 
Chopra took to her Instagram account to post pictures with lead crew members of the movie that included everyone from Octavia Spencer, Claire Danes from Homeland and Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory fame. The star also shared details about her upcoming film in the caption of the post, that read: “So proud to be a part of #AKidLikeJake, a story that humanizes the struggle of parents trying to do right by their kid. This film breaks down the barriers of being socially correct, and encourages you to embraces the qualities that makes each one of us unique. So happy to bring my support to this already stellar cast. See you at the pictures... 🙌🏻 #SundanceFilmFestival.” 
The actor sported a an off-white turtleneck with her olive green blazer and camouflage skinny jeans for the event, where she met Usher and made sure she got a picture with him for her Instagram. 
The former Miss World is set to join the list of actors announcing nominations at this year's Oscars. The official Twitter account for the Academy Awards posted a photo Priyanka Chopra shooting for the nominations film, along with the likes of Rosario Dawson, Michelle Rodriguez and Rebel Wilson. After last year's white Ralph & Russo gown that she sported for the event, we wonder what the star will pick for the 90th Academy Awards that will be held on March 4, 2018, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California.

Keep up with the latest news about the mother-daughter duo 
Amidst all the controversies and bleak news stories, it wouldn't be completely incorrect to say that the babies of Bollywood have been a ray of sunshine through the past few months, and Misha Kapoor heading for her first day of school was the highlight of the weekend. Misha and mother Mira Kapoor have become a something of a favourite with the paparazzi, with pictures of the duo regularly doing rounds on the internet. 
In the latest addition to this archive, Misha was spotted with mother Mira Kapoor, apparently ready for her first day at what could be preschool. While Mira chose a casual look with a white top and jeans with a grey button-down thrown over, it was baby Misha who stole the limelight. The little one was adorable in a pale blue shirt dress, with a striped belt on her waist. Her all-white shoes were very on-trend and the perfect accessory to finish off the ensemble.

Misha Kapoor attends first day at school, and school uniforms have never looked cuter! 
Doting parents Shahid and Mira Kapoor regularly take to Instagram to share charming family portraits of the trio, giving their fans a daily dose of aww-worthy moments. In a recent post by dad Shahid, young Misha can be spotted in a ruffled red dress, literally trying to fill some pretty large shoes, presumably belonging to her dad. In another snapshot shared by Mira, Misha, dressed in a printed kurta and white leggings, looks on as her dance teacher performs. Needless to say, baby Misha has already acquired celebrity status, and fans can't wait for more updates on the toddler, whether it's a park date with her mom, or her first day at school.

Don't miss these pictures 
This weekend has been a busy one for Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Just hours after partying with Mickey Contractor at Mumbai's Arth restaurant (the makeup pro completed 12 successful years with M.A.C cosmetics), the actor flew over to Delhi to receive a prestigious award.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan received this prestigious award in a must-see sari 
Rai Bachchan was seen at the Rashtrapati Bhawan this weekend, receiving the First Ladies Award from the president of India, Ram Nath Kovind. The award, which aims to celebrate women who are the first to set a milestone in their field, was given to Rai Bachchan for becoming the first female Indian actor to be part of a jury at Cannes Film Festival. In total, the awards ceremony felicitated women from 112 different fields this year. 
For her big moment, Rai Bachchan went the traditional route with an ivory and gold Sabyasachi sari, draped over a maroon blouse. To complete her look, the actor opted for shimmering peep toe heels and gold chandelier earrings. As for her beauty look for the evening, nothing would do but Rai Bachchan's now iconic combo: razor-sharp winged liner, traffic-stopping scarlet lips and sleek, straight locks. Joining Rai Bachchan at the celebration was environmentalist Maneka Gandhi. 
Over the years, Rai Bachchan has walked the red carpet at Cannes close to 15 times. The ex-Miss World was made a Cannes jury member back in 2003, and even had one of her latest films, Jazbaa, premiere at the annual film festival in 2015. Some of her most memorable on-screen roles have included that of Nandini in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), Paro in Devdas (2002), Sunehri in Dhoom 2 (2006) and Dalbir Kaur in Sarbjit (2016). In the near future, fans of the star may also get to see her play a surrogate mother in Jasmine: A Story of a Leased Womb, and a songstress obsessed with Lata Mangeshkar in Fanne Khan.

Wedding-ready anarkalis, red carpet gowns and more 
This weekend, Bollywood brought its A-game to the red carpet for 2018's Filmfare Awards. We spotted Alia Bhatt experiment with flouncy layers in a pastel Monsoori gown, Rekha ditch Kanjivaram saris for a metallic Manish Malhotra drape, Sonam Kapoor work city shorts with a blazer, and Parineeti Chopra go sleek in a black and silver Kujta & Meri gown. Another face that had everyone talking: Sara Ali Khan, who stepped out in an anarkali-style coat by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla.

What Sara Ali Khan and Sonam Kapoor wore on 21/01/2018 
But if you thought the awards ceremony was the only big talking point in the past two days, you couldn't be more wrong. The stars used the rest of the weekend to step out in Indian ethnic ensembles that every baraati needs to check out. While Bhatt partied at friend Kripa Mehta's Jodhpur wedding in a sunny yellow Manish Malhotra (and then again in a romantic Koëcsh lehenga), Kapoor promoted Pad Man in a silvery grey Rimzim Dadu kurta, and Shraddha Kapoor went elegant in a baby pink Anita Dongre creation. Favouring saris over anarkalis, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan gave all-black ensembles a break with an ivory Sabyasachi drape, and Malaika Arora picked a floral Ritu Kumar version of the Indian staple. 
And then there were the Bollywood ladies who went with western OOTDs this weekend. While Deepika Padukone stepped out of Mumbai airport in ripped jeans and a not-so-basic leather jacket, Karisma Kapoor was seen in Nachiket Barve in Jodhpur. Katrina Kaif visited Manish Malhotra's house in a red Alexander McQueen number, and Priyanka Chopra worked military green for her outing. Want to know what else the stars wore?

Guess who else was present? 
Mrs Funnybones aka Twinkle Khanna's much-awaited debut production Pad Man, is finally set to hit the big screens, and the promotions are in full swing. As part of the promotional rounds, Khanna spoke at the Oxford Union—one of the most reputed debating societies in the world, which has held audiences for the likes of Shashi Tharoor, the Dalai Lama, Michael Jackson, Malala Yousafzai, Salman Rushdie and Morgan Freeman. Khanna was dressed in head-to-toe Gucci for the occasion.

Twinkle Khanna addresses at the Oxford Union in head-to-toe Gucci 
In view of the formal context of the event, the author chose a printed suit, worn with a broken white ruffled blouse. The wide lapel of the blazer and high-waisted trousers added a '70s spin to the outfit. Khanna went with curled hair and fuss-free make up to ensure that the suit was the hero of the look. 
After the address, the author/producer posed for a photo-op in a dress featuring abstract print by Massimo Dutti. She was joined by Sonam Kapoor, who went with a siren red pantsuit by Kojak Studio. If you were considering taking the pantsuit out of the boardroom, Khanna and Kapoor will further cement resolve. 
Pad Man, which releases on January 26, narrates the story of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a man who has contributed significantly in raising awareness about sanitary hygiene in rural South India. The film, starring husband Akshay Kumar and Sonam Kapoor, is set to further illuminate the masses on the stigma attached to menstruation.

On being a dusky model in an industry that prizes fairness 
The colour of your skin is a point of merit in a country like ours. If you were to take the popular opinion, the lighter your perfect shade of foundation, the better you look. Indian model and actor Nidhi Sunil—you've probably spotted her on local and international runways, in commercials around the globe, or in your copy of Vogue India—who's been in the business for over seven years now, was recently trolled on her Instagram account because of her dark-coloured skin. On a picture from a shoot for a travel magazine, an Instagram account called @GoanForever (with 0 posts or followers, but following 1,091 accounts), commented about how she's dark-skinned and needs to wear a swimsuit to get attention. Here, an unfazed Sunil talks about the incident, and what it's like to be a dark-skinned model in a country that is obsessed with fairness. 
On what actually transpired on Instagram I uploaded an image from the shoot and a few hours later, I noticed a lot of comments. Most of them came from one account and other people interacting with that account. One of these was my friend and another person who I don't even know, and they were just being very nice and standing up for me. The troll was going on and on about how I wasn't good enough to be a model—it's definitely an Instagram account made for trolling, because it has no posts of its own but follows over a thousand people. 
On modelling in India and overseas When I started modelling in India, it was definitely a problem to be my skin tone. There were girls like Carol Gracious who were doing runway but that was because they were all super tall, which I'm not. You can't do print or TV commercials [if you're dark]—you basically couldn't work with brands because the way you look would never sell anything. There's the perception that if you're a dark girl who wants to be a fashion model, you have to be very tall; and people won't accept you on TV, print or billboards because you don't look "aspirational". There's definitely not as much representation internationally for us, as there is for the fair-skinned. 
It's a very chicken-and-egg situation when it comes to what should change as opposed to what is the status quo. While people will say that this is not what the public wants, it's also upon us to educate the public about what it is. It is changing because social media has given people a platform to speak out and be an activist; more likely to find themselves being in a situation where they become an activist like I did. When you have an opinion and people resonate with that opinion, you have a storm brewing about the issue at hand. 
On the need for diversity Even now a show overseas might have 16 white girls, three black models, three Asian models and maybe one brown model—now—one representing India. I've done a lot more commercial work abroad than I've done fashion weeks because my height is an issue, but I've worked for brands like American Apparel and Walmart. A lot of brands are now focusing on diversity, so they're definitely pushing their marketing teams to put together a campaign that focuses on their brand being worldly and representing as many sections of society as they can. In fact, a lot of people don't think I'm Indian, not even in India, which was another problem because then I wouldn't resonate with the Indian market. Some people think I'm Nigerian, Ethiopian, South American and even Spanish. 
On the reality of the bias One of my bookers in 2011 told me that I wasn't tall enough to be a runway model and wasn't fair enough to be a commercial model, so they weren't sure what they could do with me—that really stuck with me. I was asked to get rid of my freckles because your skin is supposed to be completely clear, otherwise it's not "beautiful". A lot of people aren't as blatant though. When you go for casting, they won't tell you on your face that you're dark and that's why they're not hiring you, but that has happened. Now in Bombay, when I get a call for an ad commercial, I tell them to not approach me if they want a fair girl at the end of the day. A lot of times I've encountered directors who want to work with me but their clients don't want to; they don't think a dusky girl will work for them. 
On working with beauty brands When I signed a two-year contract with a leading beauty FMCG, they told me that I was the darkest girl they've ever worked with. As a dark girl, it's a bit bizarre. Somehow because I'm born with this skin colour, everything a non-dusky person would do, that's not much of an achievement, becomes one because I [as a dark girl] did it. Even when people are trying to be kind and generous, they don't treat you like a normal person. I don't know what they mean when they say things like, “Oh, you're a dark girl and you're doing so well.” What happened to just being a person who's doing well? The prejudice is so ingrained. 
It's sad to say but everything I do, every milestone I cross, which might not be a milestone for somebody who doesn't have dark skin, adds up. Things like winning the award for Vogue Model Of The Year, or a brand  having a dark girl as their face for two years [are encouraging]—especially when the girl with the bad hair in my commercial was fair. I got a call from a whitening beauty brand to cast me. I never went for it—I'm not a fair girl, why would I? Turns out, the ‘brightening' gradation you see in advertisements for fairness products is easier to show [in post-production] on dark skin than on fair. 
On advice to upcoming models It's actually very brave to be a model. People don't tell you this when you start out because it's so glamorised. You have to learn to be okay with a lot of your own demons and the criticism—you're never enough, even if you have everything. There are people who will put you down just to take their frustration off on someone, regardless of how good you are. If you have no faith or belief in yourself, you might as well give up. I was speaking to Bhumika Arora in New York and she told me about how bad of a time she had. We started at the same time in India and she started as a Delhi model, and there isn't much work there for her besides walking for fashion shows. She would tell me how often she'd be in tears because of choreographers. You simply have to believe in yourself. 
On what the ideal future of modelling would be I've heard stories of curvy models being told they're too fat to be a regular model but not fat enough to be a curvy model. Ageism needs to go—you should be able to model across ages. Things need to change, there are a few smaller shows overseas letting go of these paradigms. We like to put things in boxes so it feels safe. I want paradigms to fall, all physical paradigms.

A beautiful retrospective 
If you're a Bollywood lover and follow beauty industry closely, you've definitely heard of Mickey Contractor. Director of makeup artistry at M.A.C Cosmetics India, a favourite with celebrities from Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Kajol to Alia Bhatt, Vogue Beauty Awards judge since year one (it's now been a decade) and all-round makeup genius, Contractor may not be in the limelight as much as the faces he works on, but his name is every bit as prolific.

Looking back on Mickey Contractor’s best shoots for Vogue India 
At 150k followers strong on Instagram, Contractor's hands have been behind many iconic Bollywood beauty looks you've seen on the big screen, including Kajol and Rani Mukerji in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Kareena Kapoor Khan in the 2001 hit Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (he even won an IIFA Award for Best Makeup for this one) and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016). Most recently, he has worked with Kapoor Khan for her upcoming film Veere Di Wedding, that releases in June this year. 
While he started his beauty journey by working at a hairdressing salon in the 1970s, a chance meeting with Bollywood legend Helen had him give makeup a shot. And the rest, as they say, is history. In the decade that Vogue India has been around, he's shot multiple editorials with numerous A-list celebrities, models and personalities, each one stunning in its own right. 
While his first was our December 2008 cover shoot with Kareena Kapoor Khan, he worked on covers with Deepika Padukone, Kajol and Jacqueline Fernandez; Madhuri Dixit Nene in 2011; Mehr Rampal, Kajol and Alia Bhatt in 2012; Parineeti Chopra in the next year; with Jacqueline Fernandez in 2015; along with cover shoots with Jaya Bachchan, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Navya Naveli Nanda in their first ever shoot together in 2017, and Nita Ambani in our anniversary issue. 
Flip through the gallery above for a glimpse at Mickey Contractor's most beautiful shoots with Vogue India.

See how they made the announcement 
Kim Kardashian West has welcomed her third child - and second daughter - with husband Kanye West, the reality television star announced on her website today. 
In a post titled "She's Here!", Kardashian West revealed that the baby girl, who was born via a surrogate, arrived on Monday January 15 at 12.47am and weighed 7lbs 6oz. 
“Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,” Kardashian West wrote. “We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.” Having previously spoken about her struggles to conceive another child, she confirmed in November that she and West - who married in 2014 - were expecting again, this time using a surrogate. 
While there is no news yet on the name given to their baby daughter, she added that their older children - four-year-old North and two-year-old Saint - are "especially thrilled" to welcome their new sister.

Few do drama better than her 
After spending last week promoting her upcoming feature Pad Man, Sonam Kapoor was recently spotted attending the IWC Schaffhausen event in Geneva, Switzerland. In a perfect example of monochrome dressing, Kapoor channelled top-to-bottom dusky rose separates by Bouguessa. The actor's look consisted of a double-breasted blazer paired with culottes and a long coat that added structure to her look.

Sonam Kapoor aces two pink looks in less than 24 hours 
With her red Marni earrings and burgundy Stuart Weitzman boots (and a matching lip colour), the actor eased the pink monotony without straying from the palette. She finished with an IWC Schaffhausen gold watch and kept the rest of her beauty look simple, with shimmery eye shadow, sleek eye liner and poker straight hair. 
For her second look too, the actor went with a similar colour story, choosing a flamingo hued off-shoulder gown from Viktor & Rolf's recent collection. The lower part of the gown featured heavy, asymmetric layers of ruffled tulle, adding drama to her ensemble without the need of embellishment. Kapoor punctuated her look once again with IWC Schaffhausen gold watch, but this time, stuck to metallic accents with silver earrings and multiple rings by Repossi. Her makeup consisted of dark smoky eyes juxtaposed with pink lips and blush, and hair tied back in a neat bun. 
Kapoor's recent looks were all about unlikely ways to make a statement. Power dressing for a work event? Pick a single, strong hue and go all out with it. Have a cocktail evening? Choose dramatic detailing on your gown over heavy embellishments. Scroll through our gallery for a closer look at Sonam Kapoor's looks from yesterday.

Here’s a sneak peek 
The awards season has officially begun, and if you hear closely, you can all but hear the rustle of tulle gowns and the genteel clink of prized diamonds. Having graced the likes of Nicole Kidman and Halle Berry at the revered Academy Awards, Forevermark is in the midst of yet another extravaganza for its annual Red Carpet Collection for the Oscars. We caught up with Federica Imperiali, head of new product development, to give us the lowdown on what to watch out for, the jewellery trends that will rule the year and how to style the exquisite pieces once you get your hands on them.

These are the diamonds you will see on the Oscars 2018 red carpet 
What can we expect on the Academy Awards red carpet this year from Forevermark? This year, we have sought inspiration from the Garden of Wonders, drawing upon specific colours and the personality that they express, from the yellow mimosa to the red poppy flower and the green ivy. In terms of silhouette, we have imagined the ivy as a choker, that a lot of celebrities have selected, and cuff earrings with a twist. You'll find a shorter motif that can be worn as asymmetrical earrings with its longer counterpart. The different stones of the cuff have been bestowed with different cuts to bring about a fluidity in the design, so that it moves with the wearer. 
How would you recommend that these earcuffs be styled? Of course, on the red carpet, the objective is to make the most of the limelight, so I would suggest that the hair be pulled back or tied up in a slick updo. But for everyday use, even if you have your hair down and just a glimpse of the earrings showing through, it adds an element of intrigue each time you naturally flip your hair back. Also, considering the mismatched style, you can create a similar asymmetric hairstyle with the hair taken behind on one side, and cascading down on the other. 
What are the key elements that you keep in mind when designing a collection for the red carpet? We generally find that chokers and earrings are in greater demand than bracelets and rings. Also, hair accessories like studded pins are really popular these days. The most important fact is that while designing the pieces, we don't know in advance what the chosen outfit will be and what will be style of its wearer. Which is why we allow room in our designs for diversity and add a classic touch to the jewellery to make it universal. While we want all eyes on our jewels, it is also important to ensure that they don't overwhelm the personality of the lady wearing them. We have always strived to provide a touch of assurance and comfort to the wearer in terms of the weight—some might even forget that they've put on an elaborate piece! 
As a designer, where does the creative process begin when working on a new collection? A good place to begin is to consider the emotion that you are trying to bring to life and to then conceptualise it within the structure of the piece, and the positioning and shape of the key diamond. 
Which celebrity do you think wears her diamonds the best? The best part about diamond jewellery is that it is universal in terms of adapting to the style of the wearer. However, when it comes to personality, I definitely feel Emma Watson makes a strong statement with her jewellery choices. As a person, she projects a strong image and is extremely driven by her cause of empowering women, which is something that we, as a brand, are also committed to. 
How should one choose a piece of jewellery depending on their personality? First, I always advise that any form of jewellery should enhance, rather than overpower, your individual personality. Also, the learning that we have had is to allow the consumer to express and put a little bit of themselves into the style. Our stackable jewellery allows the wearer to decide how to mix and match the piece and how to wear it depending on their creativity. 
What jewellery trends do you think will be big in 2018? Stackable is definitely going to dominate the charts. Going ahead of the usual suspects, we are proposing stackable earrings, necklaces and bracelets. You can choose to add or remove layers from the tiered necklace or play around with charms that symbolise different emotions. 
We are also really excited about our special mangalsutra offering which serves as the core inspiration for our transformative stackable jewellery in India. Just like the wedding band, it is meant to be worn all the time but the younger crowd may not find it versatile for their daily wardrobe. In keeping with the tradition and the role that it plays, we have designed a mangalsutra that can be worn in eight different ways, from the signature piece with the black beads, or as a detachable solitaire that can serve as a standalone pendant or perhaps as a bracelet with additional charms. 
What are the common mistakes that women make today when styling their diamond accessories? It is essential to keep in mind the kind of dress that goes with a statement piece of jewellery; the two should complement each other to present a cohesive look. The more articulate and elaborate the jewellery is, the more minimal the dress needs to be. The key here is to avoid the ‘Christmas tree' approach of stacking on multiple baubles vying for attention. I have always believed that for an informal occasion, a pair of jeans and a basic white T-shirt with some classic diamond trinkets are fail-safe. Stud earrings are the safe choice, but you may want to loop in some chandelier earrings. The end result shouldn't look as though as it has been overtly worked on; a simple chignon and a pair of mismatched earrings will do the job just as well. Also, the kind of makeup you opt for can make or break the look. The bigger the earrings, the less invasive the face should be. 
How should you decide on a neckpiece depending on the kind of neckline that you're wearing? You can simply play around with the size adjustment if you're wearing a boat-necked dress or even a plunging neckline. It is a common misconception that you can't wear a neckpiece with a high-necked dress. If you have an unembellished neckline, you can always layer a choker on your high-necked outfits and integrate it into your dress itself.

Which one would you pick? 
If you needed a push to flaunt that dramatic sequinned number in your wardrobe, Sridevi offers inspiration with two distinct, high shine looks. The actor was spotted recently at the Umang Police Show with her husband Boney Kapoor, after which she attended Zee Entertainment Enterprises's 25th anniversary party in Mumbai.

Single Celeb Sridevi 
For the Umang Police Show, the actor opted for an ivory high-shine anarkali and matching dupatta featuring sequin work by Falguni Shane Peacock. Accessorising her look with a shimmery clutch, diamond and emerald green earrings by Begani Jewels, the actor tied the look together with heavily kohled eyes, glossy lips, braided bun and oxblood nails. 
For the Zee anniversary party, Sridevi stuck to the ivory colour palette but switched it up with a shimmery jumpsuit also by Falguni Shane Peacock. While the sleek belt of the jumpsuit accentuated her silhouette, the plunging neckline and the flared sleeves made it perfect for a cocktail party. The actor accessorised her look with a clutch, sleek diamond and matching earrings by Heeramaneck and Son. To keep the focus on her outfit, the actor went with glossy lips, shimmery eyeshadow, sleek eyeliner and mascara. 
Whether you're looking to swap usual colour palette of pinks and red at a sangeet ceremony or make an impact at a cocktail event, Sridevi's looks serve as perfect inspiration. Scroll through our gallery to get a closer look at both the ensembles in our slideshow.

Deepika Padukone  sure had a busy weekend, attending Umang, Zee's 25th anniversary party, Kajal Anand's birthday and hitting the airport. The actor stepped out in three different looks for the occasions—a sari by Sabyasachi, a velvet blazer and jeans and an airport look featuring leather pants and a Gucci bum bag.

Deepika padukone’s embroidered blouse needs to be a part of your ethnic wardrobe 
For Umang and Zee's anniversary party, the actor opted for a black organza sari by one of her favourite designers, Sabyasachi. The otherwise minimal sari was accentuated with a black full-sleeve embroidered blouse that lent a dash of shine to Padukone's look. If you were looking for ways to elevate a simple sari, the actor's choice of blouse demonstrates that a little detailing can go a long way. 
Adding colour to her all-black look, Padukone accessorised her outfit with sleek diamond and emerald earrings. The star added finishing touches to the ensemble by way of nude lips, dewy make-up and mascara, with her hair tied up in a neat bun. 
Her other sartorial choices for the weekend included a velvet Sandro Paris blazer-top paired with Topshop jeans for Kajal Anand's birthday, and a striped shirt worn with leather pants and accessorised with a Gucci bag and ankle boots for her trip to the airport.

Wedding-ready anarkalis, dreamy evening gowns and more 
This weekend, Bollywood's calendar was choc-a-block with events. At 2018's edition of the Umang Police Show, stars went the traditional route with their wardrobes. While Anushka Sharma, Sridevi and Alia Bhatt attended in semi-sheer ivory Indian ethnic looks (the first in a Manish Malhotra anarkali, the second in a Falguni Shane Peacock creation and the third in an Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla kurta set), Kangana Ranaut made a statement in her emerald green sari, and Shilpa Shetty Kundra looked elegant in her metallic Kiran Uttam Ghosh ensemble.

The evening of January 13 also had Zee Entertainment Enterprises celebrating its 25th anniversary in Mumbai. Post the Umang Police Show, Deepika Padukone stopped by in a slinky Sabyasachi sari, and both, Sridevi and Ranaut swapped their festive looks for Western silhouettes. We spotted Sridevi in a Falguni Shane Peacock jumpsuit and Ranaut in her second ivory look for the night: a frothy Galia Lahav gown. 
And that's not where the outings ended. This weekend also marked Kaajal Anand's 50th birthday, for which Shah Rukh Khan hosted a star-studded celebration at his residence, Mannat. Following the party's ‘Shimmer and Shine' theme, Kareena Kapoor Khan attended in a silver MSGM top, Karisma Kapoor partied in a sequinned Falguni Shane Peacock midi dress, Malaika Arora opted for a gold Manish Malhotra number, and Alia Bhatt joined in wearing an Atelier Zuhra gown featuring mirror work details. 
The star who had the busiest weekend, however, had to be Sonam Kapoor. The actor spent the last three days promoting Pad Man in everything from an Amit Aggarwal lehenga to a cosy grey sweatshirt and that butterfly-inspired Kojak Studio shirt. Check out each look in our slideshow now.

“For too long, women have not been heard” 
Each year, the Golden Globe awards top trending charts all over the world. And this time around, the annual event hasn't just had people talking because of its star-studded guest list. The 75th edition of the award ceremony made headlines when it became a platform for Hollywood's most renowned faces to take a stand against sexual harassment. In response to the Harvey Weinstein scandal, stars walked the red carpet dressed in all-black ensembles this Sunday. 
2018's Golden Globes also marked a huge milestone for Oprah Winfrey, making her the first African-American woman to win the Cecil B. DeMille Award, an honorary Golden Globe Award given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for "outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment". 
In true Winfrey style, the 63-year-old icon took the stage with an empowering speech that's already taken over the internet and is a must-watch for women all over the world. 
Winfrey used her win to shed light not just on abuse and the #MeToo movement, but racism and sexism as well, closing her speech with “I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight.” Her speech will be the most powerful thing you read today. 
Ah! Thank you. Thank you all. Okay, okay. Thank you, Reese. In 1964, I was a little girl sitting on the linoleum floor of my mother's house in Milwaukee, watching Anne Bancroft present the Oscar for best actor at the 36th Academy Awards. She opened the envelope and said five words that literally made history: “The winner is Sidney Poitier.” Up to the stage came the most elegant man I had ever seen. I remember his tie was white, and of course his skin was black. And I'd never seen a black man being celebrated like that. And I've tried many, many times to explain what a moment like that means to a little girl — a kid watching from the cheap seats, as my mom came through the door bone-tired from cleaning other people's houses. All I can do is quote and say that the explanation's in Sidney's performance in “Lillies of the Field”: “Amen, amen. Amen, amen.” In 1982, Sidney received the Cecil B. DeMille Award right here at the Golden Globes, and it is not lost on me that at this moment there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given this same award. 
It is an honor, and it is a privilege to share the evening with all of them, and also with the incredible men and women who inspired me, who challenged me, who sustained me and made my journey to this stage possible. Dennis Swanson, who took a chance on me for “A.M. Chicago”; Quincy Jones, who saw me on that show and said to Steven Spielberg, “Yes, she is Sophia in ‘The Color Purple'”; Gayle, who's been the definition of what a friend is; and Stedman, who's been my rock—just a few to name. I'd like to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, because we all know that the press is under siege these days. 
But we also know that it is the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice. To tyrants and victims and secrets and lies. I want to say that I value the press more than ever before, as we try to navigate these complicated times. Which brings me to this: What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. And I'm especially proud and inspired by all of the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories. Each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories that we tell. This year we became the story. But it's not just a story affecting the entertainment industry. It's one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics or workplace. 
So I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault, because they—like my mother—had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They're the women whose names we'll never know. They are domestic workers and farm workers; they are working in factories and they work in restaurants, and they're in academia and engineering and medicine and science; they're part of the world of tech and politics and business; they're our athletes in the Olympics and they're our soldiers in the military. 
And they're someone else: Recy Taylor, a name I know and I think you should know, too. In 1944, Recy Taylor was a young wife and a mother. She was just walking home from a church service she'd attended in Abbeville, Ala., when she was abducted by six armed white men, raped, and left blindfolded by the side of the road, coming home from church. They threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone, but her story was reported to the N.A.A.C.P., where a young worker by the name of Rosa Parks became the lead investigator on her case and together they sought justice. But justice wasn't an option in the era of Jim Crow. The men who tried to destroy her were never persecuted. Recy Taylor died 10 days ago, just shy of her 98th birthday. She lived, as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. And for too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up. Their time is up. 
And I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing that her truth—like the truth of so many other women who were tormented in those years, and even now tormented—goes marching on. It was somewhere in Rosa Parks's heart almost 11 years later, when she made the decision to stay seated on that bus in Montgomery. And it's here with every woman who chooses to say, “Me too.” And every man—every man—who chooses to listen. In my career, what I've always tried my best to do, whether on television or through film, is to say something about how men and women really behave: to say how we experience shame, how we love and how we rage, how we fail, how we retreat, persevere, and how we overcome. And I've interviewed and portrayed people who've withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you, but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning—even during our darkest nights. 
So I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, ‘Me too,' again. Thank you.”

Plus, how Sonam Kapoor, Akshay Kumar and others wished the star 
This January 10, Hrithik Roshan turned 44 years old. And just like last year, the actor celebrated his birthday with his closest family and friends, including Sonali Bendre Behl, Zayed Khan, Kunal Kapoor, Naina Bachchan and ex-wife Sussanne Khan. 
What made Roshan's birthday even more special was the social media post Khan shared to wish the star on his big day. 
In case you missed it, Khan shared an adorable party picture of herself with Roshan to bring in his birthday in 2017 as well. This year, the interior design pro put up an unseen holiday snapshot with Roshan to celebrate his birthday. The caption of the duo's latest snapshot couldn't have been sweeter. “Forever and always you stay the sunshine in my life,” Khan said. “Happy happiest birthday… Smile that smile brightest and you always will spread that light...limitless #sacredheart.” 
Captured against a snowy backdrop, the selfie is rumoured to have been shot at a recent family vacation the ex-couple took in December. Khan and Roshan brought in the new year with their sons Hrehaan and Hridhaan Roshan at Rhône-Alps, France, spending their days skiing and enjoying breathtaking views. 
While Roshan spent a part of his birthday meeting fans and the media, his best Bollywood friends joined Khan in wishing him online. From Akshay Kumar and Shilpa Shetty Kundra to Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai co-star Ameesha Patel and Sonam Kapoor, check out how the stars wished Roshan a happy birthday.

Black is back 
In the light of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the ousting of other sexual predators in Hollywood and the world across, the stars knew that walking into an awards ceremony without acknowledging it would not be possible. This gave rise to #TimesUp, an initiative that had women wearing black on Sunday as a sign of solidarity for the victims. Naturally, this translated onto the red carpet of the Golden Globes 2018, where both men and women chose the somber hue to make a mark. 
One can never go wrong with black, and the colour of choice translated effortlessly onto the red carpet this year. From Claire Foy's sharp Stella McCartney pantsuit to Dakota Jonson's Gucci gown with a dazzling cape, celebrities made a strong statement with their sartorial choices. Amongst the mini trends that emerged from the evening were the plunging neckline, seen on Catherine Zeta-Jones, Emilia Clarke, Eva Longoria and others. 
Velvet was the favoured fabric of the night—Viola Davis and Natalie Portman were spotted working the luxe look. Adding a touch of sexy to black with sheer dresses were Diane Kruger, Sarah Jessica Parker and Sharon Stone. Meanwhile, Michelle Pfeiffer, Gal Gadot and America Ferrera made a case for structured blazers worn over dresses. 
The men were also seen supporting #WhyWeWearBlack in tuxedos. Zac Efron and Nick Jonas took the look a notch above by going with all-black suits. Scroll through our gallery to see what every stars wore at the Golden Globes 2018.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Aaradhya Bachchan twin at the airport again 
Whether the superstar is walking the red carpet at Cannes, hoisting the Indian flag in Australia, celebrating at a wedding or paying her respects during Durga Puja, Rai Bachchan loves enjoying every event with her six-year-old. In fact, the mother-daughter duo are so close, they often like to co-ordinate their outfits too. 
After twinning in tulle gowns just months ago (did you miss all the star-studded pictures from Aaradhya's latest birthday celebrations?), the Bachchan women stepped out in matching looks once again this weekend. This time around, Aishwarya and Aaradhya skipped on frilly, feminine gowns for matching jerseys worn with comfortable skinny jeans. The bright blue jerseys belong to Abhishek Bachchan's football team, the Chennaiyin FC. 
What set each of their OOTDs apart? While Aaradhya wore her look with white Adidas sneakers and a matching white hairband, mom Aishwarya added a pop to her look with gold Nike kicks and a studded maroon Christian Louboutin bag. The coolest detail of all from the duo's latest style moment: the backs of their jerseys, both customised with their names.

10 best celebrity beauty looks from the Golden Globes 2018 
Let's begin with the plain fact that the Golden Globes has set (and raised the level of) our beauty mood board for 2018—at least for every time we pick ‘black' as our sartorial go-to. The award season kicked off powerfully with the theme of the Golden Globes circling around an important cultural movement—Time's Up—for which the stars wore black in solidarity to spread the message of gender equality and the obliteration of sexual harassment. While the clothes manifested this cohesive message strongly, the beauty artists didn't hold back on their inventiveness and creativity to ‘break the black code'. This is how they did it right. 
Riot of colours Offsetting the style code was a riot of colours everywhere—almost like a parallel message of breaking boundaries and setting free your inhibitions—juxtaposing the black. Bold bright lips—from fuchsia and magenta to poppy red and tangerine—were the statement choice for Jessica Chastain, Margot Robbie, Emma Watson and many others. The colours didn't just stay on the lips. Kerry Washington picked a glittery purple to line her peepers, Penelope Cruz chose a shining copper to match her hazel eyes, and Emma Stone smoked-out her eyes with an intense teal. 
Hair-raisers Millie Bobby Brown made the Generations Zs proud and styled her buzz-cut with an unconventional, and pretty powerful, back-braided top knot. This, with a precise matte-black cat-eye, clean face and baby lips, is a memory that will stay with us for a long time. Everyone had every reason to love Viola Davis' big, wild curls that she wasn't afraid to flaunt and set free. And those vintage Hollywood waves—whether done ‘undone' in a lose updo like Nicole Kidman or swept on the side like Margot Robbie and Jessica Chastain—will always remain a timeless favourite. Here's a look at the best beauty moments at the Golden Globes 2018.

Ahead of the all-black dress code planned for Sunday’s Golden Globes, Vogue looks back at the history of women’s protest, the role of fashion in politics and the power of wearing persistence on your sleeve… 
Award shows are, traditionally speaking, a stage — a stage upon which a moment of fashion fantasy plays out, where talent is celebrated, and where stars can make a statement and have their voices heard. At the Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday — the first major Hollywood awards ceremony of the year — a number of high-profile women are planning to make a powerful statement against sexual harassment in the entertainment industry. And they're doing it via the colour of their clothes.

Back to black: Why women are using clothing to protest at the Golden Globes 
In a show of solidarity following the allegations of rape and sexual assault made against the American film producer Harvey Weinstein late last year, 300 actresses, agents, writers, directors and producers – including Emma Stone, Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Shonda Rhimes – have called on women attending the awards on Sunday to don black. They also published an open letter in the New York Times announcing the launch of Time's Up, which includes a $13 million legal fund to support survivors of sexual assault and harassment in the workplace. 
“This is a moment of solidarity,” Eva Longoria told the Times of the protest. “This time the industry can't expect us to go up and twirl around.” 
The resulting images — showing dozens of the world's most famous celebrities clothed uniformly in black, splashed on the front pages of newspapers across the globe — will be striking. “Think how important actresses wearing elaborate, bright dresses is to so many forms of media now,” says Rebecca Arnold, senior lecturer in History of Dress & Textiles at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. “Subtracting that, and refusing that, is a really strong protest. It will force all those magazines who cover what was worn at the Golden Globes—who looks good and who doesn't look good—to engage.” 
The blackout has sparked something of a dress race, with stylists like Karla Welch, Jessica Paster, Law Roach and Tanya Gill rushing to secure a handful of dresses. Designers are also quickly remaking dresses in black — Prabal Gurung, Christian Siriano and Naeem Khan included — while battling a major storm New York. 
Using colour as protest 
Sunday's initiative builds on a growing movement of (sartorial) dissent on the red carpet. Lola Kirke and Transparent creator Jill Soloway sported “Fuck Paul Ryan” badges to the 2017 Golden Globes; Kerry Washington wore a safety pin at the 2017 SAG awards in support of refugees denied entry to the U.S.; and several attendees of to the 2017 Oscars ceremony, including Ruth Negga and Karlie Kloss, pinned blue American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ribbons to their dresses to draw awareness to the non-profit's work. But this year's Globes protest marks a watershed moment in the unification and organisation of a red-carpet resistance. 
The Golden Globes protest undoubtedly takes its biggest steer from the Suffragette movement of the early 20th century, when women donned white, green and purple to advocate for the vote. White has since evolved into a symbol of feminist resistance all its own. It was worn by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to President Donald Trump's inauguration, by female Democrats to his first joint address to Congress, and by those protesting his return to New York after his swearing in. 
In January of last year, another item of clothing — the pink pussyhat — became a feminist symbol after women around the world marched in protest of Trump. (The pussyhat referenced a recorded comment he had made about grabbing women by the genitals.) Other recent political initiatives in the U.S. have likewise utilised colour to great effect, like the Wear Orange movement to spotlight gun violence. 
The power of black 
So why have this year's Golden Globe nominees chosen black over white or pink? “Black is a really powerful colour to use: it's a non-colour,” says Arnold. “It matches with menswear, making an equivalence and flatting out some of the differences.” It is also the colour of power, mourning, and ultimately darkness, as Margaret Atwood highlights in her dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale. 
Sunday's all-black dress code hasn't gone without criticism. Actress Rose McGowan, one of the first to go public with claims against Weinstein, was quick to point out that wearing black is a “silent” protest, tweeting at the time: “You'll accept a face award breathlessly and affect no real change… Your silence is the problem.” 
When all is said and done, the stand taken at the Golden Globes will be remembered long after the stars have shed their black ensembles, sparking — as intended — ever-larger conversations about women's rights around the world.

Have you been keeping up with the mother-daughter duo?

The cutest pictures from Misha Kapoor’s park date with Mira Rajput Kapoor 
As the first week of January comes to a close, Bollywood fans can't stop talking about the latest pictures of Mira and Misha to hit the internet. The much-followed mother-daughter duo was spotted enjoying an evening at a Mumbai park together yesterday. 
Dressed in printed pink leggings and a beige cardigan, little Misha enjoyed her time in the playground with rides on a yellow slide, and made a few friends while she was at it. Mom Mira looked on in one of her most comfortable looks this winter: a simple royal blue jumper worn with cropped black jeans, a pair of sunglasses and silver flats. The Kapoor women ended their outing with a little snack for Misha (did you notice her Minnie Mouse-themed bib?), and a few minutes spent watching the ducks housed in the park with the other parents. Though Shahid did not join in for the evening, the actor was seen accompanying Mira at the gym earlier the same day. Catch up on all the pictures via our slideshow.

Nominees, dresses and more 
The beginning of the year heralds the awards season starting with the 75th Golden Globes. Will Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone make it to the ceremony? Given that Chopra's series Quantico is into the third season, chances that you might see the star are high. Unlike the usual fanfare of decadent gowns that you would otherwise expect on the red carpet, in the light of the sexual harassment revelations in Hollywood, actresses will be wearing black gowns as a sign of protest. 
One of the most talked about movies this year was The Shape of Water, by Spanish filmmaker Guillermo del Toro which earned no less than seven nominations. HBO mini-series Big Little Lies starring Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon has garnered six nominations. Will you be keeping up with the globes as the ceremony unfolds? Vogue recaps everything you need to know about Golden Globes 2018. 
When is the Golden Globes ceremony happening? The 75th Golden Globes ceremony will take place on January 8, 2018 at 6:30 am. 
Where is it? The Golden Globe Awards ceremony will be hosted at the Beverly Hilton hotel, in Beverly Hills, California. 
Where can I watch it? Follow it on Vogue India's Instagram. 
Who is hosting? The American comedian and television host, Seth Meyers, who is the star of his own late-night talk show on NBC, Late Night with Seth Meyers, is set to host the events. He carries the baton passed to him by fellow talk show host Jimmy Fallon, who hosted the 74th edition of the event last year.

The list includes Selena Gomez, Reese Witherspoon and Margot Robbie among others 
“The clock has run out on sexual assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace. It's time to do something about it.” This is first the statement visible on the Time's Up homepage, which launched on January 1, 2018. The website has been set up as a call for change by women in Hollywood for women in all industries. Over 300 women in film, television and theatre posted a Letter of Solidarity and are calling for signatures. They are also calling for donations to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which will be used to subsidise legal support for anyone who has experience workplace sexual harassment, assault and/or abuse in the US. 
Explaining their mission in the Letter of Solidarity, the group, which includes Selena Gomez, Reese Witherspoon and Margot Robbie writes: “We want all survivors of sexual harassment, everywhere, to be heard, to be believed, and to know that accountability is possible. We also want all victims and survivors to be able to access justice and support for the wrongdoing they have endured. We particularly want to lift up the voices, power, and strength of women working in low-wage industries where the lack of financial stability makes them vulnerable to high rates of gender-based violence and exploitation.” 
“We call for a significant increase of women in positions of leadership and power across industries,” the letter continues. “In addition, we seek equal representation, opportunities, benefits and pay for all women workers, not to mention greater representation of women of color, immigrant women, and lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women, whose experiences in the workforce are often significantly worse than their white, cisgender, straight peers.” 
The letter has also been published in the New York Times and La Opinion, a Spanish-language newspaper, as full page ads. 
Other names to have already signed the letter include Dakota Johnson, Emma Stone, Natalie Portman, Eva Longoria, Shonda Rhimes, Ashley Judd, and America Ferrera.

Selfies, dance-offs and so much more 
December 26 was a big day for Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli. After a hush-hush wedding in the heart of Tuscany, and a mini honeymoon in the icy depths of Europe, the newly-weds returned to India just in time for their Delhi reception on December 21, and then flew back to Mumbai for their last wedding reception, which took place last night.

The top unseen moments from Virat Kohli & Anushka Sharma’s Mumbai reception 
In case you missed it, #Virushka's big night was attended by some of Bollywood's most loved celebrities, including Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Amitabh Bachchan. While the red carpet was definitely unmissable (can you pick just one lehenga for your Pinterest board?), what trumped the picture-perfect snapshots from outside the venue were the unseen, candid moments from inside the celebration. 
While Mr Bachchan greeted the new bride with a heartfelt namaste, Kohli was in splits when he met Abhishek Bachchan. Kangana Ranaut made sure to give Rekha a kiss for the cameras, and the cutest guest of all, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's daughter Ziva, couldn't stop waving at the shutterbugs. Later in the night, Ranbir Kapoor got himself a hilarious bromance snapshot with Kohli, Yuvraj Singh showed us all his dance moves alongside Harbhajan Singh, and Shah Rukh Khan jumped onto the dance floor the second "Chaiyya Chaiyya" began playing at the after-party. Catch up on all the excitement now.

How stunning does she look! 
Amongst the glittering list of Bollywood stars at Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's wedding reception was Shweta Bachchan Nanda with father Amitabh Bachchan by her side. The columnisy went with a pale pink sari by couture label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla for the occasion. While most prefer embellished lehengas or a gowns for evening receptions, Bachchan Nanda made a case for the humble yet ultra glamorous sheer sari with a knockout blouse.

Shweta Bachchan Nanda’s designer sari is the ultimate wedding multitasker 
As is Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla's signature, the sari featured chikankari threadwork. The semi sheer blouse elevated the otherwise simple sari by way of the pearl and 3D scalloped detailing. When it came to accessories, the writer chose a pair of diamond dangers, a bindi and a simple bracelet. Bachchan Nanda maintained understated elegance and went with blow-dried hair and nude makeup. 
Amitabh Bachchan posed for the paparazzi with his daughter in tow. She was also accompanied by her brother Abhishek Bachchan and sister-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan for the occasion. 
If you love understated glamour but want to stay away from all the rhinestones and diamantes for your next wedding do, take a cue from Shweta Bachchan Nanda's style book and pack a sheer sari in your bag. 
Take a closer look at Shweta Bachchan Nanda's look from Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's wedding reception.

Inside Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s star-studded Mumbai reception 
Earlier this December, Bollywood star Anushka Sharma and cricket pro Virat Kohli gave Bollywood and sports fans all over India quite the surprise. The duo, who have been rumoured to be together for years now, flew to Tuscany with their families, and tied the knot amongst their nearest and dearest in a quiet, very romantic ceremony. 
Days after their special day, the couple took a few days off with a mini honeymoon, and then returned to India to kick start their bigger celebrations. On December 21, the newly-weds came together in Delhi for their first wedding reception (attended by the likes of PM Narendra Modi, Gautam Gambhir and Shikhar Dhawan), and tonight, the duo celebrated their wedding with their second and last reception in Mumbai. 
Held at Mumbai's St Regis Hotel, #Virushka's reception will likely boasted a star-studded guest list. Even though it's early considering Bollywood time, a few from the sports fraternity and celebrities like Boman Irani, Sara Ali Khan, have been spotted arriving already. 
After picking a traditional red Benarasi sari in Delhi days ago, the bride picked a golden embellished lehenga by Sabyasachi for this occasion, while the groom was seen wearing a dark bandhgala. Not unlike the couple's wedding in Tuscany, flowers took precedence in the decor, which has been described as an "Enchanted Forest". More updates on the wedding to follow.

Hand-beaten silver thread, textured sequins and organza flowers

Sabyasachi on how he created Anushka Sharma’s Mumbai reception lehenga 
After having worn a blush lehenga, a pop hued one and two saris before, Sharma went with a classic choice for her reception. The star chose a strappy blouse with an embellished lehenga skirt, and a belted dupatta for the occasion. Hand-beaten silver thread, textured sequins and organza flowers were used to bring life to the creation. 
“For her Mumbai reception, Anushka wanted to wear old-world glamour. And we decided to ‘Jazz' it up in smoky grey. Award winning master craftsmen from Lucknow rendered her stunning dupatta which was clinched on the waist with our ‘Bengal tiger' belt. Anushka's look was accessorised with a necklace and earrings hand crafted with rose cut diamonds, solitaires and briolettes from the Sabyasachi Fine Jewelry collection,” said the designer. The star continued to wear the traditional red chuda for the evening, and paired her outfit with sculpted waves courtesy hairstylist Gabriel Georgiou, and soft brown eyes, nude lips and a hint of blush courtesy makeup artist Subbu. 
Meanwhile, Virat Kohli complemented the star in a navy bandhgala in velvet by Raghavendra Rathore. Here's a closer look at the radiant couple from their reception. 
Here's a glimpse at the after party following the reception.

Bollywood Christmas 2017 
After Diwali this October, Bollywood got a chance to come together once again over the weekend for Christmas. And in true Bollywood style, the stars celebrated the festival in the grandest of ways. 
Bringing in the big day, Karan Johar hosted a house party that was attended by everyone from Navya Naveli Nanda and Aryan Khan to Alia Bhatt and Natasha Poonawalla. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan enjoyed a romantic dinner date with husband Abhishek Bachchan, and Kareena Kapoor Khan invited Sara Ali Khan and Soha Ali Khan Pataudi over for a pre-Christmas dinner. 
And the celebrations didn't end there. Christmas Day had everyone talking about Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, who spent the occasion hanging out with uncle Ranbir Kapoor, and both Jacqueline Fernandez and Varun Dhawan made sure to spread some cheer around Mumbai by hanging out with underprivileged kids. Away from home, Deepika Padukone attended her very first midnight mass, Sonam Kapoor strolled through the streets of England with Anand Ahuja, and Sussanne Khan enjoyed a quiet vacation with her sons. Catch up on all the Christmas madness now.

Anushka Sharma & Virat Kohli’s first dance as a married couple is adorable 
The last leg of the Virushka wedding celebrations will take place tonight as Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma will host their friends and family in Mumbai. Thus far, the duo have managed to keep all information about the logistics under wraps—even then, here's what we could find out about the big party tonight. 
Sharma and Kohli will be dressed in Sabyasachi couture. Their wardrobe history so far suggests that the actor and captain of the Indian national cricket team will go with Sabyasachi Mukherjee's work, which they have favoured for all of their wedding events until now. Since Sharma has already been seen in a sari at the reception in New Delhi, we are hoping to see the star in a decadent lehenga or a gown. 
Tonight's event will be hosted at the St. Regis hotel in Lower Parel—avoid taking the route to save yourself from getting stuck in heavy traffic. The Astor Ballroom in the hotel is where the duo will be hosting their guests. 
Speaking of who is invited to the high-profile event—one can expect all of Bollywood to be present to congratulate the happy couple. Members of the Indian national cricket team will also be there to show their support. Will Ranbir Kapoor be there? Our guess is a yes. 
Given Sharma and Kohli's proclivity for breaking into dances, band or no band, the couple is sure to keep the audience entertained at the reception. With more dancers in the house, you can only expect the revelry to go on until the wee hours of the morning. 
The shutterbugs will have a field day getting all the right pictures from the event. Stay glued to your phones for viral videos that guests are sure to post from inside the reception to get a true look and feel of the evening. While you wait for those, check out our slideshow for all the candid moments from their Delhi reception last week.

Inside Taimur Ali Khan’s Christmas with Kareena Kapoor Khan & Ranbir Kapoor 
December is turning out to be a blast for Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. Just last week, the toddler turned one at the Pataudi Palace. And incase you missed it, his first birthday celebration was unlike most, featuring quiet horse rides, vintage carousels, colourful trains and even a three-tiered jungle-themed cake. 
After all that excitement, Taimur returned to Mumbai with his parents just in time for the Kapoor family's Christmas celebrations. The whole family came together this Sunday for an afternoon together, and Taimur's pictures from the lunch are too cute to miss. 
Dressed in a festive jumper featuring a snowman, Taimur entered the lunch hand in hand with his parents, and his afternoon included bhangra lessons from uncle Aadar Jain, some quiet time spent enjoying the view with uncle Ranbir Kapoor, and lots of pictures with cousins Kiaan Raj and Samaira Kapur. The cutest moment from the lunch, however, had to be the video of Taimur trying on a pair of sunglasses for the family. Have you checked out his adorable reaction to all the attention yet?

Anushka Sharma & Virat Kohli’s first dance as a married couple is adorable 
You've seen the outfits, you've seen the venue, and you've seen the picture-perfect poses from Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's grand wedding reception in Delhi on December 21. But if you haven't checked out the candid images and videos of the couple from the evening, you're really missing out. 
Instagram is booming with unseen moments from #Virushka's special day, and they are too cute to miss. Some of our favourites: The moment PM Narendra Modi greeted the newly-weds with a namaste and a red rose each, the picture of a toddler napping in Sharma's lap, and Kohli's ecstatic expression in Shikhar Dhawan's selfie. 
The best of the best, however, have to be the videos of Sharma and Kohli dancing in front of their guests for what may be the very first time as a married couple. While the bride was seen busting a bhangra move in that regal Benarasi Sabyasachi with a note in her mouth, the groom put on a special performance just for her in the middle of the night. And when they hit the dance floor together hand-in-hand, all eyes were on them. If the Delhi get-together was this action-packed, one can only imagine how eventful the duo's upcoming Mumbai celebration be.

What we loved 
After their stunning Tuscan wedding, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli are back in India and hosted their first of two receptions in Delhi last night. Both Kohli and Sharma were dressed in outfits by Sabayasachi, as they have been for their previous functions with Puneet B Saini on makeup and Gabriel Georgiou on hair for the actor. Sharma maintained her beauty aesthetic from her wedding in Italy by accentuating her eyes and working with florals in her hair. 
For Sharma, Saini opted for classic bridal makeup. “The look was not only beautiful, it was specifically traditional with loads of kohl, a soft mouth and a red bindi,” said the makeup artist. She kept Sharma's skin clean, with just a hint of bronzer and matte, nude lips. She played up her eyes for the function by wearing brown eyeshadow on her lower lash liner and over her lid till the crease. She then lined both her lids with soft black kohl and finished off her look with multiple coats of mascara. 
For her hair, "the inspiration was classic chic, more regal," says Georgiou. Sharma ditched the extravagant dos yet again and opted for a middle part and simple low bun that was adorned by strings of mogras. Her hairstyle was complete with some wet-look gel to set the hair and sindoor. The couple is already in Mumbai for their second reception for friends from the cricket and Bollywood fraternities on December 26 at the St. Regis in Lower Parel.

Here's what the designer had to say about the actor's wedding look

Anushka Sharma’s Sabyasachi sari for her reception is one for the books 
In case you missed it, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli hosted a reception for their friends and families in New Delhi's Taj Diplomatic Enclave yesterday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was there to congratulate the happy couple. 
The bride and groom unsurprisingly went with label Sabyasachi for the reception as they did with all their previous ceremonies for the wedding. While everyone expected Sharma to be seen in a signature lehenga, the actor threw a curveball and instead arrived in a vermilion brocade sari by the label. Allia Al Rufai, Sharma's long-term stylist, said that the star wanted to go all-out traditional with the reception outfit. Sharma wore her chuda—the traditional bangles worn by North Indian brides and the sindoor with obvious pride. "Sabyasachi really managed to bring her vision to life, " she said. 
According to the designer, “I don't think Indian brides feel complete without wearing the colour red in one of their functions. Anushka decided to wear red on her reception. And much to my absolute delight, it would be a red Benarasi saree. The red bindi, the sindoor and the mogras in her hair just made the look more potent and powerful,” he said. The star also wore a heritage uncut diamond choker and jhumkas from the Sabyasachi Bridal Jewelry collection. 
Being fully aware of celebrity power, the designer both anticipates and hopes that versions of his sari will result in more business for the handloom sector.“Bollywood can play a major role in spreading awareness about Indian textiles and handlooms. And I must say the occasion couldn't be better. I know copies of this sari will flood the entire country in the next few months to come, which also means that a million weaver's children will be back at school. All I can say is thank you Anushka!" 
Comparing the star's persona as a bride versus an industry professional, Rufai added, "She was easier to work with as a bride. She was absolutely precise and clear about what she wanted. No bridezilla stories here. I have not seen a calmer composed self-assured bride before! But then that's Anushka for you." 
Meanwhile, Kohli complemented Sharma with a subtle look. The captain of the Indian cricket team wore black bandhgala with 18k gold buttons and a hand-embroidered antique pashmina shawl from Sabyasachi's ‘Kashmir Revival' project.

On December 20, Kareena Kapoor Khan and husband Saif Ali Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi celebrated his first birthday. And to bring in his big day, the Kapoor-Khan family went all out. 
Earlier this week, Kareena and Saif flew out of Mumbai with their toddler, and were joined at the Pataudi Palace just a day later by Karisma Kapoor, Babita Kapoor, and Kiaan Raj and Samaira Kapur. Building up to Taimur's birthday, the family came together for cosy bonfire nights, horse riding sessions and tractor rides. But few kids can compete with the birthday blowout Taimur was treated to yesterday. 
The baby nawab's day began with cuddles from aunt Karisma, and his party took place within a colourful play area complete with mini houses to climb into, a carousel, and a baby train. Taimur's parents added lots of baby blue balloons to the happy decor, and the birthday boy's three-tiered jungle-themed birthday cake deserves a special shout out. 
For his big day, one birthday outfit just wouldn't do. Taimur kickstarted his celebrations in a pristine white Ralph Lauren shirt, and then switched up his look post cutting his cake with a baby pink kurta, topped off with an ivory Nehru jacket. After Taimur's celebrations came to an end, the grown-ups got together with their closest crew including Shakeel and Amrita Arora Ladak and cousin Karan Kapoor for a relaxing evening of their own. Catch up on all the action via our slideshow.

Step inside Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli’s Delhi reception 
Ever since tying the knot in a secret ceremony on December 11 in Tuscany, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's fans have been keeping a close eye on the couple's moves. After returning from their mini-moon earlier this week, the newly-weds met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to invite him to their wedding reception in Delhi. 
Tonight, the duo is hosting a lavish wedding reception for their close family members and friends at the Taj Diplomatic Enclave in the capital, and the first pictures of the night are in. Continuing with their designer of choice, the couple made an entrance out in their sartorial best in looks by couturier Sabyasachi, who also put together their looks for the previous ceremonies. Anushka Sharma went the traditional route in a bright red and gold brocade sari—a change from the lehengas brides are known to opt from the label. The star complemented the sari with an opulent choker also by Sabyasachi's jewellery label. Virat Kohli on the other hand, chose a black bandhgala with a Kashmiri shawl featuring red accents, offering a contrast to Sharma's bright look. 
It's not over yet, as the couple will continue their wedding celebrations with another wedding reception at the St. Regis in Mumbai, next week on December 26, which is likely to be attended by Bollywood's A-listers. While you wait for Virushka's second reception in Maximum City, scroll through our slideshow to catch all the action from from their Delhi reception.

Anushka Sharma & Virat Kohli’s Delhi reception: All the venue details here 
Earlier this month, actor Anushka Sharma and cricketer Virat Kohli tied the knot with their closest friends and friends in Tuscany, Italy. After the dreamy nuptials and a brief "mini" moon, the couple is back in the country for the India leg of the celebrations. Kohli and Sharma are slated to host two grand receptions—one in Delhi on December 21 at the Taj Diplomatic Enclave and the other at the St. Regis in Mumbai, next week on December 26. 
Yesterday, Sharma and Kohli also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to present him with the invitation for the reception. Modi, who was seen congratulating the newly-weds, may attend the grand reception in the capital, later today. In case you haven't seen it yet, the invitation set was packaged in a beautiful, pastel, floral-print box with gold lettering, and contained a tiny sapling along with the invitation itself and some edible gifts. 
While the celebrations at the Taj Diplomatic Enclave, Delhi, is being slated as a family event, it may see famed Indian cricketers and other Delhi-based personalities in attendance. Set on a lush six acres, the stunning Taj property has a slew of venues such as Raja Bagh or the outdoor lawns, or Durbar, the sprawling 13,108sqft ballroom that will be ideal for the big reception. 
Since the couple wore stunning pieces by designer, Sabyasachi Mukerjee for previous functions of the weddings, it is likely that both Sharma and Kohli would be dressed by the couturier for the reception tonight too. Stay tuned for more updates from the event tonight.

From unmissable throwbacks from his heydays to adorable family pictures, Amitabh Bachchan often takes to his various social media accounts to share special moments with his fans.

How Bollywood is celebrating Taimur Ali Khan’s first birthday 
It seems like just yesterday that pictures of Saif Ali Khan giving wife Kareena Kapoor Khan a kiss at Breach Candy hospital hit the internet. But a year has swiftly gone by, and the couple's first child, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, turns a year old today. 
To celebrate Taimur's big day, Kareena and Saif have joined Karisma Kapoor, Babita Kapoor and Kiaan Raj and Samaira Kapur at the Pataudi Palace for some quality time off together. But given little Taimur's popularity, it comes as no surprise that Bollywood's biggest names are also wishing the toddler on their Instagram profiles. 
While aunt Karisma is celebrating Taimur's birthday with a throwback picture of herself playing with her nephew, director Karan Johar just wished the young nawab online with a snapshot of him playing with dad Saif, captioned, “I hope you enjoy your times with my babies as much as I have with your mom and dad.” As the day progresses, the wishes are sure to keep coming. Come back for more updates on Taimur's birthday, and catch up on his week so far here.

It only gets better 
The Virushka fever shows no sign of dying down. One of the most talked-about weddings of the year, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's wedding in Italy took everyone by surprise when the news came out. The duo wore Sabyasachi for the series of ceremonies, including the pheras, mehandi and engagement. 
After a short holiday following the nuptials, the newly-weds are back in the country to host two receptions for their extended families and friends. Since designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee dressed the duo for the wedding, we are placing our bets that he would be dressing them for both—the reception in New Delhi today and the one in Mumbai on December 26. 
Anushka Sharma's sense of style is mostly understated, making it hard to imagine the star overly made up even on her big day. Thus far, Sharma has chosen hues of blush pink, maroon and fuchsia for different occasions. Given the label's proclivity is to use gold in their designs be it sparking or antique, we are placing our bets on spotting a gilded look on either of the occasions. Another signature of Sabyasachi's is the use of floral motifs in his work, which is yet another detail that can be expected from Sharma's reception lehenga. 
Sabyasachi's couture collections this year had two distinct aesthetics. The ‘Udaipur Collection' had softer pastel hues whereas the autumn/winter 2017 collection focused on vintage motifs and old-school embroidery. Since the star has already been seen in a pale hue, we are expecting her to be seen in a more opulent look this time round. 
In their past outings together, Virat Kohli's ensembles have complemented those of his better half, and we're pretty sure the duo will be coordinating their looks this evening. Watch this space for more updates.

It's official: Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi drives a tractor better than you. 
The little nawab, who will complete one year on December 20, 2017, has had one action-packed pre-birthday week. On December 17, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan were seen flying out of Mumbai with Taimur in tow, and #Saifeena followers everywhere were sure the couple were heading out of town to celebrate their baby's big day together. Just a day later, Taimur's aunt Karisma Kapoor joined the family at the Pataudi Palace, and her Instagram feed has been full of unmissable birthday updates. 
While Karisma's posts from yesterday included snapshots of herself flying to Delhi with mom Babita Kapoor and kids Kiaan Raj and Samaira Kapur, her latest picture since featured Taimur riding a horse with dad Saif Ali Khan. But if you thought that was as exciting as Taimur's trip gets, you couldn't be more wrong. 
Karisma's newest Instagram shows the entire Kapoor-Khan family taking a drive around Haryana in a red tractor, and it comes as no surprise that birthday boy Taimur scored the best seat available, at the wheel with his father. While Kareena smiles into the camera from behind the Khan men, Babita poses for the shutterbugs hand-in-hand with Saif. What makes the moment twice as cute: Karisma's Insta caption.

Taimur Ali Khan’s pre-birthday fun includes horse riding with his parents 
In case you missed it, this December 20 marks Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan's son, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi's, first birthday. And to bring in their toddler's milestone, the star parents flew over to their family haven, the Pataudi Palace, earlier this week. 
Joined by grandmother Babita Kapoor, aunt Karisma Kapoor and cousins Samaira and Kiaan Raj Kapur, Taimur seems to be having a blast bringing in his birthday. Just last evening, Karisma updated her Instagram stories with sneak peeks of the Pataudi Palace, and a cosy bonfire built for the family to enjoy some quiet time together. In the past few hours, Karisma's Instagram feed has grown to include not just holiday selfies and snapshots of yummy meals, but an adorable picture of Taimur riding a horse during his holiday. 
The post, which in true Taimur fashion is already taking over the internet, features the little nawab (dressed in a red hoodie, jeans and tiny riding boots) sitting with dad Saif on a beautiful mahogany horse, while mom Kareena smiles on with a cup of tea in hand. The backdrop, rows and rows of sun-kissed trees, looks like the perfect winter getaway spot. Wondering what else the Kapoors and Khans have been up to this week? Catch up here, and stay tuned for more updates on Taimur's first birthday.

Welcome, baby Kaling 
Funnywoman Mindy Kaling has given birth to her first child, a daughter named Katherine Kaling. 
According to E! News, the 38-year-old actor gave birth on December 15, after admitting in July the pregnancy news was “unexpected surprise”. 
Saying she was “really excited” to be a mum, Kaling said she would no doubt be a “dorky mum” over a “fun mum”—something we'll agree to disagree on. 
Kaling hasn't yet revealed who the father of the baby is, and has been notoriously private about her relationships in the past. 
Congratulations, Mindy and welcome to the world Katherine!

From ensuring they kept everything under wraps to how long it took to plan

The planners behind the Virushka wedding tell us how they pulled it off 
Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma have long been amongst everyone's favourite couples. But after the cricketer tied the knot with the Bollywood star earlier this week, it's safe to say everyone's been hit by their wedding fever. 
Given that almost no one had a clue about the secret nuptials held in the picturesque region of Tuscany, it is safe to say that this one was amongst the most well-planned weddings of the season. 
The credit for this goes to the team at Shaadi Squad, who left no stone unturned to bring the couple's fairy tale moment to reality. Founded by Tina Tharwani, Saurabh Malhotra and Manoj Mittra, the Mumbai-based, boutique wedding planning company specialises in planning destination weddings. 
Right from picking the location to brainstorming sessions, co-founder Tina Tharwani spills the beans on all the unmissable details from Virushka's wedding. 
How long did it take you to plan the wedding? Virat and Anushka came to us almost four-five months ago in August earlier this year. We always work only on one project at a time and give it all our attention and energy. Currently we are busy planning the two receptions that will be held in Delhi and Mumbai on December 21 and December 26 respectively. 
Since everything about the wedding was kept under wraps, how did you manage to plan the whole thing without letting information out? The biggest USP of Shaadi Squad is client confidentiality. We respect that a wedding is a personal moment in anyone's life so we took utmost care that we were tight-lipped about the whole planning. All the ceremonies were put together by a team of seven people, including the three founders and Rriddhi Talwalkar from India and three people from Tuscany. 
Why was the wedding planned in Tuscany and not India? The couple brainstormed on many locations with us when we were planning the wedding. The one thing they were absolutely sure about was that they didn't want to get married in their hometowns. We considered many Indian locations as well as international destinations before finally picking Tuscany. 
Who did the decor for the nuptials? The entire decor for the wedding was done by Devika Narain and Co who are based out of Delhi. Most of the materials used for the wedding were locally sourced while a few flowers and other things were bought in Tuscany. 
Did the couple give you any specifications for the wedding? Right from the beginning, the two wanted it to be an intimate affair. The guest list was just under 50 people, as they wanted to celebrate only with their closest friends and family. The couple was also very hands-on and invested where planning their wedding was concerned. They knew exactly how they wanted their dream moment to look like but were open to our suggestions. 
Any tips on how people can host a wedding similar to theirs? Most Indian wedding are a big fat affair, but if you manage to keep the guest list small it becomes easier to make the wedding customised and more personal. Generally, destination weddings have at least 200 people these days but if you can keep the gathering small, it becomes easier to understand every wedding guest's wants and needs.

All the details about her wedding makeup 
You've seen Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's wedding over a hundred times on your timeline, from her wedding beauty looks to her outfits, all the details about the location and even their first picture as a married couple. While we've already given you the inside information on Sharma's stunning flower-adorned hairstyles, here's the exclusive scoop on her wedding makeup, straight from her trusted makeup artist, Puneet B Saini. 
Did Anushka have any special brief when you discussed the wedding looks before the event? She wanted everything to look very elegant and beautiful as every bride would want on their wedding day. She left it up to me because I know what she likes. I've been working with her for so many years now that I know my way around her, what she likes. 
How long back did you first have this conversation, to discuss her makeup? I actually found out a day before I was travelling. I wasn't aware of where we were going. She had only booked me for the five days. I'm glad that she didn't tell me because we work with so many people and it becomes difficult for us [to keep things under wraps]. I'm a very transparent person and would've hated to be the one to give out any information. 
You work with Anushka regularly. Was the equation you share with her helpful when planning something potentially stressful like wedding makeup? I've been working with her for over six years, we've worked on seven films, and all her events and appearances. Our equation was everything, for both of us. I've worked with her so much and we've grown together in a way. I wasn't doing too many films before I met her and wasn't interested in it. After Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, she had a lot of films lined up with great directors and that's when we decided to work together. I shut down my makeup academy to start working with her. She's one of the most special people in my life. She wasn't nervous at all before the ceremony. She trusted us a lot and was very calm and centred. 
How did you make sure the makeup looked perfect throughout the ceremony? We were in great weather so I was sure the makeup wasn't going to move. Also with Anushka, the makeup usually stays on, we only had to touch up the lipstick. 
How long did it take to create her makeup look for the ring ceremony and the wedding? Can you take us through the looks? It only took us about 1.5-2 hours on each day, with hair and makeup going on simultaneously. For the ring ceremony which was a night event, we wanted to keep the lips nude and eyes smoky. I wanted her eyes to be striking but not just have a whole lot of black around the eyes. We used a gradation of colours, my favourite aubergine and a brown with red undertones. I didn't want the entire eye to be covered, just till the crease of the eyes. For the mehandi, she was wearing a lot of colours so we kept the makeup fairly basic, very wintery with cream blush, minimal makeup and lots of mascara. All the attention was going to be on her mehandi and clothes. On her wedding day, the outfit was so beautiful and royal and the entire setup was a page out of a princess' diary. We didn't want the makeup to be too smoky or with heavy liner. I kept it very soft, we used a brown kohl and smudged it, shadows in peach-pink tones and lots of mascara. 
Keeping in mind the grandeur of the outfits, what was the makeup aesthetic you were going for? As a bride, you have so much happening on your wedding day, to balance your hair, makeup, outfit and jewellery. I'd say I wanted her to look like herself on her wedding day, that was the aesthetic. We didn't want the makeup to look anything like it did on the night of the ring ceremony, we wanted a complete contrast. We wanted it to enhance her natural beauty. 
Most Indian brides like to go all out when it comes to their makeup, even if that might not complement their outfits. How do you tackle requests like this? I think a lot of brides are misinformed. They feel like they need to wear a lot because everybody is doing it. The new-age brides are very smart, they choose their makeup artist according to their personal style. The most important thing is to have the conversation before the day and not on the main day to see if you're at the same wavelength. To me, if I might not be able to deliver the look a bride wants, I'll ask them to look for somebody else since the look will also be going out as my work. I don't mind working around their demands and try to make it look aesthetic, but if it's not something I'm accustomed to doing, I'd rather have them find someone else. Hair and makeup isn't inexpensive and I'd rather have the bride be happy.

Too cute to miss 
It's safe to say December 2017 has been Virushka's month. After quietly flying out of Mumbai in the first week of the month, the couple tied the knot in a private ceremony in Tuscany on December 11, and the pictures from their special celebration had both, Bollywood and cricket fans everywhere rejoicing for them. 
[#image: /photos/5ce434eccc50be492214013f]||| ||| In heaven, literally 😇😍 Image: Instagram.com/anushkasharma 
After all that excitement, the duo's families are back in the country, but the newly-weds have extended their travels with a mini honeymoon in Europe. Before they return and gear up for their wedding receptions (one in Delhi, and one in Mumbai), the couple are currently spending some time alone surrounded by snowcapped trees, and the very first picture from their getaway is now on Instagram. 
Shared by Sharma, the loved-up snapshot features the couple posing for a selfie in black winter gear. There's no missing Sharma's mehendi and that envy-worthy wedding ring , which is said to be valued at Rs 1 crore. Sharma titled her first (of hopefully many) mini moon picture with the sweetest caption: “In heaven, literally”. Want more details on the duo's big day?

From their first red carpet appearance to the big wedding 
It was just a regular Monday evening in December—that is, before news of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli hit the news (and your Instagram feeds). The infamously quiet but not-so-secret couple took the nation by surprise when news first surfaced that they had, after months of speculation, indeed gotten married in Tuscany, Italy, with just some family in attendance. And then the pictures started pouring in: the stunning Italian countryside bedecked in pastel flowers for backdrop and Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma in matching bespoke Sabyasachi—at the mandap, exchanging garlands, sharing a candid moment. Since then, we've spotted them at their mehandi, the ring ceremony, and more picture-perfect occasions. 
As we wait for more updates from the newly-married couple, we thought we'd take a look back at a timeline of their relationship together, as documented on Vogue.in. 
Vogue Beauty Awards 2015 In one of their first outings together as a pair, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma showed up at the Vogue Beauty Awards 2015 where Sharma won the Beauty of the Year award. Refreshing in a sorbet yellow Gauri & Nainika gown, Sharma let us in on the funny comment Kohli made on her look for the night, “He told me I'm looking like a nimbu tonight.” Check out the slideshow in the story (linked above) for some of their cutest pictures from the event. 
Anushka Sharma nails date night dressing After many “are they” “are they not” moments surrounding their relationship (at one point, they even unfollowed each other on social media!), Kohli put things in order after he took to Instagram to stand up for Sharma and the bullying she faced at the hands of his fans. Soon after, they were spotted out in town for what looked like a dinner date, with Anushka in a smoking skirt-crop top set, perfect for the occasion. 
The engagement rumours begin There was fire, so there's bound to be smoke. After they were spotted on another date in Anushka Sharma's hometown, Bengaluru, rumour mills went overtime with speculation of an engagement towards the end of 2016. So strong was the buzz, that Virat Kohli had to take to Twitter to dismiss it, and #Virushka fans' hopes were crushed, if only momentarily. 
Valentine's Day 2017 While neither of them ever confirmed they were together in so many words, after Virat Kohli's Valentine's Day adorable Instagram post for Sharma, the relationship was as social media-official as it got before they made their wedding announcement. 
Virat's ode to Anushka on Women's Day Just a month after, the Indian skipper made mothers and girlfriends everywhere envious with his post on Women's Day. In the sweet caption to go with a collage of him with his mother and Sharma, he called them both the strongest women in his life. If this didn't set goals for men everywhere, nothing will. 
The case of Virat Kohli's beard Up to this point, most of the couple's Insta-love had been one sided, with Kohli's cutesy updates meeting Sharma's inactivity on the social media platform. In April 2017, Sharma broke the silence by commenting on a Kohli's post, contemplating getting rid of his beard saying, “You cannot!” The message was received, and Kohli replied with an “okay” and goofy emojis. What would we do if it weren't for Instagram. 
Lucky charm Adding to the number of times Virat Kohli made it clear how special Anushka Sharma is to him, the cricketer spoke about how Sharma has been by his side through many of the milestones of his career. “I was in Mohali and there was a Test series going on,” said the cricketer. “Surprisingly, when I became the Test captain, then also she [Sharma] was in Melbourne with me. I was emotional, I was in tears because I never thought this day will come, but it did and I was able to share it with her, which was even more beautiful.” 
Downtime in the Big Apple When IIFA came around this year, all the celebrities headed to New York for a week of awards-related activities. Among them were Kohli and Sharma, trying to squeeze in some vacation time in their hectic schedules. Did you see the adorable update Kohli put up from the vacation? 
Power couple In one of their most recent red carpet sightings, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma showed us that couple dressing doesn't have to be cheesy. Both dressed in suits—Kohli in a tailored navy tux, and Sharma in a siren red Nikhil Thampi—the pair looked every bit in love as they posed for the paparazzi. 
Wedding practice In retrospect, the couple's last outing together was the perfect warm up to their secret nuptials—at Zaheer Khan and Sagarika Ghatge's reception in Mumbai, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma turned up in colour-coordinated outfits (Sharma was in a Sabyasachi lehenga, of course), and even shook a leg when the DJ came on. Little did we know we'd see them at their own wedding just two weeks from the day. 
Have you caught up with everything from Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's wedding yet? Check out what went into the making of that gorgeous pastel Sabyasachi wedding lehenga, how to get Sharma's wedding beauty look, the details of her bright mehandi outfit.

Anushka Sharma’s wedding beauty look: The complete how-to guide 
Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's wedding basically broke the internet when the couple tied the knot in a private affair in Italy early this week. Ever since, people are scouring social media for information on everything from her outfits, to her hair and makeup and even her wedding planners. In an exclusive conversation with Vogue India, the man behind Sharma's stunning hairstyles, celebrity hairstylist Gabriel Georgiou of Anima Creative Management plays insider for us—here's what went behind creating her wedding hairstyles. 
Anushka wanted to look simple and elegant at the same time. When her hair was open, we kept it easy and not too set. Even when it was up, we went for a simple and chic look without having to worry about it, knowing it will last all night. 
It all starts with the wedding dress/outfit and then the whole look slowly comes together, with the accessories, hair and makeup. The idea was ‘pretty in pastels' and like an Indian fairy-tale princess, but with a little western influence. So yes, quite unique. The beautiful pastel-coloured flowers and the way they were placed really added to the look, in harmony with everything else. 
Not long at all. The longest was the bridal look on the big day, only because everything had to be perfect. Even so, probably not longer than a couple of hours for hair and makeup. I must say she was the easiest and calmest bride I've ever worked with. 
Yes, all the looks were done pretty much as planned. 
Not at all. The flowers stayed very fresh and were pinned very well on a bun and around the bun so that they stayed perfectly even with the dupatta pressing on them. 
I think the most important thing is stabilising the hair jewellery pieces and dupatta very well so that they don't move at all, even while dancing, and last for the whole day/night. 
For me, it's a matter of personalisation. I don't like hair that looks like it's from an '80s prom. What's important are the aesthetics and overall look, with the hair playing a major part. Whether the hair is retro-inclined or simple like a slick, it has to be done tastefully and in a more modern, fashion way.

“I will kill you, don’t think I can’t.” 
Salma Hayek has penned a powerful op-ed for the New York Times revealing years of reported harassment and stalking by Harvey Weinstein. 
Hayek details how Weinstein would turn up at her hotel rooms in the middle of the night, call her, ask for sexual favours and threaten her once he didn't get his way. 
For Hayek most of her story centres around her film, Frida, in which the actress portrays legendary artist Frida Kahlo—a film that went on to win two Academy Awards for Best Make-up and Best Original Score, also scoring Hayek a nominations for her portrayal of the artist. 
“Knowing what I know now, I wonder if it wasn't my friendship with them—and Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney—that saved me from being raped,” Hayek wrote in the essay, adding she was naïve to think Weinstein had said yes to her project as she was then a nobody. 
“In his eyes, I was not an artist. I wasn't even a person. I was a thing: not a nobody, but a body,” Hayek revealed, elaborating that once Weinstein said yes to her project she opened herself up to years of stalking and harassment. 
“The range of his persuasion tactics went from sweet-talking me to that one time when, in an attack of fury, he said the terrifying words, ‘I will kill you, don't think I can't.'” 
Weinstein threatened to take Frida away from Hayek so she fought for the rights to the role back from Weinstein and his production company Miramax and did the movie her own way. 
However, Hayek goes on to detail that once Weinstein realised Hayek didn't need him “the sexual harassment stopped but the rage escalated” and the producer then threatened to have the movie set shut down. 
Weinstein reportedly went to tell Hayek he wouldn't let her finish the movie unless there was a sex scene between her and another woman. 
“He had been constantly asking for more skin, for more sex. Once before, Julie Taymor got him to settle for a tango ending in a kiss instead of the lovemaking scene he wanted us to shoot between the character Tina Modotti, played by Ashley Judd, and Frida. 
But this time, it was clear to me he would never let me finish this movie without him having his fantasy one way or another. There was no room for negotiation. 
I had to say yes. By now so many years of my life had gone into this film. We were about five weeks into shooting, and I had convinced so many talented people to participate. How could I let their magnificent work go to waste?” 
Hayek recalls feeling sick and needing to take a tranquiliser to make it through the scene. 
“Since those around me had no knowledge of my history of Harvey, they were very surprised by my struggle that morning. It was not because I would be naked with another woman. It was because I would be naked with her for Harvey Weinstein. But I could not tell them then,” Hayek explains, adding she had kept his harassment a secret for many years. 
Hayek ends her essay by sharing the alarming statistics of women in the industry, asking: “But why do so many of us, as female artists, have to go to war to tell our stories when we have so much to offer? Why do we have to fight tooth and nail to maintain our dignity?”

Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli continue to party after the wedding 
Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's secret wedding in Tuscany has been all anyone can talk about today. Between the numerous ensembles the star wore to her engagement, mehandi, pheras and the beauty looks she tried, style watchers are having a field day keeping up with the extravagance of this celebrity wedding. 
What's a wedding without an epic after party? Hours after the phera ceremony ended, Sharma and Kohli were seen having a blast in at the Borgo Finocchieto in Tuscany. The star changed out of her blush pink Sabyasachi lehenga into a nude gown by the same designer. The lightly ruched dress bore a light watercolour print and sequinned belt to accentuate her waist. Not out of the wedding zone yet, Sharma continued to wear the traditional red bangles she had on during the pheras. Kohli changed into an all-black suit for the festivities. 
Most of the teams involved in executing the wedding in secrecy—photographers, planners, the decor team, stylists and more—finally let their hair down after pulling off Bollywood's biggest wedding of 2017.

The woman who birthed the campaign finds herself on the sidelines of the current movement 
Remember in 2015 when Steve Harvey was belittled and laughed at for calling out the wrong name as Miss Universe? What if I told you that one of the 21st century's largest feminist movements, which brought together women from all over the world to have a single unified conversation around sexual harassment, has done exactly that? What if I showed you that at its core the #MeToo campaign—undoubtedly 2017's biggest muckraker—propagated the very discrimination that it claimed to be fighting? That, while actor Alyssa Milano walked away with all the credit for launching #MeToo, the campaign had actually been created a decade earlier by a social activist from Philadelphia, Tarana Burke? 
More often than not, in the miasma of noise that social media creates, it is not the factual voice but the loudest voice that gets taken as the ultimate truth. So the Taj becomes a symbol of Mughal brutality and Tipu Sultan no longer remains the people's hero. Social media shape shifts the truth. 
No wonder then that few people knew of Burke. A three-time sexual violence survivor, Burke has been a vocal advocate against sexual harassment. Back in 2003 she founded an organisation called Just Be Inc. that provided support and healing to victims of sexual assault. In 2007, Burke renamed the movement she'd been championing against as ‘Me Too'. Over the last ten years she has been actively involved with non-profit organisations that aid victims of sexual assault. 
But her life's work was abnegated by a single tweet. 
A large part of the rewards we seek for our hard work is the plaudits from our contemporaries and the public. For Burke this was not to be so. 
Her story was, of course, not new. From times before and after Darwin (who received credit for the theory of evolution instead of his peer Alfred Russel Wallace) names are lost in the shuffle of time. No wonder then that history is said to be a tale written by men such that women are rarely seen in it. 
But the final nail in the coffin came when TIME magazine chose ‘The Silence Breakers' of the #MeToo movement as their 2017 Person(s) of the Year, and put celebrities like Taylor Swift and Ashley Judd on the cover instead of Burke. This time the abdication was complete. 
Burke's omission sparked a wave of protest around the world along two fault lines: racism and sexism. 
It opened floodgates of racist accusations against white supremacy, with a school of thought dictating that white people had credited themselves for something a black woman had created. This evocation of marginalisation was not unlike the battles we face in India: of untouchables, Dalits, men, the LGBTQ and scores of ‘the forgotten' being alienated from the process of gender equality. And patriarchy has, of course, been a mode of societal norm in the world we've been born into; a currency we're trying to demonetise. 
Feminism has long drawn on the issue of intersectionality. The process of inclusion and participation was made difficult since it was women who were discriminated against or the marginalised who generally became feminists. Then, and—laughably—sometimes even now, feminists were considered ugly or unloved or unlovable or unmarriageable. It is now being said that to ensure the success of the movement, it needs to be more inclusive. Naysayers argue: how inclusive is inclusive? When does it stop? Does it involve non-humans, plants and animals? Ultimately feminism cannot be about one gender dominating the other, or one class overtaking the other. That would be hypocritical and self-negating. 
The controversy surrounding Burke has revealed a sad truth: we can take to social media and shout #MeToo all we want, but when it comes to truly enabling ourselves, we don't do it. We don't know how. 
Despite being sidelined, Burke continues to lend a voice to the broken and ignored, campaigning for empowerment through empathy. She's been quoted as saying, “It isn't about the accolades. It's about awareness.” She believes that the cause is greater than the individual. Just recently she tweeted: “There is very little conversation about queer and trans folks in this moment. No conversation about folks with disabilities. Anywhere you find vulnerable people you will find rampant sexual violence.” She stands by the blinkered and botched, keeping the flame of gender equality alive. She continues to change the conversation while refusing to let the anger die. This makes Burke greater than the sum parts of events surrounding her. 
That's what heroism truly looks like. 
History has long taught us that what is the outrage of today can be the benchmark of tomorrow, that the censor of today can be the artist of tomorrow. Ultimately history is kind to those who have fought and challenged prejudices. We hope it is kind to the likes of Burke too.

Anushka Sharma’s wedding beauty look: The complete how-to guide 
Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli put all wedding rumours to rest last evening by finally tying the knot in Tuscany, Italy. The couple who has been in a relationship since 2014 has made headlines time and again, mostly for always standing up for each other, and for public outings. While both the bride and groom wore outfits by the designer on everybody's wedding list, Sabyasachi, Sharma had her trusted team, comprising of celebrity makeup artist Puneet B Saini and hairstylist Gabriel Georgiou take charge over the beauty department. Over the three functions that took place at the heritage hotel Borgo Finocchieto, Sharma opted for a clean-middle part with straightened hair, matte clean skin and a hint of kohl for her mehandi ceremony. Her beauty look for the engagement took an earthy route and for her wedding, makeup was on the softer, pink side of the colour wheel. Need inspiration for your own wedding? Here's the complete breakdown of these two standout looks. 
The actor kept hair hair simple with a middle-part that stayed standard through all the functions. For this function, she tied it into a bun with large red roses as embellishment. For her makeup, she chose earthy hues with creamy nude on her lips, soft, brown shadow on her eyelids and a hint of bronzer on her cheeks. She further accentuated her eyes with intense black kohl on her upper and lower lash line, and finished off with multiple coats of mascara. 
The actor maintained her middle part and updo combination, but took the adornments up a notch with a bouquet of Tuscan hydrangeas in white and pink set over her bun. She played down her makeup for this look and let her decadent outfit and jewellery take charge. Sharma wore a muted pink eyeshadow, a light rosy hue on her lips and barely-there blush from the same colour family. She lined her lower lash line with kohl with eye-opening mascara for her upper and lower eyelashes.

Did you miss the detail on Anushka Sharma’s custom Sabyasachi lehenga for her mehendi 
By now the internet is flooded with images from Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's sigh-eliciting wedding ceremony in Tuscany. As we know now, the trousseau for both the bride and groom was custom created by couturier Sabyasachi Mukherjee. For the pheras, Sharma wore a blush pink lehenga that was painstakingly hand embroidered by 67 kairigars over a span of 32 days. But for the mehandi, the star chose a lighter, vibrant look. The Bollywood actor wanted a bohemian touch to the look for her mehandi, she was also keen on including hot pink in the ensemble. Keeping her wishes in mind, the designer created a lehenga in which colours were the focus of the look. 
The blouse was designed with artists from The Sabyasachi Art Foundation, who created a pop print reminiscent of the '60s era, that was transferred on the fabric via silk screen printing. The pink and orange lehenga was hand block-printed and embroidered with gota and marori. Sharma picked jhumkas from the Sabyasachi Heritage Jewelry collection, which were crafted in 22k gold with Iranian turquoise, tourmalines, uncut diamonds and Japanese cultured pearls. And while you not have seen images of these, the shoes were also custom created to match the look by the label. 
Virat Kohli went with a with a traditional kurta-churidar worn with a Nehru jacket by Sabyasachi. The cricketer wore custom tan leather juttis with a zardozi crest was that was specially created to complete the ensemble. 
Here's a closer look at Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma from their mehandi ceremony.

Why Anushka Sharma’s wedding lehenga by Sabyasachi was special 
Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's very private wedding ceremony in Tuscany, Italy, went public when images of the happy couple surfaced last evening. Against the stunning Tuscan sky, the happy couple took their vows in front of a small audience comprised of close friends and family. That is not to say that the wedding came completely out of the blue: A few days before Sharma left town, designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee paid a visit to the actor's home, which sparked rumours about the wedding in the first place. 
As the evening progressed, we saw glimpses of the wedding on Sabyasachi Mukherjee's Instagram account, with descriptions detailing the thoughts behind each of the looks. The designer also released a statement, confirming that he had in fact designed all of Sharma and Kohli's looks for the wedding ceremonies. “We designed the clothes for both bride and groom for all the functions—from the engagement to the mehendi, the sangeet and for the wedding and post wedding dinner and heritage jewellery from recently launched Sabyasachi label," he said, "It was wonderful to work with the couple. From the House of Sabyasachi we wish Anushka and Virat a very happy married life.” 
The bride wore a blush pink lehenga for the pheras. Keeping in mind the setting, Mukherjee chose a pastel hue in place of a traditional red one for the ceremony. It took 67 karigars, 32 days to hand embroider the lehenga in silk floss, which bore motifs of exotic birds and butterflies. To complement the pale pink lehenga, the bride wore traditional jewellery—a mathapatti, layered necklaces and jhumkas in jadau, pearls and pink spinel. 
Kohli, who was also dressed by Mukherjee, went classic with an ivory sherwani, a lightly embroidered tussar stole and a pale pink chanderi safa that matched Sharma's lehenga. However, according to the designer, the hero of Sharma's look wasn't the lehenga or the jewellery, it was the fresh hydrangeas the star wore in her hair that added the ‘crowning glory' to the ensemble.

Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi and Roohi and Yash Johar spent their weekend together 
While Bollywood celebrities spend most of their time in the public eye, more often than not, their children are also privy to the flashes of the paparazzi cameras. Case in point: every single picture of Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi attracts even more attention than the previous one. This weekend, he was spotted at Rani Mukerji's daughter Adira's birthday party with other Bollywood children (accompanied by their parents, of course). While Kareena Kapoor Khan was in attendance with Taimur, Karan Johar attended with his twins Roohi and Yash, Sridevi arrived with younger daughter Khushi, Shilpa Shetty Kundra with Viaan, Shah Rukh Khan with AbRam, Arpita Khan Sharma with Ahil (who had Katrina Kaif as his date for the event) and Tusshar Kapoor with Laksshya. 
What looked like a fun fair-themed event had the parents and the children enjoying in equal measure. Karisma Kapoor took to some old school headgear with a headband made from a balloon and Shilpa Shetty Kundra's Sunday binge came early as she gorged on ice cream (she was joined by Arpita Khan Sharma and the hostess Rani Mukerji). In what could be the most adorable moment of the event, Karan Johar captured Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi with Roohi and Yash Johar, a picture he posted on his Instagram with the caption: “And a new friendship begins….”. The parents also came together with some of the children for group photos, with Rekha fondly carrying Yash Johar in her arms. 
Also in attendance at the birthday were Alia Bhatt, Karisma Kapoor, Rekha, Vaani Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Raveena Tandon. 
Check out the gallery above for a look at all the inside pictures from Adira Chopra's birthday party.

From his reaction to Katrina Kaif's looks to what he eats on set 
Salman Khan joined Katrina Kaif on Vogue India's December 2017 cover in what was a first for the actor, who has enjoyed a loyal following ever since he made his lead debut in Maine Pyaar Kiya, and went on to star in Bollywood blockbusters like Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Judwaa, Dabangg and more. If you're a fan of the Tiger Zinda Hai star and love collecting trivia about his life, here are five things that happened on the set of our cover shoot that may interest you: 
1 
Each time he saw Katrina Kaif stepping out of the van in her look for a  shot, he had a natural, genuine look of awe on his face that was priceless. 
2 
No on-set buffet for him. He had a full spread of delicious-looking food brought to him from home and he was sweet enough to offer it to us. It looked healthy too; we spotted some brown rice in there. 
3 
Contrary to what you would expect from a celebrity, as soon as Salman Khan arrived on set, he said, “chalo I'm ready, let's start”. Actors usually take 40 minutes to an hour to be ready for a shot once they're on set. He announced he would need only 10 minutes for hair and makeup as he had started in the car, and he stuck to his word: He was in front of the camera in 10 minutes. 
4 
With fans following every move and even arriving on far-flung sets just to get a peek, it would be understandable if the star sought some quiet time in his vanity van between shots. But Khan doesn't like sitting in the van. Instead, there is a set-up of tables and chairs in a tent right outside his van, which makes it easier for his loyalists to access him. 
5 
The celebrity loves breaking into his famous dialogues in his iconic accent from time to time. This takes you straight back to the Salman Khan you knew and loved growing up.

Why everyone from Rihanna to Kim Kardashian West are supporting her case 
Cyntoia Brown was just 16 years old in 2006 when she was picked up by a 43-year-old man who paid her for sex. He ended up dead by her hand that same night. 
At the time she was living with a pimp who had been selling her, violently abusing her sexually, mentally, and physically while also providing her with drugs. 
She was convicted for murder—as an adult—and sentenced to life in prison. She will be eligible for parole after she turns 69. 
If Brown were tried as a minor, she would have been released by age 19. Although the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that mandatory life sentences for juveniles without the possibility of parole or automatic review are unconstitutional, that decision does not apply to Brown due to Tennessee law. 
Tennessee law requires an automatic review of life sentences after 51 years; at least 183 people in the state are serving life sentences for crimes committed when they were teenagers. 
Brown's case re-entered the spotlight this month after a group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and Snoop Dogg posted their support on social media with the hashtag, #FreeCyntoiaBrown. 
An online petition urging Tennessee's governor to consider clemency for Brown has garnered more than 4,000 signatures. 
Brown recently graduated with an Associates of Arts degree with a GPA of 4.0 from Lipscomb University's LIFE Program (Lipscomb Initiative For Education), and she will soon earn her Bachelor's degree from Lipscomb. 
This story is likely returning to the spotlight because more women are coming forward about sexual abuse. Brown hopes her case has an impact on how the criminal justice system treats children who are victims of sex trafficking.

Gucci’s collaboration with this artist is as interesting as it covetable 
If you follow the Gucci-verse and are a fan of Gucci-fication, you're aware that Alessandro Michele loves joining forces with artists. Be it Jayde Fish, Coco Capitán, Gucci Ghost or honouring Dapper Dan in a campaign, Michele's narrative at Gucci is willing to include more voices than his own. However, the one artist whose work runs in tandem with Gucci's renaissance-meets-eclectic charm is that of Helen Downie, better known as the 'Unskilled Worker'. 
Michele discovered Downie on Instagram and invited her to Gucci's 2015 No Longer/Not Yet exhibit in Shanghai. This holiday season, the two have come together for a 40-piece capsule collection of T-shirts, blouses, skirts, dresses, jeans and accessories. If you spend a little time on the Unskilled Worker's feed, you will be introduced to the characters she paints meticulously. From same-sex families, families of colour, friends who influenced her, gardens she visits, pets and other details from her personal life, all make it to her canvas in unexpected ways. 
The collection with Gucci features her artwork and each product will bear bespoke packaging also designed by the artist. The unique line is available worldwide and on Gucci's website, and, as an added bonus, Unskilled Worker has painted an exclusive piece of work that the artist has made available as a free download on Gucci.com and Unskilled Worker.co.uk from October 11, 2017.

Going down memory lane 
Yesterday, Bollywood thespian Shashi Kapoor passed away at the age of 79, at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai. To pay his tribute to the seminal actor and a beloved co-star, Amitabh Bachchan took a walk down memory lane and shared an emotional letter on his blog. Penning down some of his dearest memories with Kapoor, Bachchan remembers the times he met the actor at parties, he himself just starting out in the industry back then. 
“ Shashi Kapoor !” was what one heard as he extended a warm soft hand out to you in introduction ; that devastating smile complimenting the twinkle in his eyes. He needn't have done so. Every one knew him. But this was his infectious humble self. When he spoke, there was a mischievous, gentle, almost inaudible, delicate, yodel, in his voice - most endearing and comforting to the one he was introduced to. The self introduction habit, was a gem. The one being introduced to, was, quite obviously, prompted to say his or her name as well, when they heard his. It was a remarkable tool to come to know the other persons name .. and .. if and when there was to be another meeting after many forgettable years, the same technology was most helpful in remembering the other persons name, in case you had forgotten it .. !! 
In the post, Bachchan also talks about how Kapoor actually inspired the hairstyle he's sported through most of his career: 
The next .. was his semi curly hair on head, falling carelessly over his forehead and ears, not quite covering it ..  and my upper story mumbled again : ‘hey ! maybe you should think of covering your ears as well ..' … and off I went to Hakim the hair dresser at Taj Hotel with my plan .. and executed, it remained till date .. 
Ending the letter on a bittersweet note, Bachchan recalls the nickname Shashi Kapoor had given him: 
He fondly addressed me as ‘babbua' .. and with him have gone many incredible unread chapters of his and my life .. 
Condolences and wishes started pouring in yesterday after the news broke. Among those who took over their social media to express their sorrow included Karisma Kapoor, Karan Johar, Nimrat Kaur, Sunil Shetty, Raveena Tandon, Neetu Kapoor and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Gauri Khan just revealed Shweta Bachchan Nanda’s hidden talent 
Weekends may be reserved for rest and relaxation, but Shweta Bachchan Nanda proves that that's no reason you can't squeeze in a little shopping and bonding with friends. Last Friday, Bachchan Nanda dropped into Gauri Khan Designs in Juhu to browse through her friend's store. The interior designer welcomed Bachchan Nanda with an Instagram greeting, captioned "Writer... talented hairstylist... and so much more! Welcome to GKD,” revealing Bachchan Nanda's hidden talent for, of all things, hairstyling. 
Known for her refined style choices, Bachchan Nanda showed up wearing a ruffled red top and olive green cargo pants, while Khan opted for a simpler look with her striped Kaftan dress. Bachchan Nanda was joined by other visitors at the store: longtime friend Kaajal Anand and businessman Arvind Dubash. 
As women from two of Bollywood's most famous houses, Bachchan Nanda and Khan have been good friends for years and often hang out at parties and celebrations. Bachchan Nanda even joined Khan for her husband Shah Rukh Khan's grand birthday getaway in Alibaug last month. 
Gauri Khan's interior design store in Juhu is a popular home-shopping haven for some of Bollywood's biggest, with everyone from Ranbir Kapoor to Karan Johar having stopped by to pick up some home decor.

Mumbai animal lovers, block your dates 
“A dog has no use for fancy cars, big homes, or designer clothes. A water log stick will do just fine. A dog doesn't care if your rich or poor, clever or dull, smart or dumb. Give him your heart and he'll give you his.”  Josh Grogan, author of Marley & Me, that heart-wrenching tale of a loyal family dog, pretty much summed up what it's like to open up your heart to a dog. And if you're sitting on the fence about bringing an animal into your life, I dare you to stare into the big brown eyes of a sad-faced, abandoned puppy and come out feeling nothing. 
And if dogs and their enthusiasm scare you, and you're more of an idol worshipper, then the house cat is for you. With their ability to take care of themselves, and nonchalance, it'll basically be like living with a catty, extremely well-groomed roommate. So, head down to the 7th edition of WFA's adoptathon.

She might be the first Bollywood celebrity to attend a British royal's wedding

Is Priyanka Chopra going to be at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding? 
After the official announcement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement, Priyanka Chopra sent across her love to the soon-to-be royal couple with the sweetest post on Instagram. A close friend of the Suits star, Chopra shared the official picture of the couple with a sweet caption that said, “Congratulations to my girl @meghanmarkle and Prince Harry!! I'm so happy for you Meg! You deserve the best always..keep smiling that infectious smile. Xoxo 🎉🥂❤️👰” The post has sparked off speculation if the Bollywood star will attend the royal wedding come spring 2018. 
Chopra first met Markle at a party in Toronto, Canada, when Markle was shooting for her popular legal drama series. The two first grew close after Markle interviewed the Quantico actor for the lifestyle blog she used to run, and they've been spotted on each other's social media enjoying some girl time with pool days and cocktail dates ever since. There have also been rumours of Chopra being one of Markle's bridesmaids in the upcoming royal wedding in May 2018. 
Ever since Priyanka Chopra set foot in Hollywood, she has made a bunch of friends with fellow actors, including Markle and Sofia Vergara, but being a part of Markle's bridal entourage at the royal wedding would make for an exciting milestone in their friendship. Plus, if Chopra attends, she might be the first Bollywood celebrity to ever be a part of a British royal's wedding ceremony. Until we know for sure, check out our slideshow to catch all of Chopra and Markle's cutest moments.

From where he proposed to how she said yes, we’ve got it all 
You'll always know where you were and what you were doing when the usually reclusive Prince Harry of Wales and Suits actor Meghan Markle announced that we have a royal wedding to prepare for. It started out as another routine Monday, with the hands of the clock doing their usual slow dance between 11am and 11:01am—except for one happily engaged couple. The much-in-love Prince Harry and Markle decided to make things official and announced that they are set to walk down the aisle in spring 2018. You may not be invited, but we know that you've got the date marked in red in your calendar already. 
After a quaint photo call with the Kensington Palace as the backdrop, the newly-engaged couple sat down for a tell-all interview with BBC's Mishal Husain. From her first reaction to the detailed specs of the ring, go ahead and shoot your questions. 
“It was just a cosy night, we were roasting a chicken, when he got down on one knee. It was an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic. I could barely let him finish proposing, I said—can I say yes now?” laughed Markle, while the Prince agreed, “She didn't even let me finish, she said, ‘Can I say yes, can I say yes?' I had the ring in my finger and I was like, ‘Can I give you the ring?' She goes, ‘Oh yes, the ring!' It was just the two of us and I think I managed to catch her by surprise as well.”

Why Meghan Markle’s engagement ring is valued by experts as ‘priceless’ 
“We were introduced by a mutual friend in the beginning of July. And about three, maybe four weeks later I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana. We camped out with each other under the stars, it was absolutely fantastic,” he raved while she added, “Just to take the time to be able to go on long country walks and just talk.” 
“I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly quickly—it was a confirmation to me that all the stars were aligned. This beautiful woman literally tripped and fell into my life. I fell into her life and the fact that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it as well is obviously a huge relief to me because she'll be able to deal with everything else that comes with it,” he affirmed. 
“It's been a year and a half since we met but I don't think I would call it a whirlwind relationship. Obviously there have been layers attached to how public it has become after we had a good five, six months almost with just privacy, which was amazing. But no, I think we were able to really have so much time just to connect and we never went longer than two weeks without seeing each other, even though we were obviously doing a long distance relationship. So we made it work.” 
“The ring is obviously yellow gold because that's her favourite. The main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother's jewellery collection to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together,” asserted Prince Harry. 
“It's beautiful and he designed it! ...Obviously not being able to meet his mom, it's so important to me to... to know that she's a part of this with us. It's incredibly special. And you know to be able to have this [thing] which sort of links where you come from, and Botswana which is important to us, and it's perfect,” the 36-year-old smiled. 
“Oh, they'd be thick as thieves, without question. I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me,” he gushed before adding, “It is days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But I'm sure she's with us, you know, jumping up and down somewhere else.” 
“It's incredible you know... to be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honour and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother, all of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her I had such a deep understanding, and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her,” Markle smiled. 
“The corgis took to you straight away. I've spent the last 33 years being barked at; this one walks in, absolutely nothing…” he rued, with her piping in, “Just laying on my feet during tea, it was very sweet.” “… just wagging tails and I was just like argh,” the Prince finished.

Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli hit the dancefloor at Zaheer Khan’s reception 
After announcing their engagement back in April this year, cricketer Zaheer Khan and Sagarika Ghatge tied the knot in a private ceremony on November 22. But if you thought the couple were going to leave their big moment at just that, you couldn't have been more wrong. 
As the week progressed, Khan and Ghatge brought their closest friends together at Mumbai's St Regis Hotel for a post-wedding party, and also hosted a mehendi on November 26. The week-long celebrations came to a grand end last night with a reception that was held at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. 
There to congratulate the newly-weds were some of their favourite people including Yuvraj Singh and wife Hazeel Keech, Sania Mirza, Suresh Raina and wife Priyanka Chaudhary, and Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli, who were greeted by the couple with lots of hugs. 
In case you missed it, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma hit the dance floor like no other couple last night, and videos of them busting out their moves have already began to flood the internet. While Kohli kept his look classic in a grey suit, Sharma opted for a black lehenga, worn with a shimmering full-sleeved blouse and chandelier earrings. Check out all the pictures now.

Sources confirm her casting in 'Student Of The Year 2' 
Just days after Ananya Panday made her society debut at Le Bal in Paris, the buzz is growing of the young star kid making her Bollywood debut in Karan Johar's Student Of The Year 2, as the female lead opposite Tiger Shroff. While rumours about this casting have been afloat for some time, reports have now confirmed that Karan Johar zeroed in on Chunky Panday's elder daughter after her stellar audition. A source was quoted as saying, “Karan, Tiger Shroff and director Punit Malhotra were present at the audition where Ananya was asked to read out Alia's lines from Student Of The Year. And Ananya sailed through like a professional. Karan immediately decided to cast her." 
Panday is the newest addition to the batch of Bollywood's next gen making their entry on to the silver screen in 2018, with Saif Ali Khan's daughter Sara Ali Khan making her debut in Abhishek Kapoor's Kedarnath and Sridevi's daughter Janhvi Kapoor starring alongside Shahid Kapoor's brother Ishaan Khatter in Karan Johar's other production, Dhadak. 
Karan Johar's first Student of The Year film served as a launch pad for Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra into Bollywood, making Panday's casting as a fresh face in the film industry even more fitting.

Say hello to your new favourite role model 
Rukhmabai Raut: one of India's first practising female doctors who fought child marriage at its archaic best during colonial India. If you didn't have that inspiring name branded in your head already, allow Google to rectify the error. Once you've fetched a steaming cup of java and settled in your swivel chair at work, the Google Doodle is the first thing your eyes hit—a palm-sized graphic ensuring that you've got your daily quota of general knowledge and have something interesting to throw in during those lulls in coffee machine conversations. And today's honour goes to this successful multi-hyphenate, whose 153rd birthday is being celebrated with a custom Google Doodle. 
Born today in Bombay in 1864, Rukhmabai Raut was married off at the age of 11 to a 19-year-old man, Dadaji Bhikaji Raut. She, however, staunchly refused to live in her marital home and gave priority to her education instead. 
Once she had neared 20 years of age, Dadaji appealed the Bombay High Court to have her move in with him. Over the course of the next three years, the case was debated in both England and India, with the court ultimately declaring that she move in with her husband or face six months of imprisonment. Raut proudly chose the latter. 
The oppressive verdict was subsequently overruled by Queen Victoria, which served as a catalyst for the government to usher in the Age of Consent Act, 1891, despite rigid opposition from conservative families in India. 
Having attained legal separation from her husband in 1888, Raut penned multiple letters in newspapers and publications using the pseudonym 'A Hindu Lady' that awarded her the love and support of the locals, and ultimately helped generate a fund to support her desire to study medicine. She completed her course at the London School of Medicine for Women under the patronage of Dr Edith Pechey of Bombay's Cama Hospital. 
Once she returned as a qualified physician, she dedicated the next 35 years of her life to helping people in Rajkot and Surat, where she served as the chief medical officer. 
Being a victim of child marriage herself, she actively campaigned against the institution, right up until the age of 91 when she passed away peacefully on September 25, 1955. 
Depicted standing proud and unfazed in the Doodle as she was in life, in what was hitherto considered male territory, Raut served as a trailblazer. “Today's Doodle by illustrator Shreya Gupta shows the courageous doctor among her patients, doing the dedicated work of a skilled physician,” read the accompanying blog post by Google. 
Google's Doodle couldn't have come at a better time—with headlines ringing in the truth of these chaotic times, we could all use a little inspiration to tide us through. But make no mistake; this isn't Google's only endeavour to shine the light on the path-breaking, trailblazing women who complement India's nuanced history. Here are a few others that have been celebrated on the search engine's homepage.

Kareena Kapoor Khan takes an excited Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi to a playdate 
Whether he's off jet-setting with mom Kareena Kapoor Khan or bundled up in dad Saif Ali Khan's arms, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi is one of Bollywood's most popular babies. Recently, he was spotted accompanied by his mother, heading out to a playdate with Tusshar Kapoor son, Laksshya Kapoor. While the tiny nawab is mostly seen sharing special moments with his parents and family, Laksshya Kapoor is clearly one of his closest buddies. The two regularly hang out together and little Laksshya's first birthday was actually the very first birthday party attended by Taimur. 
Kapoor Khan has had a busy few months shooting for her upcoming film Veere Di Wedding. Shuttling from Mumbai to Delhi and even Thailand, Kapoor Khan has always done her best to make sure Taimur gets as much time with her as possible, even taking him along for some schedules. But now that the film has wrapped up one leg of the shoot, the star finally has some down time with her son, which she's clearly making the most of. 
For this special playdate, Taimur sported an adorable pair of overalls with a snug full-sleeved white tee, while Kapoor Khan paired a red plaid shirt with boots to embrace the chill in the air. Don't miss out on their adorable pictures in our slideshow.

Let's talk business 
Bollywood's millennial star, Alia Bhatt never hesitates in trying something new. From fulfilling her professional commitments to doing her bit for the society by taking part in initiatives like Co-Exist and now dipping her toe in the business world, there's very little that Alia Bhatt cannot do. Taking her love for fashion one step forward, on November 20, the actor announced her association with fashion-tech start-up StyleCracker, by investing a small share in the company. Co-owned by Dhimaan Shah and celebrity stylist Archana Walavalkar, StyleCracker is India's very first and one of its kind fashion styling platform that aims at bridging the gap between the individuals seeking sartorial help and experienced stylists by providing round-the-clock styling tips to their customers. 
Excited about the collaboration, co-founder and creative director Archana Walavalkar said, “Alia and I have had a very long journey as both of us started together in the Bollywood industry. I have been associated with Alia since her very first film and have been styling her for a very long time, so she was a very obvious choice for us. We are very excited about this whole association with her as we have someone so likeminded who is a part of our team now. Alia is also very excited about the journey and has so many new fun ideas for StyleCracker." 
Launched in 2013, the platform is best known for its StyleCracker Box—a curation of on-trend clothes, accessories, footwear and beauty products. The personalised box is curated keeping in mind the customer's personal style and size information. Besides dispensing styling tips and the StyleCracker Box, they also host The StyleCracker Borough, an exciting fashion event bringing together fashion labels offering amazing discounts and fun activities. 
"Alia Bhatt is such a big youth style icon herself that having someone like her along us is like opening new doors. Her fan following is so loyal and they are so supportive of everything that she does that we are looking forward to explore that side of the market as well. Till now, we were aiming at work-driven young mothers, entrepreneurs and cooperates. But now we are very happy to expand to the youth as well, catering to the millennials specially. With the idea of styling every Indian, having Alia with us is really going to help us reach there", explains Walavalkar. 
The styling platform currently catering to the style needs of young women will soon be expanding to men's styling needs too. "Styling is not gender limited; we are planning to start with men's styling soon. We have so many men inquiring on fashion. So, we are ready to go with menswear styling also, the team and technology both are in place," she says.

How Aishwarya Rai Bachchan celebrated Aaradhya’s 6th birthday 
Aaradhya Bachchan turned six yesterday, and to celebrate, parents Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan hosted a birthday party at JW Marriott in Juhu, Mumbai. The youngest member of the Bachchan clan looked every bit the birthday girl in a pink frock with a hairband to match, while her mother opted for a dark blue off-shoulder dress trimmed with a lace hem. Also spotted at the celebration were grandparents Vrinda Rai, Rai Bachchan's mom, and Amitabh Bachchan. The latter was spotted twinning in matching printed hoodies with son Abhishek. 
Making things even more special on the joyous occasion was Amitabh Bachchan's special tweet for his granddaughter, captioned “T 2712 - When she will remind us how much she has grown .. Aaradhya on her 6th .. !!😀😀🌹🌹”

Here’s your first look at Janhvi Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter’s debut film 
Janhvi Kapoor's Bollywood debut has been talked about for longer than we can keep track of. From speculations of her being a part of Student Of The Year 2 to the final announcement last week that she would be launched with Shahid Kapoor's brother Ishaan Khatter (did you spot them at Deepika Padukone's house party?), Karan Johar has finally put all rumours to rest by releasing the posters his new project Dhadak with both the debutants in the lead, giving fans a first look at the feature. 
Earlier today, Johar posted a video on his Instagram feed talking about Sidharth Malhotra, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt's journey from Student Of The Year to now, and teased the fact that two new actors were now being launched by Dharma Productions. He went on to reveal the first look of the Sairat remake with three further posts, with one main poster and two others focusing on each of the debutants. According to the posters, Dhadak is slated to release on July 6, 2018, and will be directed by the man behind Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and Badrinath Ki Dulhania, Shashank Khaitan. 
While this is Kapoor's first brush with the film industry—we've seen her prep for it with a rigorous workout routine and dance classes at The Space in Juhu—Khatter was last in Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi's Beyond The Clouds, which will open the International Film Festival Of India in Goa this month. 
Today is a very special day @dharmamovies ... Here's why!!!

Janhavi Kapoor just made her Instagram account public 
Whether it's for her chic airport style or scene-stealing festive looks, Sridevi and Boney Kapoor's elder daughter Janhvi Kapoor has been right in the spotlight recently. 
The star kid, who just started shooting for her big Bollywood debut Dhadak with Shahid Kapoor's brother Ishaan Khatter, long had an Instagram account that was private to all but her closest. But yesterday, right in time for the release of her movie's first look, the debutant opened her feed for her followers with a verified account that already had about 45,000 followers at the time of publishing this piece. In a sea of fan-made pages if you find yourself struggling to get to her official account, her handle is @janhvikapoor. 
One look at her page and you would see the hashtag #Dhadak all over her feed, as Kapoor recently shared four official posters of the film that is being co-produced by Karan Johar's banner Dharma Production. The upcoming flick that is slated for a July 6, 2018 release, is being directed by Shashank Khaitan, who created Bollywood blockbusters like Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and Badrinath Ki Dulhania. The 19-year-old seems pretty excited, naturally, for her big release, evident from her caption of the first poster: “Omg guys I'm in a movie!!! #धड़क #Dhadak”. 
From vacation selfies and OOTD posts to cute Boomerangs and throwback pictures with sister Khushi Kapoor, follow the millennial star for regular updates on her life. Scroll through our slideshow to catch some highlights from Janhvi Kapoor's life, as seen on Instagram so far.

Make room for Twilly d’Hermès 
In one word, Twilly d'Hermès looks like freedom. A bright luminescent bubblegum peach shines through the square bottle topped with a glossy black bowler hat. The finishing touch—a colourful Hermès scarf around the neck—makes it the perfect little accessory to carry around in your bag. 
But what's special about this little scent, is that its perfumer, Christine Nagel, drew her inspiration from young, contemporary women who turn convention on their head. “Playfulness is in their nature," she says of the muse. "The idea came while observing young women on the street. I observed them in groups, as these young women are rarely alone. I saw them re-appropriate our objects, particularly our silk scarves. I watched them subvert our codes and create a new world for themselves from this heritage, with energy, imagination and boldness,” she explains. 
What's in it? The three-ingredient perfume—a blend of ginger, tuberose and sandalwood—is a manifestation of the young millennial women who have fun together, without ever renouncing their individuality. And so does the scent, with each note keeping its individual unique sense of scent so that the trio is woven together but none impair the other. 
What does it smell like? Not overtly sweet or powdery—because that's exactly what Nagel was venturing away from—Twilly is all that lighter, fresher with just a hint of sweet to balance the intensity of ginger. 
What does it feel like? It's this cheerfulness, this strong sense of individuality and love for freedom, that makes this perfume the kind you want to spritz to brighten up a day. Or like Nagel describes it, “this creation echoes the free spirit that inspires the house of Hermès, and its astonishing ability to challenge the status quo, to be enterprising and innovative.”

Priyanka Chopra and Sofia Vergara are Hollywoods new bffs 
Priyanka Chopra set some serious friendship goals this weekend at the David Webb x Stop Cancer charity event in Beverly Hills, LA, as she joined Modern Family actor Sofia Vergara. The pair were spotted having a blast at the event as they traded giggles and clinked glasses of champagne with friends Elizabeth Hammer, Nazanin Boniadi and Mubina Rattonsey. 
Vergara chose a dainty floral maxi dress for the occasion and Chopra was seen in an off-shoulder gingham number. While Vergara gushed about how fun her night with the beautiful ladies was on her Instagram feed, Chopra also shared their merry moment with her fans in a special Instagram post. 
Chopra has made her share of Hollywood girl friends since her 2015 debut on television with American series Quantico, but she always seems happiest around Vergara. The pair were last spotted together in a cracking up at the Golden Globes 2017 red carpet. The two also filmed a cheeky elevator video at the event. 
Chopra is currently stationed in New York as she shoots for the third season of Quantico, while simultaneously working for upcoming Hollywood films A Kid Like Jake which also stars Jim Parsons and Claire Danes and Isn't It Romantic?, which will see her alongside Liam Hemsworth, Rebel Wilson and Vergara's Modern Family co-star, Adam Devine. 
Chopra also took some time out this weekend to say hello to her fans in a live video on Instagram after she reached a grand number of 20 million followers on her account. With all her exciting new projects and friendships, Chopra really seems to have made herself at home in the Hollywood dream.

'Catwalking: Photographs by Chris Moore' is a timeline of modern fashion 
If there's anyone who has seen fashion unfold before his eyes, it's photographer Chris Moore. He has captured a parade of Saint Laurent's Le Smoking on models the designer used throughout his career (YSL spring/summer 2002) and documented the OG supermodels of the '90s. For six decades, Chris Moore has photographed every runway moment and now, come November 7, his book, Catwalking, will document his extensive work. 
Comprising essays by fashion critic Alexander Fury (and produced in collaboration with him), Catwalking presents a visually compelling timeline of the history of modern fashion. Offering an extensive overview of the influence of '90s fashion, some of the most distinctive moments featured in the book include McQueen's bumsters (autumn/winter 1994-95); his last collection, Plato's Atlantis (spring/summer 2010); Galliano's at his sartorial best, his early '90s work; and, of course Versace's autumn/winter 1991-92, when the Supers marched down the runway mouthing ‘Freedom', a historic moment recently recreated by Donatella for Versace's spring/summer 2018 show in memory of her late brother Gianni. 
Nicknamed ‘Bishop' by his peers, Moore has contributed to the fashion world with work that is seminal to both, fashion archivists and enthusiasts. And one can only imagine the effect of Fury's words coupled with visuals by the octogenarian photographer.

Unveiling the predatory side of the business 
Harvey Weinstein went from one of the most powerful men of Hollywood and founder of Miramax to sexual predator in a watershed moment when a series of celebrities went public with their horrifying experiences with Weinstein. In a count that last went up to around 60 accusations of harassment and 27 of sexual assault, celebrities like Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Ashley Judd have came forward with their own disturbing experiences of sexual misconduct and harassment with Weinstein. 
It was clear once the cases started coming out that given the power and position Weinstein enjoyed in Hollywood, it would have been near impossible for young stars to draw attention to what they had been through without fear of it permanently damaging their careers. Perhaps even more dispiriting was the thought of how many more such incidents had been silenced, owing to the victims' fears that their voices would not be heard. 
As anticipated, Weinstein is not the only of his kind. Director and producer Brett Ratner is the latest Hollywood figure to be accused of using his power to gain sexual favours from female actors and assistants. Ratner has a host of popular films and TV series to his name including the Rush Hour series, Entourage, X-Men: The Last Stand, New York I Love You and The Revenant. In a revelatory story by Los Angeles Times, six women have come forward with their stories of sexual harassment accusing Ratner. 
In the interview, Olivia Munn spoke about her time visiting the sets of After the Sunset as an aspiring actor. She said Ratner masturbated in front of her when she went to deliver a meal in his trailer. Natasha Henstridge, another actor named in the article, talks about how the director “strong-armed" and "physically forced himself on" her. 
According to the New York Times, Ratner released a statement "saying that 'in light of the allegations being made' he was stepping away from all activities related to Warner Bros., the movie studio with which he has a $450 million agreement to co-finance films. 'I don't want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved,' he said." 
Amongst other allegations of similar nature, actor Anthony Rapp has accused  Kevin Spacey of sexual assault when he was a minor. An assistant on the popular Netflix series House Of Cards also described Spacey's demeanour as predatory to CNN. 
In light of these revelations, women and men have been speaking out about their own experiences of sexual assault in hope that raising awareness on the matter by sharing personal stories will empower people like them and not let the predator win.

Where are Gauri and Suhana Khan cruising off to with their friends? 
November 2 marks Shah Rukh Khan's 52nd birthday, and it looks like the celebrations for his big day have already begun. 
The star's closest family members and friends were seen out and about today, boarding a private ferry from Mumbai's Gateway of India. Rumour has it that this year, Khan will be celebrating his birthday at his Alibaug residence, and Gauri Khan has made sure to reach the venue early to help set up for the occasion. Joining her for the mid-week getaway were mother Savita Chhibbar and some of the celebrity interior designer's closest buddies including Sussanne Khan, Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Maheep Kapoor, Seema Khan, Anu Dewan, Bhavana Pandey and designer Vikram Phadnis too. We also spotted Suhana Khan joining the crew for the trip with her friends Shanaya Kapoor and Anandya Pandey. 
While Gauri picked a navy blue blouse and a matching skirt for her afternoon by the sea, daughter Suhana opted for an oversized Givenchy tee and shorts. The last time she stepped out this week, it was in a bold gold Monisha Jaising mini dress at Gauri's Halloween-themed Cirque le Soir celebration. Busy promoting Ittefaq, Shah Rukh hasn't been spotted out with family over the past few days, but with his birthday just hours away, Bollywood fans can't wait to see the star (and son AbRam) join his favourite people in Alibaug to celebrate his milestone moment. 
Just two years ago, Vogue celebrated the Bollywood icon's 50th birthday with him as our cover star. In his interview, Shah Rukh confessed to several things, from wanting to be Batman to showing respect to people, and why he hasn't set foot in Hollywood yet. “I'm turning 50. I don't have a USP. I'm not a Kung Fu fighter. I'm not a great dancer. I'm not the best-looking guy around. At 50, Hollywood has much better actors than me. So unless somebody writes a film with a 50-year-old Indian in the lead… something like The Pianist… or a brown Bond… Until then the chances of Shah Rukh Khan going to Hollywood are slim.” Before we celebrate his latest birthday, get to know the star a little better in here.

It’s almost here! 
Since his birth back in December 2016, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, son of Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan, has already become a social media favourite. Whether the toddler is attending a birthday party with his mom, hanging out at home in a white kurta just like his dad, or even just snoozing on the way to the airport, he manages to top trending charts all over the country. Most recently, Taimur was in the news for twinning with his mother in shades of blue at Soha Ali Khan Pataudi's birthday celebrations, and for pictures of him celebrating Diwali for the first time ever. 
As we head towards the end of the year, we also come closer to little Pataudi's first birthday, and the topic has already got Bollywood fans wondering how the Kapoor-Khan family is going to celebrate the milestone moment. Recently, aunt Karisma Kapoor put some of the speculation to rest, revealing the family's birthday plans for their newest member. 
"Yes, Taimur's birthday is arriving and it is a special moment for us,” Kapoor said to a news portal. “The family is really very excited and thrilled about the same. We will have a family get together of sorts, and will not be having a big celebration." Want more details? You'll have to wait till December 20 to know more.

Actually, #ManCrushMondaytoSunday 
Not only is he only the best cricketer out there right now, he's also an ace feminist, sets near-impossible #BoyfriendGoals and is also a good actor to boot, as seen in his latest ad with Anushka Sharma. Not just this, the last time we met him for our Vogue Beauty Awards, he was charming, chivalrous and respectful of Sharma and everyone around. He even took a picture for our managing editor's son, who is a huge fan. 
Circling back to cricket, Virat Kohli just became the fastest to score 9000 runs in ODIs, in less than a decade from his debut, breaking all records. He made this record score in 202 ODI matches, beating the previously held record by AB de Villiers, who made 9000 ODI runs in 214 ODI matches. 
To paraphrase the immortal words of Chandler Bing, could he get any better?

Public service announcements with a liberal dose of humour 
"Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no river wide enough, if you need us, call us!" 
Who'd have thought our men in khaki could (rock and) roll with the times? This tweet however (and many more before it) is proof. With 3.9 million followers (on last count), the Mumbai Police account has been slaying it with cleverly worded tweets and quick response to complaints since its Twitter debut two years ago. The hashtags, memes and puns have made the department absolute winners with Mumbai's twitterati, with several retweets every day. While the humour ensures eyeballs, the message, whether about cyber stalking, drugs, traffic rules and other important public service announcements, is loud and clear—they're here, they're watching, they're doing all they can to keep you safe. While we've got several favourites, we've picked a few recent tweets we absolutely love.

Think summery lehengas and loads of drama 
Mahurat out tomorrow! #GetReadyForVeereDiWedding @sonamkapoor #KareenaKapoorKhan @reallyswara @shikhatalsania @sumeetvyas @rheakapoor @ektaravikapoor @ghoshshashanka @balajimotionpictures @anilkapoorfilmcompany @saffron_bm @nikhildwivedi25 @abujanisandeepkhosla 
A post shared by Veere Di Wedding (@vdwthefilm) on Oct 24, 2017 at 2:34am PDT 
It's been months since rumours about Sonam Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan joining forces for a feel-good, all-girl film first reached the public. And the excitement over the pair working together hit a new high when the two stars shared the couch on Koffee With Karan's latest season. 
Most recently, Veere Di Wedding has been topping trending charts every time one of the upcoming movie's cast members have been seen flying to or from Delhi, where most of the film has been shot. And if you've been tracking them all, you'll be all too familiar with @VDWTheFilm, the movie's official Instagram account, which has been giving Bollywood fans sneak peeks into its making, and has already earned an impressive following of 16,000 users. 
If you're one of the many who have been waiting impatiently for more news on VDW, today is your lucky day! The movie's very first official sneak peek is now online, and if you love summery celebrations, you can't miss it. All happy shades of mango yellow, tangerine and lime green, the poster shares a glimpse of Sonam Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Shikha Talsania and Swara Bhaskar getting ready for what looks like a big, fat Indian wedding. 
Adding an element of mystery is the fact that though fans already know the film's leading ladies, the poster doesn't let them actually see the characters' faces too clearly. Who's the bride in this story, and what's the movie all about? You'll have to follow @VDWTheFilm for more updates. Spoiler: The festive sneak peek came captioned 'Mahurat out tomorrow!'. Stay tuned for more surprises!

We stand together 
It is something of a pleasurable ache. Slight enough was the impression it left on one's skin; a flighty tug of the nerves. It was, perhaps, the only kind of squeeze I truly coveted in my childhood. The phrasing varied between the playground at school and our little colony grounds back home, and across neighbourhoods in India. The essence was the same. It was something of a girly thing, or at least I remember it as particularly feminine. If you had anything at all in common with someone you encountered, perhaps you were wearing a similar shade of blue, or had worn the same T-shirt, or had the same style of shoes, you said “inch or pinch” or  “same pinch” or some variation of it while simultaneously pinching the person with whom you shared an attribute. The greater the surprise of the discovery, the more intense the pinch. It was the gestural equivalent of the exclamatory “ditto” or “me too”, a way of signalling, through touch, the elation of having something in common with either a friend or an acquaintance. I like to call the impression the pinch left on one's skin the “solidarity bruise”. 
This somewhat odd detail from a very Indian childhood came back to mind when I woke up on Monday morning to find my Facebook timeline flooded by status updates by my female friends with the hashtag “Me too”. I'd been out partying the night before, ringing in a feisty feminist friend's birthday, and though we'd discussed, even amid the festivities, the sordidness of the Harvey Weinstein case, I had no knowledge of Alyssa Milano's call to action to women around the world to use the two-word phrase as a status to “give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.” By the time I'd looked at my computer it was 10.30am, and my timeline was inundated by women testifying to their personal experiences of molestation, abuse, rape, catcalling, and sexual harassment. 
It felt like an implosion, and although it was difficult to stomach the deeply entrenched nature of gender-based violence, I couldn't disguise the sense of triumph I felt that women were speaking out, breaking the silence, so to speak, relieving themselves of the stigma through these articulations of solidarity. It was like a collective pinch, across class and timelines and beyond borders. We were united by our speech. What we all had in common was the feeling of being preyed upon, more often by men in positions of power. We had all known the taste of shame, the scent of our own fear, the chorus of derisive voices we had encountered when we'd dared to tell another, perhaps a relative or a caretaker, about the situation of our abuse, or the very tactile sense of internalised guilt. Those two words offered the opportunity for collective redemption. 
Despite the pressure of deadlines, I found myself impelled to add to this conglomerate of voices, to comment on friend's posts to express solidarity and, more importantly, to reassert the reality of the feminist sisterhood. A photographer friend brought up the “boy's club” as an intimidating force. I knew what she'd meant, having experienced first-hand its machinations, particularly when one of its own is accused of sexual misconduct. I was in my early twenties at the time, dealing with my own insecurities and self-doubts as a wannabe writer. I had been preyed upon by a male writer who was the moderator of the writing group I had joined when I was temporarily living in Goa. I would learn much later that abusers like him are also psychopathic bullies who manipulate you into some kind of complicity so you feel either too ashamed to make a fuss, or they keep testing the boundaries of your allegedly progressive attitude, so that if you call them out on their sexual language or for sending you links to filthy pornography, they accuse of you conservatism and hypocrisy. 
When I was in my twenties, I always felt like women who were in their thirties would chide me for my youth. “You're so young,” they would say, and I often felt offended, because I thought myself to be a lot more mature than most others my age. But now that I am in my early thirties, I understand more precisely what they were getting at. It's the fact that as a woman, your twenties are marked by the hot stigma of other people's opinions, the whole damn world's opinions. By the time you get to 32, you do, indeed, run out of** 
**s to give. You are not afraid to muddy the waters, cause a storm if you have to because you have been wronged, in other words, stand up for yourself. Before I was in that writing group, I tried my hand at being a theatre critic at a city-based magazine in Mumbai. And I remember having to interview a relatively famous theatre director. I was 23 then. We'd had good enough conversation, but when I was leaving he tried to kiss me. To avoid the awkwardness I turned my face so his lips barely grazed against my cheeks. When I went to see his play and the lights were turned out, I found him feeling me up. His wife and child were in the audience, I imagined, but he was shamelessly making moves on me, despite my lack of reciprocity. The 32-year-old me would have slapped his face, but the 23-year-old me drowned in the morass of confusion. Had I inadvertently sent him signals? Did I invite this? I was completely unschooled in how consent ought to be elicited in situations like these, situations where someone in power was using his quasi-celebrity status as a shield of invincibility, something that Lena Dunham explored so wonderfully in that bottle episode of the last season of Girls. 
I was lucky, however, that when I was in that writing group, I was surrounded by 30-somethings with a low tolerance for misogyny. What we shared, besides our intuition towards language, was this common abuser. It was time to ‘out' him to the rest of the group. We strategised so as to be as sensitive as we could. Our basic message was that someone like him ought not to be moderator, because he was using his position to prey on unsuspecting women. He had to be divested of power. There was an established pattern. We had proof of cyber harassment. What followed was a couple of harrowing weeks. Instead of extending empathy, the abuser's friends, and many other women in the group, too, defended him and made us out to seem like liars, like co-conspirators out to break up the group and disrupt its laconic cohesiveness. It was suggested by the more powerful members that the group be dissolved, especially since many of the male writers had begun to leave, out of solidarity with their abuser friend. But the real reason was so that the email archive could be deleted so no trace would exist of our rebellion. Our characters were besmirched, and, eventually, unable to face the hostility, one by one we exited even the new-old group. 
Notice how, even now, despite having a voice, having agency, despite being a weekly columnist with a renowned city tabloid, despite having authored a book, despite having some social media clout, I have not named either of my aggressors. Because I am still not totally fearless. Because I am not convinced that my testimony will be considered authentic. Because I have been failed before by the prevailing misogyny of the worlds I inhabit. Because, even though I do not see myself as weak, I can see how I can be perceived as vulnerable. Because I have dared to write what the industry refers to as erotica, have dared to speak of my body as a desiring being, have dared to speak about agency as an empowering thing, and have also dared to live alone in a city whose reputation as a rape capital is continually reinforced. Because all of that daring can and has been used against me before. Because my courage can also be my Achilles' heel. Because sometimes I am tired of always having to, as a woman, announce my victimhood and then try not to be undone by it. So, like so many of my peers I lick my wounds in private and vow to myself to be more of a bitch, to become more successful so that I seem like I can't be touched, so that, for a change, I may be perceived as too intimidating to mess with. 
It is the adverbial ‘too' that adds linguistic strength to this contemporary war cry, making it an admission not just of solidarity, but also of retribution. Maybe the time has come for women to no longer need to take refuge in complicitous silences. Maybe we are finally asserting the resounding power of our sisterhood en masse. Who is to say the future can't be female?

“I have lost my wife and kids, whom I love more than anything else.” 
As the scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein continues to grow, the embattled movie producer appears to be growing increasingly grave, showing none of the defiant tone that he displayed less than a week ago, when word first broke that multiple women would be accusing him of sexual assault. 
On Wednesday afternoon Weinstein provided a new statement to Page Six, responding to his wife, Georgina Chapman's, decision to end their marriage. “I am profoundly devastated,” he said. “I have lost my wife and kids, whom I love more than anything else.” 
Chapman, the fashion designer who has been married to Weinstein for 10 years, announced Tuesday that she was leaving Weinstein, hours after The New Yorker published a harrowing exposé in which multiple women accused Weinstein of sexual assault and, in three cases, of rape. Last week The New York Times published its own account of Weinstein's alleged assaults across several decades. 
Chapman said in a statement, “My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.” 
Weinstein told Page Six, “I fully support her decision. I didn't stand in Georgina's way when we discussed a separation, I encouraged her to do what was in her heart. I know she has to do what is best for the children, for herself and her business, she employs 130 people. I don't want her or my children to be hurt any more than they already have. I truly love Georgina, and I hope one day we can reconcile, although right now I don't know if that could possibly happen. 
“I apologize to everyone who has been hurt by my actions,” Weinstein told Page Six, although he said he believes that all of his encounters were consensual. 
“I realize I need to work on myself and to change,” Weinstein said. “I am in intense therapy and counseling. I don't know if I'm going to Europe for rehab; I really don't know where I am going.” 
TMZ also reported Wednesday afternoon that police responded to a 911 call at the Los Angeles home of Weinstein's daughter Remy, whom law enforcement sources said told police that her father was “suicidal and depressed.” Weinstein had already left Remy's home by the time police arrived, and TMZ reports that Remy told the police it was a family dispute, and that Weinstein hadn't made any suicidal statements.

From Masaba Gupta to your next-door neighbour, everyone's fair prey to this vicious beast 
Instant information. Instant entertainment. Instant communication. Instant shopping. Instant gratification. Instant attacking. Instant insulting. The internet has redefined life as we know it. While it has aided most first world countries in improving their already-developed lives and is helping them move forward, much like Frankenstein and his monster, this boon has also given birth to ‘trolls'. Forget cyber browsing, say hello to cyber bullying. 
When it comes to bullying, Monica Lewinsky knows what she's talking about. Lewinsky gained notoriety after then-President of the United States, Bill Clinton admitted to having had an "inappropriate relationship" with her while she worked at the White House in 1995-1997 and was subjected to endless media and public scrutiny after the revelation. She disappeared for a decade to escape the intense scrutiny, and remerged in June 2014 with an essay for Vanity Fair titled "Shame and Survival", wherein she discussed her life and the scandal. 
To expose the horror of cyberbullying and trolling, in 2017, Lewinsky started a #ClickWithCompassion campaign and released a PSA, a short film which shows actors confronting one another with real comments from the internet. These scenes are enacted in actual public places and in each scene, we see unwitting bystanders stand up for the victim, proving that the kind of hate that is an accepted reality online, definitely doesn't translate offline. 
So, what it is that gives the online troll license to terrorise people? Anonymity? Armoured by security their computer and smart phone screens offer, they seemingly spend their lives passing judgement on the lives of others—whether it's spewing vitriol at celebrities who have no choice but to live their lives in the public eye, or at an everyday Joe(anna) who falls prey to nasty comments. They seem content to spread hate with their words without fear of consequence, and we wonder if this clickable bile is all the menace they're capable of, or if it is only the first step of harassment? 
Whether it's famous or not famous people, the impact of trolls is significant. After the death of her father Robin Williams, Zelda Williams took a brief respite from Twitter and Instagram. The reason? Trolls who derided her, posting photoshopped pictures allegedly depicting Williams' body in a morgue. On the other hand, Jennifer Lawrence has publicly and repeatedly stated she'll probably never be on social media because the internet has so often ridiculed her (not to mention the time hacked nude images of the Oscar-winner made their way to the internet). Ariel Winter, the young star of Modern Family has an Instagram account, the comment section of which could traumatise and anger any young woman in equal proportions. Whether it's unsolicited advice on how a ‘young woman should dress', lewd comments on what people would like to do with her body parts, or commenting on her relationship status, trolls have never left any stone unturned when it comes to harassing her. And we're pretty sure, scrolling through comments on any celebrity's Instagram or Twitter accounts would open up a similar minefield of nasty comments. 
Closer home, Twinkle Khanna has just been subject to an ‘open letter' that takes ruthless digs at her personal life for opinions expressed via her columns, while actor Sunny Leone was at the receiving end of a truckload of insensitive comments after she adopted a baby girl from Latur. Just today, fashion designer Masaba Gupta went on Twitter to reveal that she was called names like "illegitimate west indian" and "bastard child", only because she expressed support for the firecracker ban by the Supreme Court. Being so active on social media, does she question putting herself out there when such situations arise? "I do. I'm constantly debating how much I should share. And how much I should ignore as well. But some things need to be done and sometimes ignorance is not the best policy. What I did [tweet support for the firecracker ban] was more for my own peace of mind and closure," Gupta explains. Does she have any advice for women who are targeted on social media? "Pick your battles," she says, "Not everything is worth responding to. But when you do pick what you want to fight for, then do it with grace and take it to its end. And once it's over, you can't let that affect you again. Small things build up to big problems emotionally and psychologically." 
While there are rare instances when internet commenters come to the defence of people (in the instance of Mithali Raj being trolled for wearing a spaghetti strap top, her supporters hit back at the trolls) and the defence of sanity (any comments on the inane statements made by Chetan Bhagat), the negativity that trolls spread has a much larger purview. The anonymity of the internet and the ease of hiding behind a screen seems to have given trolls the license to ignore the fact that their words have a lasting impact on the real people that their virtual comments are directed at. And it's a disappointing truth that in a slowly desensitised world, where hateful actions are rampant, humanity has found yet another way to make each other miserable.

It's a big day! 
When one of Bollywood's biggest (re: Amitabh Bachchan) legends turns 75 years old, you can expect the entire film industry to celebrate the milestone moment. While Ranveer Singh was one of the first to share a post dedicated to the star's birthday (his photo went up at 4AM this morning!), the rest of Bollywood have been filling their social media feeds with birthday wishes for the icon through the day. 
On Instagram, Arjun Kapoor celebrated Mr Bachchan's big day with a throwback of himself busting a move with the star, Dia Mirza put together a collage for the big moment, and Sophie Choudry shared her wishes with a snapshot taken at a Diwali party.

Captioned “Happy birthday Amit uncle… you are the hugest inspiration and continue to set the benchmark of brilliance,” the director's post earned more than 50,000 likes in less than five hours.

How Shilpa Shetty, Sridevi Kapoor and Raveena Tandon celebrated Karva Chauth 
October 8 marked the day of Karwa Chauth, and like every year, Anil Kapoor's wife Sunita Kapoor hosted a lavish party at their residence in Juhu. 
Kapoor is known to be a great hostess, and true to her style, the celebration was as grand as it gets, with some of her closest friends coming together decked up in their festive best. While Shilpa Shetty Kundra opted for a striking red, yellow and gold striped sari with a statement necklace, Raveena Tandon wore a bright pink and red salwar set, and Sridevi picked out a mint green sari with an embroidered blouse for the Karwa Chauth get-together. Others spotted at Kapoor mansion were Farah Khan Kundra, Maheep Kapoor, Bhavana Pandey, Kiran Bawa, Neelam Kothari, Lali Dhawan, Anil Kapoor, Raj Kundra, and Sanjay Kapoor. 
As the evening progressed, all the ladies took part in the Karwa Chauth puja and posed for some Insta-worthy pictures. Judging from the celebrations, it's safe to say that all the ladies had a blast. Shilpa Shetty Kundra also took the opportunity to post another one of her 'Sunday Binge' videos, giving everyone a peek into the lavish buffet spread, and enjoying a berry torte after breaking her fast. The night's highlights also included Raj Kundra's post for wife Shilpa, captioned " 🎶 Chand chupa iphone mean 🎶 😁 who needs to see a moon when I can see a star." Take a look at the Karwa Chauth celebration in our slideshow.

Whose party did Taimur Ali Khan just join Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan at? 
Just days after delivering her first child, a little girl, new mom Soha Ali Khan Pataudi celebrated her birthday with family and friends last evening at her Mumbai residence. 
Amongst the guests who stopped by to celebrate Pataudi's big day (and congratulate her and husband Kunal Kemmu on their family's newest addition), were of course, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan. 
While Saif walked in wearing an Audioslave T-shirt and shorts, Kapoor Khan worked a casual yet sleek vibe with a sunset-print Rag & Bone tee and breezy black trousers. What made the Khan couple's appearance at the celebration even more exciting: the fact that the duo were joined at the party by none other than their adorable (almost) 10-month-old son, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. 
All bundled up in dad Saif's arms (you can't ignore how similar the two look), Taimur crashed the birthday celebration twinning with his mom in baby blue, and even spent some time with the paparazzi under Pataudi's residence. It's no surprise that the pictures have already gone viral, as every one of Taimur's outings do. The baby became a social media celebrity almost immediately after his birth in December 2016, with some of his biggest moments so far including the first time we saw him try on a kurta, his very first international holiday with family, and also the time he visited his mom and aunt Karisma Kapoor at work. Can you believe this toddler's little pout and dreamy lashes? 
In case you missed it, this week has been a busy one for Taimur, and Kapoor Khan. Just yesterday, we spotted the mother-son duo at Mumbai airport, returning from Delhi where Kapoor Khan has been shooting for Veere Di Wedding (while the star dressed for comfort in a striped shirt dress and trousers, Taimur was seen fast asleep in a mint green shirt), and early this morning, the actor left the city once again for another work commitment. Heading to Dubai, Kapoor Khan made a statement at Mumbai's T2 in a mango yellow Gucci T-shirt, and the same black Birkin she carried to Pataudi's party. Check out more of Kapoor Khan's most memorable outfits in here.

Who joined AbRam Khan at Gauri Khan Designs this weekend? 
Ever since Gauri Khan finished putting the final touches on her brand new flagship space, Gauri Khan Designs has been brimming with stars. From Rani Mukerji, Sridevi and Karisma Kapoor to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Karan Johar and Sussanne Khan, the celebrity interior designer's friends have all made sure to stop by and check out her store, and congratulate her on her work over the past few weeks. 
This weekend, Khan had yet another busy day at GKD. The design pro was visited by none other than than Nita Ambani, and was also joined at the same time by her husband Shah Rukh Khan, and the youngest member of the Khan family, AbRam Khan. Khan made sure to thank Ambani for the visit with two Instagram posts, saying “Coffee and conversations at the #GKD store... Was great catching up with you, Nita!” 
Another star spotted hanging out at Khan's store this weekend was Ranbir Kapoor. The actor, whose house has also been designed by Khan, made sure to tell her fans just how talented he thinks she is with an Instagram video. Watch it now. 
This one is a must watch ... honest and so true ... hahahha .. thank you ... Ranbir ❤

Kareena Kapoor Khan Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi at airport 
In case you missed it, Kareena Kapoor Khan's schedule over the past few weeks has been incredibly busy. The star, who celebrated her 37th birthday this September, has been jet setting between Mumbai and Delhi while shooting for her next film, Veere Di Wedding, and more often than not, has made sure that she took her baby boy, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, along with her on her travels. The last time we saw the mother-son duo together at the airport, Kapoor Khan was cheering up a teary Taimur with hugs and cuddles at Mumbai airport's departure terminal. 
Last night, Kapoor Khan's fans got a glimpse at the two at Mumbai airport once again. While the actor opted for khaki trousers, red sneakers and a pastel blue shirt dress for her flight, Taimur came out right before her in a mint-hued shirt and beige bottoms. Almost 10 months old now, the dapper toddler looked adorable as ever bundled up in his nanny's arms, and managed to get shutterbugs clicking away even though he was fast asleep. 
If the rumours are true, we'll be spotted the Khans flying in and out of the city for a while longer. Kareena Kapoor Khan is still completing her schedule for Veere Di Wedding, and will soon be seen on the silver screen alongside Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar in the film. Can't wait for the film to hit theatres? Don't miss the latest behind-the-scenes moment to go viral from the film's sets, a hilarious video of the co-stars discussing the cheat meals they've just indulged in.

Kuch Kuch Hota Hai fans, this is for you 
Believe it or not, it's been 19 years since Karan Johar's debut film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai hit theatres. And almost two decades later, the romantic movie still counts as one of the director's most memorable works ever. That explains why Shah Rukh Khan's latest selfie, a cosy snapshot of himself between KKHH co-stars Kajol and Rani Mukerji, went viral just minutes after he posted it on his Instagram page. Shared on October 2, the star captioned his groupfie with this heart-warming comment: “Sum nites the stars with u shine brighter than the ones in the sky. Thx ladies for ur graciousness beauty & love.” 
Sum nites the stars with u shine brighter than the ones in the sky. Thx ladies for ur graciousness beauty & love.

But that's not all. What made Khan's post twice as special was the second half of his Insta collage, which featured some of his other leading ladies: Karisma Kapoor, Sridevi and Alia Bhatt. While Khan has shared silver screen space with Kapoor in the iconic Dil To Pagal Hai, he worked with Sridevi in action film Army, and was seen playing Bhatt's psychologist recently in Dear Zindagi. Seeing the star in one frame with some of his coolest co-stars had Bollywood fans everywhere liking, sharing and commenting. Want a closer look into the star-studded evening? Here's Kapoor's post from the get-together.

These unseen pictures of Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan are too adorable to miss 
While Shah Rukh Khan spends most of his time in the limelight, his wife, Gauri Khan, is a silent star. More often than not, the celebrity interior designer shies away from shutterbugs, making her red carpet appearances twice as special.

Here’s all we know 
Soha Ali Khan and Kunal Kemmu welcomed their first child, a daughter, into their family today. Kunal Kemmu took to Twitter earlier today to share the happy news with his followers, saying: “We are over the moon to share we have been blessed with a beautiful baby girl on this auspicious day Thank you for the love&blessings (sic)” 
We are over the moon to share we have been blessed with a beautiful baby girl on this auspicious day Thank you for the love&blessings 
— kunal kemmu (@kunalkemmu) September 29, 2017 
Kemmu had confirmed the pregnancy in April this year, in a text to a leading daily, stating, “Yes it's true... Soha and I are very happy to announce a joint production coming later this year - our first child! :) We feel blessed and thank you all for your good wishes (sic).” 
Ali Khan, 38, and Kemmu got engaged in July 2014 in Paris and tied the knot in Mumbai on January 25, 2015, in an intimate ceremony at the Khans' Mumbai residence. For her wedding, Soha Ali Khan chose outfits from designer labels Sabyasachi, Ritu Kumar and Sanjay Garg, amongst others (did you miss her bridal beauty tips?). The reception featured the Khans' and Kemmus' closest friends, including Karan Johar, Arpita Khan Sharma, Neha Dhupia and Konkana Sen.

Have you seen them yet? 
After finally confirming their relationship last November, and after almost a year of grainy paparazzi photos, marriage rumours and that Vanity Fair cover, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at last have their first official photos together. 
Coming during their first public appearance at an official event (at the Invictus Games in Toronto) the pair were spotted sitting together, laughing, and even sharing a few kisses—in other words, finally being a normal couple. 
Wearing a button-down white shirt (by Misha Nonoo), jeans and carrying a large brown tote bag, Markle looked relaxed alongside her Prince boyfriend, who was dressed down in a black polo and dark denim jeans. 
Watching the wheelchair tennis match, the couple even held hands, which as simple as it sounds is actually a big deal in royal world—public appearances such as these are usually considered ‘work' events, and displays of affection are discouraged. 
But as is the norm with Harry, when did rules ever get in the way of a good thing? 
Although some royal watchers believe marriage is imminent, others are saying its too soon for the couple who have only been dating for a year. Either way, we're guessing its the first of many Markle/Harry photos—something we're extremely happy about, if for no other reason than to copy Markle's cool-girl style.

Some of the biggest names in Bollywood were at the Vogue Women Of The Year Awards 2017 and if there was on celebrity who had everyone's attention, it was certainly Shah Rukh Khan. The star presented the award to Nita Ambani for Global Philanthropist and while he was escorting her back to her seat, host Archie Panjabi requested the actor to stay back with her on the stage. 
After completing his duties, Khan strolled back on stage and flirted with Panjabi commenting on her eyes and her dress. The banter went on for a while and Panjabi asked Khan if he would work on a movie with her. After he agreed to it, Panjabi also requested Karan Johar direct the movie and that Khan would come close to Panjabi and whisper the key dialogue from his hit Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in her ear. 
Not wasting a moment, Shah Rukh Khan walked over to the dais and complied with Archie Panjabi's request instantly. Clearly, the cult '90s movie remains as much a favourite amongst the stars as it is for the fans, and Shah Rukh Khan's ability to switch between characters proves he is the ultimate superstar of all times. Watch the video for more.

When Twinkle Khanna talks, everybody listens. Each time she makes a public appearance, she'll depart with words that'll leave you thinking. While she penned down a hilarious acceptance speech for Akshay Kumar at the Vogue Beauty Awards this year, she stole the show with an even better one, while accepting her Opinion Maker Of The Year award at the Vogue Women Of The Year last night. As she thanked Vogue for her award, she chose to share her 10 best learnings from the last decade with the room too—read them all here (and watch her in the video above). 
It's true that we get more comfortable in our skin as we get older, but that's because the poor thing is not as tight as it once used to be. We don't need GST on our sanitary pads, what we need instead is an alarm inside it. Not a vibrating one that'll set us off on a different path altogether. But an alarm nonetheless that warns us of imminent overflow and saves us the 100 trips we make to the bathroom just to check. Now that's a product I would want GST on. Millions of Indian women fast for their husbands' long lives every Karva Chauth. My dear friend who just won an award is immortalised in his movies, but I don't think our 3,033 Gods are really listening. Because on the mortality charts there are 147 countries above us where their men outlive our good old Indian dudes. So, ladies stop because it's clearly not working. This I had to learn the hard way: It's difficult to befriend the present if you're still quarrelling with your past. God could not be everywhere, so he created mothers and the Devil could not be everywhere so he created mothers-in-law. Having said that, I feel I'm going to be a terrible one. The only thing free in life is bad advice. Enough said. Botox unfortunately does not make you look younger, it just makes you look like you're part of a secret alien invasion, desperately, desperately trying to fit in with the youth. Our satellite only reached Mars because it was called Mom. I'm certain that if it was called Dad, it would still be circling the Earth, lost, but not willing to ask for directions. Nine, and the reason I'm standing here: Life is but a beautiful chance in the game of choice. The most important thing I have learned is this—for centuries, women have been looking for a cape and they've been handed an apron. And it's only recently that we've learned how to swing our aprons around, let it fly on our backs and take to the skies. Awards like theses validate our work and help us soar higher so I'm truly grateful to be going home with this one.

Natalia Vodianova is in town for a special reason 
The Vogue Women Of The Year Awards are just around the corner, and Vogue is welcoming supermodel and philanthropist Natalia Vodianova in Mumbai just in time for the ceremony. The founder of the Naked Heart Foundation and charity platform Elbi, is visiting Mumbai not only for the star-spangled evening but also to raise awareness. We chatted with the 'Supernova' about how she plans to spend her time in the city. 
Is this your first time in India? What are you most looking forward to? No, I've been in India back in my modelling days. One of these occasions was for an advertising campaign of the iconic perfume Shalimar, from Maison Guerlain. I've interpreted a princess living in the most magical, dreamy and sensual atmospheres of India: an image of woman who's got so much in contrast with some of the most extreme conditions Indian women live in, that I got to see with my eyes, in the real India, after the shooting. I'm back today as a philanthropist and a most of all, as a woman, looking forward to being more and more in touch with this culture, knowing it deeper, in order to understand the best way I can, sensibly, involve myself in the most urgent aspects that can improve health and wellbeing of Indian women. The fact that a large percentage of women still have not access to tampons urges awareness and attention. As an investor in Flo—one of the most complete period tracker apps available in the market—I saw the opportunity to use technology to open up boundaries between cultures and give women and people all across the world better access to the same kind of information. The campaign I launched ‘Let's talk about it. Period.' is a call to break the taboo and spread as much as possible a free conversation about women wellbeing. I look forward to spreading this message, particularly among Indian women. 
As a philanthropist, what is the nature and purpose of your work? Fostering a spontaneous and genuine sense of goodness in people, cultures and brands. Forcing good or impose it for the sake of being good is a blind path, against the nature of good itself, and definitely not constructive. People, especially the youngest generations, are more and more aware of the many problems of our world: we need to prevent this to create an unbearable sense of guilt and helplessness which can flow into indifference and paralysis. I like to see my work as an offer of an alternative prospective, or as a gentle incitement to awake in people their own human sense of goodness. We all have it, but we are not always aware of its incredible and concrete power. I founded Elbi, a platform and an app with the main purpose of revealing to people that everyone counts and even a little, effortless actions can actually make a huge difference. 
What do you like most about being a part of the fashion industry? Coco Chanel once said, "A fashion that does not reach the streets is not a fashion." She meant it about the vision of designers to create a wearable style, but I love how perfect this quote is about the consciousness that the fashion industry has matured through the years. That's what most excites me about being part of this industry: using our influence, our knowledge, our creativity, our sensitivity, our power to drive a positive change. I love to work with companies who make the most fashionable garments out of plastic waste, with brands who have a mature vision of how their work impact onto the world, I admire the courage of designers who put fashion to the service of real problems, reaching people lives, offering a new way of thinking and living. 
How would you describe your relationship with fashion? Mutual. I gave it all to fashion. All of my tears and fears when it divided me from my family in Russia. All of my energies when it spun me around the world, I literally gave my face to the many brands who identify their values in me. But I owe to fashion the most of my achievements in life, it's an industry that grows you stronger every day. Elegance thought me sensitivity. Beauty taught me altruism. Smiling taught me power to communicate. And it's still a mutual relationship today whenever I call up for a fundraising event or a charity project, having the highest personalities of fashion, the most incredible creative talents and the most conscious brands, joining forces to support my causes. And give out the same enthusiasm to the causes of my colleagues committed to other honorable purposes. My Elbi app, which promotes philanthropy in the daily life through simple digital gestures, offers rewards to those who support fundraising for different charity's causes spending Love coins on our Love shop: there you'll find several fashion brands who made their products available for this purpose. Recently Elbi and H&M have partnered up in order to convert H&M loyalty points into Love coins to be spent on our shop. That's exactly what I mean for a mutual relationship. 
What do you most love about being a mother? Being a child. I love how easily my children can take me back to my childhood and fill my heart with play and joy. There is nothing else able to lighten my life from the rest such as being with them, doing the simplest things on earth. I borrow their eyes to see the world and I'm so thankful I can still have that prospective. It's my secret to stay young. And teach of them is a deep source of inspiration for my projects and my philanthropic commitment. Those five little cuties are some of the most inspiring people in my life. 
What do you think the world needs more of? Sensitivity. Sometimes attention, care and listening are the most precious virtues of us humans. Without them there is no further step towards love and creative beauty.

All her updates from the event 
Whether she is travelling to Jordan to meet refugee Syrian children or attending the 2017 Emmy Awards in Los Angeles in a scene-stealing white gown, not a week goes by without Priyanka Chopra making the headlines. 
The Bollywood actor, who, as a Global Goodwill Ambassador of the UNICEF family has been working towards the causes women and children's education, is currently in New York and took to her social media accounts to post updates straight from the United Nations General Assembly being hosted in the city. During the event, the Chopra met the youngest-ever Noble Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, and both had a little fangirl moment with each other.

Oh @Malala no words will be enough...I can't believe I..met..U!!You're just a young girl with so much heart..and such achievements.so proud. https://t.co/0S4IlkTNJ6 
— PRIYANKA (@priyankachopra) September 20, 2017 
In another heartfelt post on Instagram, Chopra applauded the Malala Yousafzai's efforts in inspiring and empowering women all over the world. In her caption, she said: 
“I could write a novel about how smart, incredible, inspiring, encouraging and funny this young woman is...but I will keep it brief. Malala, you are an undeniable force to be reckoned with. The world knows that. You are a role model to all the girls and boys that want to make this world a better place for the future. Spending a few hours with you and your incredible father Mr. Yousafzai (who reminds me so much of my father), I realized you're also just a young girl with young dreams. Your jokes, Your love for Hindi Films, your infectious laughter will always remind me of what a huge responsibility you have taken on at such a tender age. I'm so proud to know you my friend. You inspire women like me all over the world. Can't wait to speak to u in our secret Hindi/Urdu again.”

How Kareena Kapoor Khan’s closest friends are celebrating her birthday 
September 21 marks Kareena Kapoor Khan's 37th birthday. And though the superstar has been busy hopping flights from Mumbai to Delhi for events and the shooting of her upcoming film, Veere Di Wedding, her nearest and dearest have already stepped into party mode, loading up their Instagram feeds with posts celebrating her big day. 
While early bird Rhea Kapoor shared her post for Kapoor Khan on the eve of her birthday last night, BFF Amrita Arora Ladak was amongst the first few to wish the actor on social media this morning, with a picture of herself giving Kapoor Khan a big kiss. Karan Johar was another friend who began Kareena Kapoor Khan's birthday celebrations early, posting an unseen throwback with the actor two days ago, and saving another special throwback for his feed today. 
Among the sweetest birthday wishes Kapoor Khan has received so far, however, has got to be the one shared by her agent, Poonam Damania. Captioned “Happy birthday my darling Bebo… there isn't one like you in this universe, love you to the moon and back… gorgeous inside and out… 10 years and counting,” this is one post you cannot miss.

You’d want to take this one home 
As you probably know by now, this year marks Vogue India's 10th anniversary. To commemorate this milestone moment, we are hosting the first ever Vogue Women Of The Year, an award ceremony that spotlights and celebrates all the strong, independent, fierce women (and men) who have broken glass ceilings and have inspired us with their work and contribution to the society. 
No award ceremony is complete without a trophy that you would want to take home, and we wanted to make sure we created a keepsake worthy of its awardees. We spoke with Vogue India's creative director, Jolie Wernette-Horn, who told us everything to know about the covetable memento. 
What were your thoughts while designing the Vogue Women Of The Year trophy? When I was told we needed to work on a trophy for Women Of The Year, the letter V for Vogue immediately popped into my head. I pressed the two Vs against each other to create a tension, almost kinetic feeling. 
Where did you draw your inspiration from? Design-wise, there is nothing chicer than the Vogue logo. So, I made this trophy based on its typography. Using the font Didot, the contrast of thick and thin creates an elegant yet authoritative voice. 
Tell us the one thing that is special about the trophy? This is our first serious foray into three-dimensional design and we couldn't be happier with the final result.

Ravish Kapoor talks about the thought behind the design 
The countdown for the first-ever Vogue Women Of The Year (WOTY) awards has officially begun. With the ceremony inching closer, the excitement at our office is reaching peak as we are busy prepping for this exclusive, invite-only award ceremony that celebrates strong, independent, fierce women and men from different spheres of life, to be held on on Sunday, September 24, 2017. 
Fresh off the press today are the Vogue Women Of The Year invites, designed by Ravish Kapoor Innovative Invitations. The brand, named after its founder, is a celebrated name in the field of couture invitations, having designed wedding invites for several Bollywood A-listers—think everyone from Shahid Kapoor to Hrithik Roshan. We chat with the designer who has created the invites in close collaboration with our creative director, Jolie Wernette-Horn. 
How long did it take you to design the WOTY invite? Ravish Kapoor: Generally, it takes about three weeks for any customisation, but we created the WOTY card in just a week as we have an understanding with Vogue India, which makes it easy for us to create something special for them even in a short while. 
What inspired you? Jolie Wernette-Horn: We found out that tin and foil are the traditional materials for a 10th anniversary. Using this as a reference point, I was also inspired by Andy Warhol's 'Silver Clouds' installation, which is simply a room filled with silver balloons. So, I've used silver foiling for everything from the invite to the cover of the 10th anniversary issue. When looking for design references, I find that the most innovative and chic invites come from fashion shows. RK: We have kept the design minimalistic but yet glamorous at the same time. 
A standout detail from the WOTY invite? JWH: The invite is in the shape of a longer rectangle, which I find very elegant. The back is completely covered in silver foil with the Vogue logo debossed on it to create texture and shadow. The envelope again is all silver foil to reflect the theme. RK: We went with the ‘less is more' philosophy for this one. I went with a very simple design with straight lines, giving a glossy effect for an added touch of glamour. To make it a little more dramatic, the cover opens with four shimmering flaps. 
As we gear up for the super exclusive #VogueWomenOfTheYear awards, here's a quick peek at the sleek invite by @ravishkapoorinvitations with inputs from Vogue India's creative director @jolieraewh 
A post shared by VOGUE India (@vogueindia) on Sep 18, 2017 at 5:46am PDT 
What font was used for the invite? JWH: The font Didot was used for this as it is the base font of the Vogue logo. Again, I chose the colours based on the traditional 10th anniversary materials—silver, white and black. 
What were your thoughts on designing an invite for such a big occasion for Vogue? RK: It's always a pleasure working with Vogue and this was an extremely challenging yet an amazing experience. The invite itself needed to represent the power and simplicity of the women and we have tried our best to showcase that. JWH: I wanted to keep the design simple and uncluttered, to reflect the design I've set for the magazine itself. Also, it was important that the invite, and the overall vibe of the event, was not retro or vintage. There is a futuristic quality is silver foiling and gives a feeling of looking forward. 
What does Vogue mean to you? RK: Vogue simply means luxury and style. 
Vogue Women of The Year awards will broadcasted live on Facebook on Sunday, September 24, 2017, and will be televised on Colors Infinity soon after. Follow our social media handles and the hashtags, #VogueWomenOfTheYear and #WomenVLove, for day-to-day updates

Here's our Vogue Women Of The Year checklist 
The Vogue team is gearing up for one of the biggest award ceremonies this year—the Vogue Women Of The Year awards. Amidst the banter about planning outfits to wear to the event, we asked staff members what they plan to carry in their handbags. Take your cues from the team if you are planning to attend a similar event. Here are all the answers! 
Anaita Shroff Adajania, fashion director Party Smart, because it's going to be a fabulous night. 
Jolie Wernette-Horn, creative director My cellphone, just so I can get a selfie with my favourite celebrity (whose name we can't give away just yet!). 
Priyanka Khanna, associate fashion features director A piece of dark chocolate. I'll need the sugar rush to keep going! 
Renuka Modi, managing editor Gel pads for your feet so you can run around in your heels with an added touch of comfort. 
Divya Jagwani, bookings editor Battery pack, because you will have to talk to people before they come to the awards. Mint, because you will have to talk to people when they are there. Lipstick, because you need to look good when you talk to people. Perfume, because need to smell good when you talk to people.

Family throwbacks and milestone moments 
Last week, Bollywood put up some adorable family moments on Instagram. 
While Gauri Khan shared an adorable throwback featuring Shah Rukh Khan, herself and their puppy, Lisa Haydon posted a sun-kissed snapshot of herself enjoying a day off with sister Julia Haydon, Neetu Kapoor put up an old photo of herself with husband Rishi Kapoor, and Bipasha Basu uploaded a hilarious Boomerang of herself busting a move at home with her sisters. Another unmissable snapshot from last week: Shahid Kapoor's latest picture of daughter Misha Kapoor, who just got her ears pierced. 
The week also gave stars a chance to share some of their best travelgrams. Don't miss Alia Bhatt's cosy Srinagar album, Salman Khan's group shot from the Dabangg tour featuring Jacqueline Fernandez and Sonakshi Sinha, and Parineeti Chopra's picture-perfect surfer girl moment in Queensland.

With Vogue India's first Women of The Year awards looming closer, we understand you may have some burning questions that you're just dying to have answered. 
Luckily for you, the ever efficient Vogue India team has pre-empted and are on top of all your questions, before they've even been asked (yes, we are that efficient). 
Here are a few questions you may have about this massive event—let us know if you have any more. 
1 
When are the Women of The Year awards? September 24, 2017. (Don't forget to wish us a Happy 10th Birthday!) 
2 
Who is attending?  We're being extremely careful about not letting this information out, but you can find out a minute to minute update on the who's-who in attendance through all our social media platforms the evening of September 24. 
3 
Are there any international celebrities attending?  This is Vogue. Aren't there always? 
4 
Who's hosting the awards?  Hint hint: you will find your answer within questions 3 and 4. She's fabulous. We promise.

We asked some of the founding members of the magazine 
If we haven't made the birthday announcement quite clear just yet, Vogue India officially turns 10 this October. We are looking forward to celebrating the milestone moment with the biggest event organised by Vogue India till date—the Vogue Women Of The Year awards, which shines the spotlight on deserving women achievers in various spheres. 
For months, the Vogue India offices have been busy organising and planning the evening and each member on the team has taken it up as a special mission. Spending an entire decade in the same company is not an accomplishment many can brag about, and nothing spells commitment like being with the organisation since its inception. We rounded up some of the oldest names on the masthead about their journey with Vogue India and why the awards will unlike anything you have seen before. 
ALEX KURUVILLA, managing director, Condé Nast India 
What has your 10-year journey with Vogue India been like? It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start a company like Condé Nast and launch an iconic brand like Vogue in India. It's been one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences of my life. Who would have imagined that the world of media would see such dramatic disruption? We set out to create a magazine business and ten years later look where we are—websites, Instagram, Facebook, digital video, TV shows, a first-of-its-kind weddings business and marquee events like Vogue Beauty Awards and Fashion's Night Out and coming soon… the WOTY Awards! 
What are you looking forward to at Vogue Women Of The Year? This has been in the works for a while now. But there couldn't have been be a more opportune moment—the celebration of Vogue India's 10th Anniversary! I am looking forward to being with the amazing team who made this magic happen and to toast them for their incredible achievement. Without an audience, there would be no Vogue. WOTY will be as glamorous, entertaining and power-packed as the brand is! 
How has Vogue India changed the fashion scene in the country? I live in an all-women household and work in a virtually all-women workplace. I am proud of that. That's the kind of environment that sensitises you to women's issues and inspired me to produce a PSA like Boys Don't Cry as a #VogueEmpower pledge. When I look around, I think how much girls' mind-sets have progressed in India and how much boys are lagging! 
  
ARJUN MEHRA, publishing director, Condé Nast India 
What has your 10-year journey with Vogue India been like? It's been a truly fascinating and fulfilling journey for me. Over the years, almost every day, I have experienced what the power of a global brand can really be. Vogue India opens doors everywhere and evokes respect from virtually everyone. I feel privileged to be part of the launch team and so proud of what the talented team has accomplished. 
How has Vogue India changed the fashion scene in the country? I believe Vogue India has played a great role in bringing forth what is the best of Indian and international fashion to the reader in a relatable way and will continue to do so—through its magazine, digital and event touch points. 
What are you looking forward to at WOTY? I remember the incredibly stylish launch event in Jodhpur at the Umaid Bhavan palace like it was yesterday. Time has flown by and we hope to have an equally magical 10-year anniversary celebration. 
  
PRIYA TANNA, editor, Vogue India 
What has your 10-year journey with Vogue India been like? The last 10 years have been life altering, life changing and life consuming to say the least. I was features writer, a newspaper journalist, perhaps not the obvious choice for the editor of Vogue, but when I did get the job I was thrilled, I had such a wide-eyed wonder about it. In the last 10 years, it's completely changed my perception of what Vogue means. Today it means so much more—a voice, not just your ability to access the best of clothes but to use clothes as a tool of empowering yourself. It's come to mean individualism, chasing passions, chasing excellence, it's come to mean what the multi-hyphenate urban woman stands for today. For me this journey has been incredible. From taking up a designation and a job to owning and presenting a way of life that you ascribe to your readers. It's so much more than just a magazine to those of us who work here. We see it as a tool to communicate to women through the filter of fashion, which is the core of our brand. 
How has Vogue India changed the fashion scene in the country? 10 years, 120 issues, add to that events, digital, video, brand solutions, custom solutions—it's filled with so many memories. I almost feel like each day comes with its own set. But to me the single most overriding joy has been to see the power of what a great brand can do. How much easier it is to bring across our message to the women because they trust you and what you represent. I get to connect with an amazing bunch of women, who read the magazine, who work with magazine and those who we feature in the magazine. There's an implicit trust that they have in me because of the brand. 
What are you looking forward to at WOTY? The morning after, when I can sleep. Just kidding, I think I actually have butterflies like a nervous schoolgirl. I just want everything to be hitch-free, glitch-free. More than anything I want it to tug at the heartstrings because it is really an evening that honours truly incredible women achievers who, like our anniversary theme suggests have had fabulous style, fabulous lives, fabulous stories, irrespective of any boundaries. They've all chased excellence and held on to what they believe in, have all done it with unique inimitable style. To think of a room filled with such women is already giving me goosebumps. 
  
ANAITA SHROFF ADAJANIA, fashion director, Vogue India 
What has your 10-year journey with Vogue India been like? It has been amazing to be a part of a very evident fashion evolution that is synonymous with Vogue India's growth in these ten years. I have had the opportunity to associate with incredibly talented and distinguished individuals from the global fashion scene. You see, the whole game got elevated when we spearheaded the shift from local to international and encouraged a marriage of ideas, concepts, and inspirations. And yet we made sure that we retained our Indian identity and enjoyed a mutual respect with all our collaborators. Internally, I've have always had a fabulous support system who have been super-creative, inspiring and have always encouraged me to be me. I must digress here and tell you that even today, even after 10 years, I still get as excited with every cover shoot as I did with the first! 
What are you looking forward to at WOTY? As a magazine for women, it is very important for us to recognise and admire women who make a difference. And it's not like these women need any form of validation from us, rather we truly want to celebrate their achievements. In doing so we hope to encourage many more individuals to be influenced positively and hopefully make beneficial changes as well. We have curated this list and hand-picked various women (and a few men!) after much deliberation. 
How has Vogue India changed the fashion scene in the country? Dramatically and I'm so happy for this! Ever since I started off, we've promoted individuality. The whole idea of understanding fashion and then making it your own is something I've always subscribed to. Today, the younger generation has a louder, individualistic voice. They have pride in Indian style; I'm overjoyed that the sari is having a huge revival across ages. We have always given our readers the perfect blend of homegrown and international fashion, encouraging them to make it their own. If you look at the pattern this past decade has followed, this is exactly what has happened. 
  
PRIYANKA KHANNA, associate fashion features director, Vogue India [#image: /photos/5ce43d101dc26777a2c7a0b8]||| ||| 
What has your 10-year journey with Vogue India been like? Serendipity. The one word I would use to describe my journey at Vogue. Nearly 11 years ago, I moved back to India after working at Hearst Magazines in New York, and I happened to be sitting opposite Alex Kuruvilla at Mumbai's Taj Sea Lounge. A few days later, I had my interview with him and Nicholas Coleridge by the poolside (believe it or not, one of the first tasks he gave me was to find an architect for our office. I'd come into the office back when there were still pigeons living in it). Surprisingly, I started out at Vogue India working in the PR and events department but Priya had just been appointed as editor-in-chief, I knew Bandana via a common friend, and I knew Anaita as well, so I started helping them out on editorial projects and I realised this is where I wanted to be. 
The greatest thing about working at a start-up is that you really get to experience it all. From working on the first ever Miss Vogue, to putting together the Little Black Book, a hidden secrets guide (that found me spending a lot of nights in office in my PJs!) to meeting designers I had only read about, interviewing Karl Lagerfeld under the Eiffel Tower, to attending an Oscars viewing party and watching fashion shows at the Trevi Fountain, it's been quite the trip. After all, how many people can say they've helped launch a Vogue? 
But what's been the most incredible part of this decade has been the friends I have made along the way. I've been lucky to find some of my closest friends at Vogue, smart, accomplished women who have taught me a great deal. 
In the last decade, I've gotten engaged, married and had my first baby—so in many ways you could say I've grown up at Vogue. And what a place to be!

Here’s everything you need to know 
It that time of the year again. The Emmys are back, and putting our country on the global map once more is our September cover girl Priyanka Chopra, who, after visiting Syrian refugee camps and unprivileged children in Jordan via the UNICEF, will be making her way to Los Angeles to attend the 69th edition of the television awards. 
Even though the star, who plays Alex Parrish in a American political-thriller Quantico, hasn't been nominated for an award this year, she will be presenting at the Emmys alongside a list of famed actors. Chopra will be joining Big Little Lies stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley and other A-listers such as Matt Bomer, Adam Scott, Viola Davis, Gina Rodriguez and Sarah Paulson, among other note-worthy presenters. 
The Emmy Awards 2017 will be hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert and will be held at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. 
While the Bollywood actor wowed everyone in a crimson Jason Wu number at the 2016 Emmy Awards, we wonder what Chopra will step out in this year. 
The 69th Emmy Awards will air live on Star World, Star World HD and Star World Premiere HD at 5:00am on September 18

Acid Attack Survivor Posts Makeup-Free Selfie to Give Others Hope 
The no make-up movement means different things to different people. Some folks post selfies with no make-up to show that they are perfectly comfortable in their own skin without putting on foundation and highlighter, and that's great. Other people eschew beauty products for health reasons, because they'd prefer to have as little on their skin as possible. Others still sometimes go makeup free to make a point, and in that group is Resham Khan, a 21-year-old girl from Manchester who posted a make-up-free selfie lately for a reason that you'll want to hear. 
On her birthday this year in June, Khan was attacked with sulfuric acid and suffered burns to her left eye, face, shoulder, arms, and legs. Her story gained traction after a friend of hers created a GoFundMe page for folks to donate to Khan to aid her recovery. Khan has been documenting her recovery on her blog and recently wrote a post about getting ready to celebrate Eid al-Adha. In the process, she decided to wear a full face of makeup. Though the results were gorgeous, Khan revealed that the process hurt quite a bit and there was a lot she couldn't do because of the damage to her face and the healing that still needs to occur. 
She wrote, "In terms of applying make-up, it has become so much harder. It hurts a little to apply, and I found applying eye make-up a bit of a struggle so didn't do too much. I miss being able to have fun with shadows and liner. And my heart longed for a pair of fake eyelashes. But with time and the help of my doctor, I hope one day it's achievable." Hopefully, with more time to heal and the help of doctors, applying makeup won't cause her pain anymore and will only bring her joy. 
She also spoke to others who may be dealing with healing from acid attacks, saying she didn't want them to be discouraged by what they see on social media. "Make-up did a great job and so did angles and an edit. But please don't see my photos and go into despair or try to achieve something that may not be possible. It's hard. I've loved the compliments but the harsh reality is it is not real. It's been lovely, it's been great, but I can't keep pretend to be someone I'm not." While it's true that Khan looks fantastic in her Eid al-Adha look, it's also a good dose of reality for everyone to hear that most things we see on social media are heavily edited.

Rohit bal and Princess Diya Kumari come together to support For Ability India Trust 
Born from the personal experience of Piya Bajwa, the For Ability India Trust not only aims to serve the differently-abled but also works towards empowering the women of Rajasthan. To this end, the Trust will be hosting Nobility for Ability, a charity fundraiser at the City Palace of Jaipur on November 17 and 18. November 18, 2017, marks the 289th Foundation Day of Jaipur, and the evening will be celebrated with ace designer Rohit Bal presenting a couture show and Princess Diya Kumari of Jaipur acting as the patron of the Nobility for Ability event. The two-day affair will also witness a charity polo match between the Australian and Jaipur polo teams. 
The For Ability India Trust is focused on generating awareness about the disabilities faced by children and the various community programmes created by the Trust in a bid to elevate their quality of life. Piya Bajwa, the founder of For Ability India Trust, explains, “I have picked up these causes as they are deeply rooted in my life. We get so worked up [in our own lives], so I wanted to take a step forward and do something for the society I feel so passionately about." 
The event will also be supporting the Princess Diya Kumari Foundation (PDKF), which aims at empowering the girl child, and KnowDisability, an initiative that helps the differently-abled live an empowered life. “I know Piya Bajwa for a very long time now," says Kumari. "She is a very old friend and she is the one who decided to do the event to help the disabled people. My foundation PDKF in Jaipur helps the women of Rajasthan live a better life. We teach them sewing and skills to help them become independent. And we are doing it on the 289th Foundation Day of Jaipur so it's very special to us. The idea behind it is to raise funds through this event to help the less fortunate live a better life.” 
Couture wear designer Rohit Bal, has been keen to do his bit for the community for several years now. The perfect opportunity arrived when he was asked to be a part of this fundraiser event. “I honestly feel we get so cosy and busy in our own lives and professions that we tend to forget the more important things, that is trying and doing something for lesser privileged or physically challenged people. There are millions who are suffering in our country, especially the children. So whenever an opportunity like this comes, I would never say no to it. It's wonderful to be working with Princess Diya Kumari. Through this, we are trying to raise funds to help the people live a better life. I am a designer, so the best way that I can help is by doing a show and creating a couture collection. As the show is going to be held at the royal City Palace, the collection is going to be in sync with the ambience and the feel of the palace. The pieces are going to be about royalty, grandeur and heritage, so we are trying to add some elements of Rajasthan. The collection will be a mix of my classics and newer pieces inspired by Rajasthan," says Rohit Bal. 
The Nobility for Ability event will be held on November 17 and 18 at the City Palace, Jaipur

Here’s everything you need to know 
Ever since their fairytale wedding back in 2011, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Catherine, have quickly risen to the top of the world's most loved couples list. Since then, the royal duo's family has also grown by two to include their four-year-old son Prince George, and then in 2015, their two-year-old daughter, Princess Charlotte. And now, the parents are all set to welcome one more baby into their home, Kensington Palace. 
An official statement released today confirmed the news about Kate Middleton's third pregnancy, saying, “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child. The Queen and the members of both families are delighted with the news.” 
[#image: /photos/5ce43e94b80311455c8f861f]||| ||| Image: Twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal 
The announcement then continued to share that Middleton is currently suffering from Hyperemesis Gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. She will therefore be unable to step out for engagements in the near future. Until we know more, here's a look back at the couple's firstborn, Prince George's cutest style moments.

Where are Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi off to? 
Each time Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi sets foot out of the house, it gets Bollywood fans all over the world talking. At just eight months old, he's already a social media star. And as it turns out, he's quite the jet-setter too. 
The last time shutterbugs got a snap of Taimur, it was just weeks ago when he set out for his very first international vacation with his parents. Wrapped in a white blanket, the toddler (then fast asleep), entered Mumbai's T2 in dad Saif's arms, and before we knew it, the internet was brimming with pictures of him enjoying the view from his hotel room in Switzerland. Barely back from the quick break, Taimur recently even joined aunt Karisma Kapoor on the sets of a photo shoot, and last evening, accompanied mom Kareena to the airport once again for another getaway (rumour has it the two are now in Delhi). 
What makes Taimur's latest travelgrams so exciting isn't just his OOTD (the baby has been spotted in everything from tiny kurtas to mini polo shirts), but also the fact that yesterday's outing gave Bollywood fans a closer look at Kareena's heart-warming love for her son. The second Taimur began to show discomfort in front of the cameras, his superstar mom flew in to save the day with cuddles and big smiles. Don't miss their pictures.

This is how they're reclaiming the night 
Living as a woman, especially a young girl in the country, comes with several terms and conditions. In movies and statements made by politicians, and things relatives say like it's no big deal, sexism is served with the same enthusiasm as ghee in your bowl of dal. From an early age, girls are at the receiving end of many 'well-meaning' statements like, ‘sit like a lady', ‘don't show your skin', ‘don't hang out with boys', ‘come home at a reasonable time' and ‘who are you going out with?'. By the time a girl hits teenage, everyone from judgmental relatives to concerned parents will have made it clear that living life on her own terms, or, in fact, being a member of the female sex, is invitation for trouble. 
Accounts of crimes against women in our country are many and painful to recount. Between corrupt officials and flawed civil protection, the rot lies in the mindset that ‘men will be men' and it is the woman who needs to save herself by not putting herself in a compromising position. 
Earlier this month, Varnika Kundu, daughter of senior IAS officer VS Kundu, was stalked, harassed and nearly abducted by Vikas Barala, son of Haryana-based politician Subhash Barala, and his friend in Chandigarh. Kundu took to Facebook to write a hair-raising account of the night, which helped escalate the authorities' response to the case. “I'm lucky, it seems, to not be the daughter of a common man, because what chance would they have against such VIPs? I'm also lucky, because I'm not lying raped and murdered in a ditch somewhere,” she says. While Kundu received positive response from most quarters, there were many who took to victim-shaming, with the "Was she drunk?" and "Why was she roaming unescorted?", and, of course, the "Why was she out so late in the first place?". 
These responses are not an aberration; shamefully, they're the norm in a case where a woman is involved. It comes naturally to blame the victim in any case where harassment is involved, but women on Twitter are having none of it. Following a comment from politician Ramveer Bhatti, who said, "The girl should not have gone out at 12 in the night. Why was she driving so late in the night? The atmosphere is not right. We need to take care of ourselves.", women took to Twitter to reclaim the after-hours with the hashtag #AintNoCinderella. 
In a nutshell, in Cinderella, the party stops at midnight—ergo, go home before your cab chariot turns into a worse-than-pumpkin tale of horror. But life is not a fairy tale, and women are posting selfies from bars, streets and cabs, alone and with friends, at all times after sundown, in whatever attire they please, with the hashtag #AintNoCinderella. The point they're trying to make is that for women to be safe, they don't need to be shut indoors. It is men who need to be taught that it is A-okay to let a girl mind her business, whatever time of the day; a no is a no; it is perfectly fine to keep it in your pants; and despite your haze of machismo, she didn't ask for it. Here are some of the best tweets from the hashtag.

Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh seem to have an eventful weekend together 
This week, Mumbai was taken over by Lakmé Fashion Week and as always, Bollywood was present in full strength at the event, whether on the runways as showstoppers or attending the shows from the front row. 
Amidst the fashion week fever, we spotted Ranveer Singh spending some quality time with Deepika Padukone. On Saturday night, after attending Manish Arora's fashion show, Ranveer Singh headed with Deepika Padukone to producer Ritesh Sidhwani's (of Dil Chahta Hai, Don, Dil Dhadakne Do, Baar Baar Dekho fame) birthday. Like every year, the producer's birthday celebration was quite the star-studded affair and was also attended by Priyanka Chopra, Karan Johar, Malaika Arora Khan, Farhan Akhtar, among other Bollywood A-listers. 
While Padukone and Singh haven't been seen together much since they brought in the actor's birthday last month, this weekend, the duo made some time to be with each other. In case you missed it, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh were also spotted the night before on a dinner date at a popular pub in Lower Parel. Padukone kept her look casual-chic for the evening as she stepped out in an embroidered Gucci tracksuit. Incidentally, she was spotted wearing the same Gucci number at the airport earlier this year. While the last time she opted for nude lips, this time around she picked a bold red lipstick and a sleek bun to make her look stand out even more. 
Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh will soon be seen starring together in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's next, Padmavati.

Independce Day 
Yesterday, India celebrated 70 years of independence with flags and patriotic posts, and Bollywood celebrities were no different. Your favourite actors channelled their love for the nation through their social media feeds, wishing their followers a Happy Independence Day. 
While Priyanka Chopra spread the joy with a cute Boomerang sporting a tricoloured scarf, Katrina Kaif spent the day with underprivileged kids at her mom's school. On the other hand, Salman Khan celebrated with a throwback picture with his brothers, Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan, decked up in the colours of the flag. 
Shooting away from home, both Akshay Kumar and Sonakshi Sinha posted heartfelt messages for their Indian fans. Varun Dhawan shot out a video joining Indian jawans in singing the emotional 'Sandeshe Aate Hai' from Border, while Sidharth Malhotra and Jacqueline Fernandez recited the National Anthem on the sets of Pro Kabbadi. The cutest Independence Day post had to be Aditi Rao Hydari's video with her cat, singing Vande Mataram for her fans. 
Look through our gallery for these and more wishes from Sonam Kapoor, Preity Zinta, Bipasha Basu, Ranvir Singh and Virat Kohli to their fans on Independence Day.

How Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, Aaradhya Bachchan and Misha Kapoor spent their weekend 
This weekend, Bollywood's most-loved children took over our Instagram feeds from all over the globe. 
For starters, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi returned to Mumbai after his first family vacation in Switzerland, dressed in a navy and yellow polo that perfectly matched mom Kareena Kapoor Khan's midnight blue travel outfit. The very same day, Lara Dutta was spotted at Mumbai's Terminal 2, heading out for a holiday with husband Mahesh Bhupathi and daughter Saira, and a sleeping Misha Kapoor found herself jetsetting to London for her first holiday with parents Mira Rajput and Shahid Kapoor. (Don't miss the latest pictures of the toddler playing with a football in a garden with her dad in our slideshow). 
On the other side of the globe, Aaradhya Bachchan stepped out for IFFM 2017 in Melbourne with mom Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, and even accompanied her for the hoisting of the Indian flag dressed in a shimmery white Manish Malhotra. And that's not where the excitement ends! Just days after the world got a first glimpse at Karan Johar's twins Roohi and Yash, we got a first peek at yet another Bollywood baby this weekend: Sunny Leone's adorable adopted daughter, Nisha. 
Amongst Bollywood's older kids, don't miss the stunning snapshot of Suhana Khan, photos of sisters Jhanvi and Khushi Kapoor celebrating mom Sridevi's birthday at Arth, and the latest photo of Akshay Kumar's son Aarav trying his hand at baking at home.

Drink it up 
Even just sipping on a green juice makes you feel good about the day ahead and like you've got it all under control, regardless if you blended the kale yourself. 
So doesn't it then make sense to try and grab that feeling and healthy outlook and incorporate it into all your routines? 
This is exactly the thought process that cousins Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez went through when developing their superfood-based skincare line, Youth To The People. 
The co-founders, whose grandmother paved the way for them decades earlier with her work in the professional skincare industry, believe there's no reason your skincare shouldn't combine the best of superfoods, science, cold pressed extracts and gentle preservatives - which is exactly what they've managed. 
“They're health conscious, they're knowledgeable consumers,” Cloyes says of the YTTP customer. “They care about what they are putting in their body and what they're putting on their body and they understand that there's a relationship to both. There are so many things that we can do topically but it really is about the way you treat your body inside and out.” 
With a streamlined approach to your skincare routine, YTTP consists of the five main products every one of us reaches for daily or weekly (the cleanser, moisturiser, eye cream, mask and serum) in 100% vegan formulations with no synthetic colour, fragrance, parabens or mineral oil in sight. 
“We cold press all our extracts, so we have a blend of kale, spinach, green tea and alfalfa - cold press just like the juices. Never heated so you get all of those antioxidants and phytonutrients, all the great things you're getting from drinking or eating it,” says Gonzalez of the brand's superfood mixed with science approach. “So naturally, you get all of those nutrients and antioxidants topically and then we combine it with a lot of our grandma's influences; those great cosmetic ingredients so that you're getting something that's truly effective and you're getting the best of both worlds." 
So what products do the cousins recommend you start with? Both agree their hero product, the cleanser is a must. Great cleansers really do grow on trees, so what are you waiting for? 
Youth to the People is now available in all Sephora Australia stores.

While Karisma Kapoor, Malaika Arora Khan and friends partied at Arbaaz Khan's birthday celebration, Alia Bhatt Instagrammed an adorable snapshot of herself enjoying a night in with her girl gang, and Athiya Shetty posted a picture from best friend Aadar Jain's birthday. Overseas, Sridevi shared a new snapshot of herself vacationing with Jhanvi Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra spent some quality time with her baby niece (which resulted in a must-see impromptu photoshoot of the two twinning in black sunnies), and Arpita Khan Sharma loaded up her feed with holiday pictures. 
This week also gave stars a chance to share some of the favourite throwback moments. Deepika Padukone celebrated eight years of Love Aaj Kal with a fun movie poster featuring herself and co-star Saif Ali Khan, Sonam Kapoor brought in Aisha's seven-year anniversary with a mini video from the film, and Karan Johar shared a picture of himself from nearly two decades ago. Looking to the future, Katrina Kaif shared a sneak peek of her look from upcoming movie Tiger Zinda Hai, and both Anushka Sharma and Jacqueline Fernandez got busy promoting  Jab Harry Met Sejal and A Gentleman respectively.

Check out what she said here 
It's no secret that Akshay Kumar has incredible comic timing, and Twinkle Khanna aka Mrs Funnybones has proved her chops with her wry, tongue-in-cheek observations in her columns as well as her two books. And the best of both came together on Wednesday night at the Vogue Beauty Awards 2017, when Kumar made his acceptance speech penned by Khanna, which left the audience (and now the internet) in splits. 
Among the many people who shared the video was photographer Atul Kasbekar, who called Khanna a genius (rightly so) for her hilarious writing. 
@mrsfunnybones is a genius... No really, watch/ listen to @akshaykumar speech here at d @VOGUEIndia beauty awards 😄https://t.co/52KwNhv9WQ 
— atul kasbekar (@atulkasbekar) August 4, 2017 
Twinkle Khanna was quick to respond, and it was all praise for her husband. 
Haha! It was all in his impeccable timing :) 
— Twinkle Khanna (@mrsfunnybones) August 4, 2017 
Apart from the fact that they're giving all us lesser mortals a major case of relationship envy, if this is a little teaser of what to expect from the power couple when they team up, their next project, Padman, is definitely one to watch out for.

“To my overpaid trainer, and my underpaid cook, a big thank you” 
You won't spot her on silver screens anymore, but Twinkle Khanna (aka Mrs Funnybones) knows how to pull a laugh out of the straightest of faces with her books, columns, and even her tongue-in-cheek Instagram captions. 
In fact, Khanna's wit is so unique, even superstar husband Akshay Kumar leans on his interior designer-writer wife's wise words when it comes to public speaking. Last night, the actor attended Vogue Beauty Awards 2017 to take home the award for ‘Most Beautiful Man of the Decade', and though Khanna didn't accompany him to the event, her presence was unmissable in Kumar's hilarious acceptance speech. 
“To my overpaid trainer, and my underpaid cook, a big thank you for helping me maintain this ‘Beautiful Man of the Decade' body which I have. Though part of the credit should also go to the fact that I did not have two carry my two children for nine whole months,” Kumar recited with a poker face to his laughing audience and award presenter Karisma Kapoor, following that up with “And thus my stomach did not have to stretch to elephantine proportions, and then deflate to a small paunch with stretch marks and saggy skin that no amount of dieting can eradicate.” As a cherry on top, Kumar left the stage saying, “It's time for me to wind this up because it's really not fair that I always reach home late, and I should not take anyone so much for granted. But before I leave I would once again like to thank my beautiful, talented wife,” with a mini bow, leaving the banquet hall in peals of laughter. You've got to watch it for the full VBA experience!

More sneak peeks 
UPDATE (July 28, 2017 1:00 pm EST): The upcoming Balmain x L'Oréal Paris collaboration is nothing short of exciting, and we've been waiting with bated breath for the past two months for a second hint at what's to come. Back in May, Olivier Rousteing shared a gorgeous preview on his personal Instagram, revealing multiple hues of matte and metallic lipsticks. Now, several weeks later, L'Oréal is teasing yet another sneak peek, this time, with a close-up shot. 
The brand posted a photo to their official Instagram page, featuring a gorgeous sparkly rose gold lipstick, appropriately called Confidence. The shimmering tube is just one of 12 new shades that will be hitting the market in September. If you're into the nude lip trend, you'll definitely want to be getting your hands on this one, as it adds a sparkly vibe to the classic look. Of course, the rest of the line will feature reds, pinks, plums, and berries—so no matter what your colour preference is, you're bound to find it in the fall.

UPDATE (May 4, 2017 9:00 am EST): After the big collaboration announcement yesterday, Olivier Rousteing posted a sneak peek on his personal Instagram of the upcoming Balmain x L'Oréal Paris lipstick line. We already knew the lipsticks would be in the popular Color Riche formula, but the finish and shades were a mystery—well, until now. 
From the looks of Rousteing's Instagram posts, the Balmain x L'Oréal Paris lipstick collection will come in several different finishes, including matte and metallic. There will also be a variety of reds, pinks, and purples. So no matter what your signature shade is, you're sure to find a hue to fits you. The only difference between this one and the one you've been keeping in your purse lately is the Kardashian's go-to designer helped create it. You'll still be able to shop it at your local drugstore, though. You can check out the first looks at the lipstick, which will launch in September below.

We may never be able to add a pricey Balmain dress to our wardrobes, but L'Oréal Paris is about to give us the best (and completely affordable) thing. The French label's creative director, Olivier Rousteing, collaborated with the beauty brand on a brand-new lipstick line. If you aren't familiar with the designer, Olivier Rousteing is the man with lust-worthy cheekbones behind some of the Kardashians's and Jenner's best dresses. He's even got his own crew with same familiar faces known as the Balmain Army. It includes models Gigi Hadid and Jourdan Dunn—just to name a few. With this in mind, this is arguably one of the most major beauty collabs we're seen so far for 2017. (Ok, maybe it's on par with the Becca x Chrissy Teigen palette.) 
This is the first time Rousteing has ventured into the make-up space—and he's doing it big. The lipstick line will come in the iconic Color Riche formula. (Did you know that one is sold every three seconds?) The French designer helped create three different color themes with 12 shades in total, Women's Wear Daily reports. 
Rousteing also picked the design of the Balmain x L'Oréal Paris lipstick tube and oversaw the advertising campaign for the line. “L'Oréal Paris and Balmain share the same strong vision of femininity and the same goal, to empower women and offer them diverse ways to express themselves,” Rousteing said in a statement to WWD. “With this collaboration, I'm thrilled to make this idea tangible for every woman around the world. 
Three shades from the dozen of new Balmain x L'Oréal Paris lipstick shades will be featured in a "jewel edition" that you'll be able to shop at Balmain stores. As for the others, the limited-edition lipstick shades will debut during the next Paris Fashion Week, which happens in September. Soon after, they will be available at select stores where L'Oréal Paris is sold. We reached out to the brand to find out if that includes those in the US and will update this post when we hear back.

What’s Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi up to with his parents in Switzerland? 
In case you missed it, new parents Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan left Mumbai on July 26 for their very first international vacation with son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. And if you thought the 8-month-old's pictures from the airport (all bundled up in a blanket in dad Saif's arms) were adorable, you're going to love his latest holiday snapshots. 
Matching with his parents in shades of blue, Taimur's first vacay family portrait from Switzerland shows him smiling at the camera while cuddled in his father's lap as mom Kareena leans in. And that's not all; the second photograph that's now doing the rounds on Instagram is one of Saif looking dapper in a black and white suit, giving the toddler a kiss against a backdrop of lush green hills, while the third shows Taimur gazing at the camera in his mom's arms. While the origin of all three pictures remains a mystery, it's safe to say this holiday album, like everything else related to Taimur, will take over your news feeds like wildfire.

Jolie opens up about life after Brad 
Angelina Jolie covers Vanity Fair's new issue, breaking her silence on her divorce with Brad Pitt. While Brad had his own tell-all with GQ in May, this is the first time Jolie has opened up about the split. 
In the interview, Jolie opens up about the struggles of the divorce, life after Brad and the difficulties of co-parenting their six children. 
“I think it's very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything's going to be all right even when you're not sure it is.” 
Jolie denies the rumours that her and Pitt's celebrity lifestyles led to the divorce. “Our lifestyle was not in any way a negative,” she says. “That was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children..They're six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I'm very proud of them.” 
Jolie and Pitt were together for 12 years, marrying in 2014, before Jolie filed for divorce last September. 
Jolie says in the summer of 2016, just prior to the divorce, “things got bad” – and then corrects herself. “I didn't want to use that word...Things became ‘difficult.'” 
Jolie says her six children have been “very brave.” “In times they needed to be,” she says, without getting specific. “We're all just healing from the events that led to the filing...They're not healing from divorce. They're healing from some...from life, from things in life.” 
“It's just been the hardest time, and we're just kind of coming up for air,” Jolie adds. 
In the interview, Jolie is asked if the communication has improved, as per Pitt's statements in his GQ tell-all. 
“We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.” 
Jolie and her six children have since moved out of the family home and into a $USD 25 million estate. “[This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we're all trying to do our best to heal our family,” she says.

The perfect city shoe 
In 2012, Nike debuted its first Flyknit product, the Flyknit Racer sneaker, in time for the London Olympics. The idea to knit a sneaker was to combine form and function in a sustainable manner (this technique reduces material waste by an average of 60 per cent as compared to the traditional cut and sew), and also mimic the snug fit of a sock. 
Five years later, their newest iteration, the Nike Free RN Flyknit 2017 Women's Running Shoe, is an extension of the original idea. The highlights? It contours to the foot, is feather-light, incredibly flexible, and still gives you enough support both on the treadmill and outdoors. 
How do I know? I tested them. While the rains in Mumbai had me running indoors, on a holiday in London, every morning I did the rounds of Hyde Park, all in the spirit of good journalism (and let's be in honest, in an attempt to workout all those Pimm's cups!). 
I can honestly say they are the lightest shoes I have ever worn. Surprisingly, though I've been running on and off for the last five years, these are the first pairs of Nike shoes, I've worked out in. And I'm an official convert. After many months of running indoors, I easily transitioned to both grass and pavement, and my tread felt lighter, and more weightless. I love the flexibility of the style. 
The added bonus—they multi-task, a must for busy mums like me. Post my workouts, they easily took me across the city, when I spent my days pounding the pavement (ie hit the shops, museums and restaurants). With their cool abstract burst of colours, they also added a pop to my always-black outfits, and hit all the boxes of cool athleisure.

Nimrat Kaur Beauty Evolution 
While Nimrat Kaur might not have multiple Bollywood films to her name, she's made her presence felt through her critically acclaimed cinematic roster. Her debut movie Peddlers made it to the Cannes Film Festival in 2012 as did The Lunchbox in the following year. We last watched her in Indian cinemas last year in Airlift alongside Akshay Kumar, a role she received positive reviews for. Besides, Kaur was also a part of the American television series Homeland's fourth season and starred in season 2 of another television series from the US, Wayward Pines last year. Through this time, Kaur's beauty looks off screen went from big, curly hair and thick foundation to blowouts and twists coupled with plenty of bright lip colours. We tracked her complete beauty evolution over the past five years—here's a look at them all. 
The early days Her first couple of public appearances in 2013 had her in curled hair and glossy pink lips. Come 2014 and Kaur had moved on to thick eyelashes and bold lip colours while her hairstyling choices included everything from poker straight locks to curled updos. For the year of 2015, Kaur took the neutral route when it came to her lips with multiple appearances in creamy hues of nudes and pinks. It was also the year of top knots, grand updos and messy, high ponytails. However, we can't deny that she claimed oxblood lips as her own, every time she stepped out in them. She also let her hair down on multiple occasions with parts of it pinned to the back and styled in her patent tight, large curls. 
Back to reality In 2016, while Kaur's make-up stayed true to her accentuated eyes and a statement bold or nude lip, her hair took the sleeker route. Think straightened styles, big blowouts and a return of the top knot. This year so far, the actor has taken to natural beauty on multiple occasions—we're talking no make-up, a fresh glow and her natural hair. However, she did whip out her tube of red lipstick when needed. 
Have a look at the gallery above for her beauty looks over the years.

40 times Mira Rajput Kapoor stepped out looking flawless 
As someone who is married to an A-list celebrity, Mira Rajput Kapoor likes to keep a low profile. Her Instagram account exists but is private, and she was rarely seen in public, and the only way we ever got a glimpse of her was in Shahid Kapoor's adorable social media updates. Recently, however, we've spotted a lot more of her out and about in Mumbai and at social dos, she's only looked flawless each time. 
Throw it back to July 2015 when Shahid and Mira got married, and you'll notice that kohl was the most prominent feature of her beauty look—it's also the one thing she always travels with in her bag. Besides her kajal, you'll notice that in each of her photographs, her skin always has a radiant glow. While it could be good genes, in an interview with Vogue, she also told us that loves kumkumadi oil, which is known to have skin-clearing benefits. 
Our Vogue Beauty Awards 2017 judge is a fan of the no make-up trend and believes that using less always looks better. We can't disagree—you won't spot her with a harsh contour or excessive colour or glitter on her face. Over time, she seems to have developed a liking for eyeliner; she's worn it for almost every appearance. However, when asked about her fail-safe beauty look, she prefers to stand by her trusty kajal and lip gloss. 
Check out the gallery above for a glance at her beauty looks over the years.

Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi looks cute as a button on his first family vacation 
Since his much-talked-about birth last December, we've seen Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi's very first family portrait, very first solo picture, and most recently, we even got a glimpse at the toddler's first outing for a birthday party too. 
The latest first to hit the internet last night: pictures of little Taimur all set for his first family trip overseas. Though rumour has it that Taimur did accompany mom Kareena to London recently, this vacation is most likely his first with both his parents. And given that the couple love escaping to Switzerland, it comes as no surprise that the family will probably be spending their time off in the Royal Gstaad Palace. 
All wrapped up in a white blanket dotted with red and blue anchors, Taimur had the shutterbugs clicking away while he napped in dad Saif's arms outside Mumbai's international airport. And as it turns out, Taimur wasn't the only Bollywood baby out and about last evening. We also spotted Shahid Kapoor welcoming wife Mira Rajput Kapoor and daughter Misha home after their mother-daughter trip (don't miss Misha's adorable scarf-style headband), Imran and Avantika Khan walking through the streets of Bandra with their three-year-old Imara, Sushmita Sen smiling for the cameras with daughter Alisah, and a glimpse at Shah Rukh Khan's youngest, AbRam, on vacation too. Catch up on all the kids in our slideshow.

Major throwback 
Firsts are always special, whether it's your first paycheck or the first time you fell in love. When we got our Vogue Beauty Awards 2017 judges to recollect the first beauty product they remember using, each of them went down a nostalgic trail. Here's what they had to say: 
Gayatri Oberoi “It was in my teenage years, around 15, when my mother finally allowed me to use a beauty product because she was really into home remedies. It was when I was auditioning for a lot of commercials, I think Chambor was one of the first beauty products that I tried because it had just come into the market at that time. And then M.A.C.” 
Karisma Kapoor “My grandmother's red colour lipstick.” 
Dr Malavika Kohli “My first memory with a beauty product is kajal, it makes my eyes look bigger and brighter and gives me a more open look” 
Adhuna Akhtar “I think my first memory with a beauty product would be when I started working in the hair industry. I played around with a lot of make-up and made my mom my model.” 
Diana Penty “Eyeliner. My mom taught me how to use it when I was in college, and I wanted to, you know, get into the, ‘Oh, I did some make-up on myself' [zone]. So, eyeliner.” 
Dr Harshna Bijlani “My mother's lipstick when I was five.” 
Karishma Manga Bedi “Me getting sunburnt in Goa, coming back home and my grandmother making a vatna at home for me and rubbing and slathering it all over me.” 
Mickey Contractor “Oh God, that was so long back! I think it was a frosted blue eyeshadow.” 
Pooja Hegde “It was mascara. My friend gave it to me and I was like, ‘What do you do with this? How do you use it?'” 
Pernia Qureshi “I don't have an exact memory but it must be my mom's lipsticks or something from her dressing table.” 
Mira Kapoor “I actually used a homemade face pack and loved it because I could make it and then put it on myself, although I was yellow after that.”

Attention all Sabyasachi brides, there’s a new couture collection for you 
Sabyasachi has become such a popular choice for brides that the brand has dedicated an Instagram handle just to share images of real brides on their big day. Having opted out of the couture week schedule, Sabyasachi Mukherjee now chooses to share his new collections through Instagram for a democratic, all-access unveiling of the new line. All of last week, the designer shared teasers for his upcoming autumn/winter 2017 couture collection and jewellery line, that was finally revealed last evening. 
The designer scoured through the lanes of Thiruvananthapuram, Coimbatore, Lucknow, Hyderabad and Patiala to source pieces of vintage jewellery with exemplary craftsmanship that is hard to come by today. These were then painstakingly reproduced by artisans of the Sabyasachi Art Foundation. The line is broadly divided into Fine Jewellery (gemstones and diamonds), Heritage Jewellery (inspired from jewellery of Colonial India), Jadau, Vintage India (temple jewellery) and Men's Jewellery. Naturally, given the designer's homogenous aesthetic that only evolves and never changes from season to season, the collection would look best paired with his couture line. 
This season, the bridal couture follows broad themes titled ‘Devi', ‘Gulkand' and ‘Minimalist-Maximalist'. Aside from the show-stopping ornate trademark Sabyasachi lehengas, the collection offers Kanjeevaram tissue saris reminiscent of Raja Ravi Verma paintings. It's clear that the collection addresses the needs of both the bride and the bridal party, including menswear. The exhaustive collection that evokes a sense of nostalgia can be seen on the brand's Instagram handle, or better still, go through our slideshow here.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s beauty evolution 
There aren't many people in the world who haven't heard of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan before—she's been making waves internationally since 1991—she won an international model hunt by global modelling agency Ford and was featured in US Vogue before crossover stars became commonplace. The former model and Bollywood actor then went on to win the Miss World title in 1994 and subsequently made her Bollywood debut with Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya opposite Bobby Deol in 1997. 
Although she starred in a couple of movies since then, the film that really put her on the map was Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam in 1999 with Salman Khan, which was followed by other critical and commercial hits like Mohabattein in 2000, Devdas in 2002, Jodhaa Akbar in 2008 and most recently, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil late last year. Whatever her on-screen avatar, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's beauty look off the screen has always veered towards the classic, with her either emphasising her stunning eyes with a slick of liner and kohl, or making a statement with a bold red lip. However, that's not to say that the actor has not taken risks: do you remember that experimental purple lip at the Cannes 2016 red carpet? From her win at Miss World in 1994 to her latest Cannes appearance, check out Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's complete beauty evolution. 
The early days Throwback to 1994, the year she won her title, she was spotted in a basic mascara, brick red lipstick and blown-out hair. Then, for her first Cannes appearance in 2003, she wore monochrome make-up with brown eyeshadow and a lip gloss in the same colour with her hair slicked back and held together in a high bun. She let her hair down in tight curls in 2004 and 2005 saw her open up the curls and work metallic eyeshadow. While she moved back to straight hair in 2006, she took to metallic eyes again in 2007 and elaborate updos from 2008 through to 2010. 
In a new decade Come 2011 and Bachchan sported silky straight hair, pink lipgloss and loads of mascara. 2012 was the year of blown out curls, kohl-rimmed eyes and nude lips, a look she carried well into 2013. However, 2013 was also the year her signature winged eye came into play along with the occasional smoky shadow, a bold red lip and straightened hair in a middle part that she wears even today. 
2014 saw the actor embrace bold lips with a bright scarlet and a berry pout on the red carpet along with big Hollywood waves. She played it safe in 2015 with basic nude lips and eyeliner. While her hair oscillated between straight and curly, in 2016 she wore bright reds as many times as she did light pinks and peach on her lips. Coming back to present day, 2017 has been all about poker straight hair, a signature full pout and multiple coats of mascara. 
Have a look at the gallery above for a look at her complete beauty evolution.

The Vogue Beauty Awards 2017 jury gets Snapping

Have you ever seen Mira Rajput Kapoor in a Snapchat filter? 
You can love it or hate it, but you can't deny the selfie movement started by Snapchat and its filters. While taking selfies used to be restricted only to the days people were done up, these filters made it possible to get a good-looking picture on an everyday basis and a funny one, the norm. Basic accessories were upgraded to new backgrounds and even face swaps—who knows what's to come next. We asked our Vogue Beauty Awards 2017 jury for their favourite Snapchat filters and we definitely weren't disappointed. 
While the two most popular Snapchat filters, the ‘flower crown' and the ‘dog ears' have split the Snap-verse in two, when it comes to which is most-loved, our beauty experts seem to favour the flower crown. “I love the floral crown because it just makes everyone look stunning,” says Pernia Qureshi. Besides Qureshi, Pooja Hegde, Dr Malavika Kohli, Adhuna Bhabani and Dr Harshna Bijlani love it too. On the other hand, Karisma Kapoor and Mickey Contractor stand by the trusty dog ears for their selfies. Karishma Manga Bedi chose the glowing flowers over the crown and Diana Penty picked the summer hat as her favourite. Mira Rajput Kapoor decided to forsake the popular picks and proclaimed her love for the adorable deer filter. 
Flip through the gallery for a look at each of them wearing their most-loved Snapchat filters.

Don’t hold your breath 
Kate Middleton and Prince William's royal tour of Poland and Germany continues, and with it so many sartorial opportunities. As is custom, however, the royal couple have spent many hours discussing all things with members of the public. 
One particular well wisher, who presented the couple with a gift for their children Princess Charlotte and Prince George, prompted a reply by Kate which has sent the British tabloids into a frenzy. 
So what was the comment in question? 
“We will just have to have more babies!” the Duchess said, according to a Daily Mirror reporter, after thanking the woman for her gift. 
Yep, Kate joked about having more kids. 
Whether or not it was a hint at what's to come, the comment has certainly gotten us very excited for another potential royal baby, but if the cute-ness of George and Charlotte was anything to go by, we might not be able to handle it.

I miss my babies!!!! #roohiandyash 
A post shared by Karan Johar (@karanjohar) on Jul 17, 2017 at 9:58pm PDT 
It was on March 5 when Karan Johar introduced Yash and Roohi Johar to the world, confirming that he has now become the proud father of twins via surrogacy. Ever since their birth, Yash and Roohi have become a major topic of discussion amongst B-town celebrities and Karan Johar's fans. 
While Johar has been busy travelling for IIFA 2017 where he was the host, this morning he took to Instagram to share a glimpse of his little ones—an adorable picture of his twins' tiny hands, one of them clutching the fingers of an adult hand, which could be his. What makes it even more special is the caption of the picture that says: “I miss my babies!!!! #roohiandyash”, proving that he's just like any other parent on a work trip.

Congratulations, Mindy! 
Everyone's favourite funny woman, Mindy Kaling, is expecting her first child. 
According to E! News, the new came as “an unexpected surprise” but confirmed that Kaling is thrilled. 
In 2015, Kaling predicted the pregnancy (and it's “unexpected” timing) saying in an interview she was looking forward to letting it happen naturally. 
“I think I've decided that unlike everything else in my life, I'm going to be fast and loose about kids,” she told Yahoo Style. “I'm going to not actively plan, but if it happens, it would happen.” 
Kaling is set to appear in the upcoming film, A Wrinkle In Time, and as the final season of The Mindy Project wraps up later this year, it seems just about perfect timing to welcome a child. 
Congratulations, Mindy!

See who’s taken over 
As of July 11, 2017, Wiz Khalifa's ‘See You Again' featuring Charlie Puth has hit more than 2 billion views on YouTube, beating Korean artist Psy's 'Gangnam Style' in the most watched video category. 
Released in 2015, ‘See You Again' by Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth was featured in the action movie Furious 7 and was created as a tribute to the late Paul Walker, whose untimely death was a shock to the industry and fans. He was killed in a car crash prior to the completion of the film and as a consequence, the ending of the film panned out differently than originally planned. 
Psy's ‘Gangnam Style' maintained the record of the most viewed video for five years from 2012, prior to which it was Justin Bieber's ‘Baby' that held the spot.

Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif’s banter is what true friendship is made of 
After three years of being in the pipeline, Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif's romantic comedy, Jagga Jasoos, is finally ready to hit theatres this weekend. The Disney movie, directed by Anurag Basu, chronicles the story of Jagga (played by Ranbir Kapoor) a gifted teenage detective, who along with his female companion, Shruti (played by Katrina Kaif) is on a quest to find his missing father. 
Ahead of the big release, the on-screen pair has been seen promoting their upcoming movie at various events. Whether it was on the sets of television shows or a visit to the radio station, Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif have been entertaining their fans with their hilarious antics. 
From rehearsing dialogues together at the studio and cute Boomerangs, to Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif dancing with students at their school, and getting their competitive streak on, the Kaif's Instagram feed is filled with interesting unseen moments between the duo. What we love most is a dance-off video, where Kaif and Kapoor are seen shaking a leg to a song from Jagga Jasoos.

This little guy’s closet is giving us wardrobe envy 
Ever since his birth, Saif Ali and Kareena Kapoor Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan has taken the internet by storm. Whether it is attending a birthday party with his mom or playing on a swing set on his terrace—the toddler creates quite the stir every time the paparazzi get a hold of a new picture. And just like his mom, the six-month-old is not afraid of all the attention and the shutterbugs. 
While his parents may have their hands full with their upcoming movies, with Saif Ali Khan working on his new feature Chef, and mom Kareena Kapoor Khan shooting for Veere Di Wedding, Taimur spent some time with his grandmother recently. The baby Nawab was seen with his nanny visiting his paternal grandmother, famed actor Sharmila Tagore, at her Mumbai residence. 
All rosy cheeks and wide-open eyes, Taimur was spotted in what looks like head-to-toe Ralph Lauren: polo T-shirt, stripped pants and tiny white shoes with Ralph Lauren emblazoned on the soles—a look that wouldn't be out of place for an afternoon of horse riding. 
What's more, the little bundle of joy was also recently seen wearing a kurta and looked just like his father who loves sporting the Indian staple from time to time.

Stop everything you're doing and look at this 
Taimur Ali Khan, pint-sized replica of Kareena Kapoor Khan and all-round cutie, has made the internet's day yet again. This time, the cherubic six-month-old was spotted enjoying himself on a swing set on his terrace. 
If you look closely, you can see him looking directly at the paparazzi, confirming what we've said previously: this kid is made to be in front of the camera. 
With Kareena Kapoor Khan not on any social media platform, Taimur's rare outings become as much of a viral sensation as his mother's updates, and it's not a surprise, given how absolutely adorable he is (have you seen those delicious cheeks?). 
In case you missed it, check out some more of his chubby goodness here and here.

Finally 
Ever since George and Amal Clooney welcomed twins in June (it really was the month of twins), we've wanted to see a picture. 
Well, now thanks to photos obtained by TMZ, we have the first images of the new family. 
Although you can't exactly see the twins, the photos show the family leaving a private plane in Milan. 
Each twin is pictured with their very own paparazzi-proof white lace bassinet—very cute. Is it weird we want to see more of the Clooney's baby accessories? 
Now all we need is a photo of Beyoncé and Jay Z's twins and we can get on with our lives.

If there's one pair we are always rooting for it has got to be Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone. While the duo hasn't been seen much together lately, the power pair headed out together to ring in Singh's 31st birthday last evening. 
And it looks like there was more than one reason to celebrate, as Singh was seen driving around his brand-new Aston Martin as he picked up Padukone before they headed for a romantic meal to The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Colaba to kick off the celebrations for his big day. 
From the time that they left together hand in hand at the Ambani's party to the day a love-struck Singh chased Padukone with a yellow flower at Farah Khan's 50th birthday bash, here's looking back at some more of the cutest moments of the duo.

A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Jul 1, 2017 at 5:06am PDT 
Ever since his birth back in May this year, Zack Lalvani has been a major topic of discussion amongst Lisa Haydon's fans. Though the new mom hasn't shared any clear photographs of her first child yet, she has taken to Instagram a handful of times over the past few months to share a few glimpses of her son with her followers. 
After posting that adorable snapshot of her toddler's pout (and his very dapper looking onesie), it was this cosy picture of Haydon cuddling Zack to sleep that took over the internet last month. And just yesterday, Haydon shared yet another picture of little Zack, flaunting his tiny Bonpoint socks while napping on his monkey-print sheets. Playfully captioned with the peach emoji, the post has already got more than 65,000 likes. Want more updates on Bollywood's sweetest babies?

And more details you never knew 
It's been two months since Karan Johar brought home his twins Yash and Roohi, but the babies are still a topic of major interest amongst the director's fans all over the globe. 
Recently, the new dad spoke to Hindustan Times about his experiences so far, and the interview led to some very insightful confessions. Here are some of Johar's most unforgettable quotes. 
On making the decision “I had been thinking about having a child for a long time. And I knew I had the capacity to be an adequate parent. I've nurtured so many people in the film industry, so many young actors, I've been like a parent to them more than a producer and director. I've been with them in their professional highs and their emotional meltdowns. But I played devil's advocate with myself. Was I being selfish? Did I want to have a child only because I was afraid of growing old alone? Would I be an overprotective and overindulgent father because I wouldn't want my child to accuse me of being a flawed parent and grow up missing a mother? But who's to tell me that I can't be a responsible parent, and the best mother and father in the world to my kid? This was an emotional, well-thought-out decision made after acknowledging and addressing all the issues facing me, and after considering all the responsibilities and duties that come with being a single parent. I was ready for fatherhood. But was I prepared for twins? I was ready for triplets!” 
On his “biggest blockbuster” “My life has changed since Roohi and Yash arrived. At 44, this is my biggest blockbuster. I still haven't realised the enormity of what's happened. They're only two months old. And all they do is eat, sleep, burp, wail and poop. Kabhi khushi, kabhie gham! While I stare at them in wonder. But I can't get over the fact that they are mine. It's like a powerful switch has suddenly come on in my life, filling the emptiness in my personal space with new energy. I get teary-eyed just looking at them. It's surreal to think of them as my daughter and son.” 
On milestone moments “The day they came home from the hospital is an experience that's going to stay etched in my memory. Like the premier of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1998. It was my first film and I still remember every moment. What I wore. What I said. The day I carried Roohi and Yash home was like that. Life changing. Actually, it was a full on K3G moment! Very dramatic. With my Mom proudly standing at the door like Jaya Aunty holding a puja thali with burning diyas to welcome not her bahu – but her grandkids, all my aunts crowded behind her. I took my babies straight into the room where my father's picture is placed. When I saw their reflection in the glass, merging with his image, I closed my eyes in gratitude and experienced the awe of the moment. I knew they had his blessings. These are scenes out of a film but drawn from real life. For me, that was a moment of faith. But it was only the trailer. Picture abhi baki hai!” 
On the twins' new best friend “People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I've been running around serving them tea and snacks. Alia Bhatt comes every other day and sits for hours. I'm not paranoid about people wanting to hold my babies. Roohi and Yash are not royalty and meant to be stared at from behind a glass window. But I insist they sanitise their hands and take off their footwear first. Babies absorb energy.” 
On family ties “I introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name. ‘This is your Chacha and this is your Bua!' I give them all a family tag. I want my babies to know that their family is large. It's not just Mom and me, though my mother is my biggest support. She's had multiple surgeries for the spine, for her hips, knees, she's been in and out of hospital constantly. But you should see her now. Full of zing! She's up early, fully made up and with her hair done, ready to face a new day with her grandkids. I've never seen her looking younger than she is today.” 
On acing the dad role “I want all the help I can I get. I have an entire library of books on baby care. I haven't read any of them! But I listen to all the advice mothers give me. I'm on several WhatsApp baby groups. Everybody has their own gyan. And I've received about 3,000 suggestions already. On paediatricians, nurses, how to make the nursery adaptive, what music to play for them – Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven – dude, when did all this happen? – or simple nursery rhymes, which formula is best – Nan Pro, Similac or Enfamil, how to burp them, monitor their temperatures, when to take them for their immunity shots, what to do if they have nappy rash, what to do when they cry, I listen to everybody and then take my own decisions. I could give paranoid mothers a master class!” 
On parenting challenges "Fatherhood is proving to be a breathtaking rollercoaster ride. When they were conceived, I was ecstatic, but I told myself I would be a responsible father and not a paranoid mother. Then came the complexities of premature birth. And the heartache of seeing them in the incubator. But I felt a strong sense of ownership. They were my lifelines. A lifelong dream come true. And I couldn't wait to take them in my arms. When I did that for the first time, it was incredible. I knew this was the beginning of a different kind of love story. The start of the best phase of my life. Mothers go through these emotions. Fathers come in later. But I was there right from the start, with the other mothers in the ICU whose babies were also born weighing less than 1.5 kilos, their vital body parts, their tiny lungs and heart underdeveloped. And each time a baby crossed 2 kilos and the nurses put up a smiley sunshine face announcing this, I would celebrate with their mothers because I fully empathised with them."

"When I read the papers now, I keep thinking of you" 
My Dearest Nimki, 
I am sorry. I am sorry because I realise today that I can't always protect you. I know I tell you all the time that no matter what, Baba will always be there and all you have to do is call me and I will come and take care of you. And you believe me, because there is nothing better than believing in someone implicitly and unconditionally, knowing that there is always someone there who will always protect you. And for you, that's your Baba. But my dearest Nimki, when I read the papers today about what's happening in Bangalore and Delhi, I know that there are horrible men in the world who may mistreat you because of the way you dress, because of the way you speak, because you decide to have a glass of wine or eat meat, and worst of all, because of who you are, an independent, beautiful, proud, Indian woman. And as long as I am here, I will always protect you from those men, but I will not always be there, so what I will do from now on is to prepare you, prepare you to be strong, in mind and in body, prepare you to love, and never to stop loving, prepare you to use your mind because no matter what, no one can take that away from you, and prepare you, as much as I and your Mama can, to withstand all the world will throw at you because you are a woman. 
My dearest Nimki, my life has been groomed by women, and to me, I am the Baba that I am to you because of everything I have learned from your Mimi and your Mama and all the other woman who have touched my life. I am defined by my Mama (your Mimi), the man that I have become by your Mama, and the man I will always be because of you. So no illiterate, ignorant, idiotic man will ever tell you what to do, will ever disrespect you, will ever hurt you. You will be smart, you will be strong, and you will lead, and everyone will know that. And although your Mama will tell you that I am being slightly harsh, I know I am not when I get tough with you. I am a man, and I know the hurt that we can cause, and you my Nimki, will never feel that hurt. 
So when I read the papers now, I keep thinking of you. I keep thinking what if that's you, what if that's my daughter. And while the fear paralyses me, I quickly collect myself, and I ask God to help me, that I raise you to absorb all the pain that the world will throw at you, the pain that men might inflict on you, and you will persevere, and you will be OK. And if I am not there (and I won't be there always) I promise you, just like I have promised you that I will always be there—I promise you that I will make you strong and I will help you to love, always. 
My dearest Nimki, the world might be very cruel sometimes, but I know that you will never be.

💘💘💘all my heart 
A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on May 29, 2017 at 4:38am PDT 
On May 17, Lisa Haydon and husband Dino Lalvani welcomed their first child, Zack Lalvani, into the world. 
The couple announced the big news just days later on Haydon's Instagram page, and had fans not just celebrating their big moment with them, but waiting intently for a first look at their son. 
The new mom finally shared a first peek of her little boy with her followers last week, posting a cropped shot of Zack decked out in a romper that resembled a crisp white shirt and checkered bowtie. From the little bit that we can see of his face, this kid's pout is a mini version of his mom's, just as was the case for Kareena Kapoor Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. Check out Haydon's sweetest pregnancy moments (and the wedding pictures you never saw) here.

A match to remember 
  
Yessssss! C'mon India!!! 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 #jaihind 
A post shared by Abhishek Bachchan (@bachchan) on Jun 4, 2017 at 11:01am PDT 
This weekend was an eventful one for cricket fans, who spent their Sunday watching India play against Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy. 
Amongst the many cheering their team on were star duo Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The couple shared a selfie on Bachchan's official Instagram page during the match, captioned “Yessssss! C'mon India!!! #jaihind”, which has earned more than 150,000 likes in less than 24 hours. If you're a fan of the couple, you may not have to wait too long to see them together on the silver screen again. Rumour has it they will star in Anurag Kashyap's next film. 
In case you missed it, India won the match last evening by 124 runs in Birmingham, England, and had everyone from Bollywood stars Ranveer Singh and Varun Dhawan to cricket pros like Suresh Raina riveted. Check out what they had to say on India's victory.

You have to see this 
Ever since his birth, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi has been one of Bollywood's most-talked about babies. And though neither of his parents are officially on social media, the toddler has topped trending charts in India each time a picture of his has managed to leak out. 
For Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan's fans, last week was exceptionally exciting, as it marked little Taimur's very first public appearance. The six-month-old accompanied his mom to Tusshar Kapoor's son's first birthday party, and the pictures instantly went viral. 
Days after Taimur's big party moment, two new images of the toddler have hit the internet. The first, an inside shot from the birthday celebration shows Taimur looking straight into the camera while hanging out at the party, while the second, a more casual shot, features him smiling into the lens wearing a tee with sailor stripes. If you missed his cutest party pictures from last week, click here to see them all.

Happy birthday, Marilyn Monroe: Remembering the icon 
The peroxide perm, the wiggle, the adroitly placed beauty mark—Marilyn Monroe endures as one of the great female style icons of the 20th century, and she has never wandered far from popular imagination. 
So vivid is her youthful pouting image that it is hard to believe today, the first of June, would have been her 91st birthday. A shimmering concoction of contradictions, simultaneously Aphrodite and girl-next-door, Monroe's signature mix of vulnerability and voluptuousness has become the shorthand for timeless glamour. Our fascination for the woman and the legend shows no sign of abating. Last year, the sheer Jean Louis gown worn by Monroe to serenade John F Kennedy in 1962 sold for a world-record price at auction, fetching $4.8 million (Rs 31 crore). 
But her widespread presence risks diminishing Monroe's contribution to style. Like the Sydney Opera House or the Mona Lisa, her image is so familiar, so utterly ubiquitous, that it is sometimes hard to see the mastery that lurks beneath. 
In a career that spanned just 16 years, Monroe established herself as an actor, producer, singer, business woman, aspiring intellectual and, above all, a sex symbol. Far removed from the demure restraint of the prevailing 1950s Hollywood ideal, Monroe used clothes and makeup as a tool to perpetuate her sex goddess image. She reputedly sewed buttons into the bust points of her garments to create the impression of pert nipples, and described the lips half-open tilted pose seen in countless photographs as “the look”. 
In his autobiography, designer Bill Blass describes a fitting at the actor's apartment. “Monroe is the only woman I ever met who gave all her attention to her derriere,” he recalled. “She knew exactly what those seams should do.” 
The gold lamé dress with sunray pleats designed by William Travilla for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was judged too revealing by the censors, and was only seen briefly in the film. But Monroe insisted on wearing the dress accept an award at the 1953 Photoplay Awards at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
When it comes to Monroe's best-known style moments, it is the film stills that are seared onto the collective fashion imagination: the billowing white halterneck in The Seven Year Itch, the pink duchess satin bodice and matching gloves worn in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, and the sheer beaded gown in Some Like It Hot—still shockingly sheer, and so tight that her pregnant form reportedly had to be sewn in. 
Monroe provided a paradigm of on-screen sexuality, true, but it is her off-screen style that really impacted how women get dressed. There were the high-waisted jeans carefully darted to display her curves, the crisp white shirts, the polo necks, the pencil skirts, the hourglass black midi dresses, the belted camel coats and the cat-eye sunglasses. 
Although fashion classics by contemporary standards, in the 1950s much of what she wore was considered risqué. Joan Crawford berated her wardrobe for its “vulgarity”. But viewed now with the benefit of hindsight, Monroe's approach to fashion looks altogether different. Simply put, her style legacy is this: she harnessed the feminine and made it powerful. And that holds as much currency today as it did 60 years ago.

Life before becoming a global icon 
From Miss World to Quantico favourite and now, Baywatch villain, Priyanka Chopra has sealed her spot as one of Bollywood and Hollywood's most recognised faces. But what was the icon like before all the fame? 
If you're one of Chopra's 17.6 million followers, you know the star never shies away from posting even the most intimate moments from her day-to-day life. And one of the best parts about her page are the occasional childhood pictures she shares with her fans. 
From family holidays in Kashmir to that much-loved snapshot of the actor decked up as a little bride, Chopra's feed is loaded with wonderful memories (and one hilarious meme that spotlights her transformation over the years too). 
Perhaps the most bittersweet of all her throwback shots are the photographs featuring her late father, Dr Ashok Chopra, who she shared a very special bond with. It's no wonder the star has the phrase “Daddy's lil girl” tattooed on her right wrist. Want to know the full story behind that piece of body art? Watch this video to find out.

The name of the film is… 
Having been seen together on the silver screen in several blockbusters including Bodyguard, Yuvvraaj and Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?, Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan are undoubtedly one of Bollywood's favourite pairs. 
As the two shoot together yet again for Tiger Zinda Hai, the sequel to Ek Tha Tiger, news about the duo starring in one of Karan Johar's next films has also begun to do the rounds. 
“While KJo's next directorial will be with Ranbir Kapoor, he wants to produce a film with Salman and Katrina in the lead as he finds their chemistry sizzling,” a source told DNA. “Earlier, the same film was to star Fawad Khan along with Katrina, but ... that is not happening. Hence the filmmaker was keen to rope in Salman. The script is being reworked for Dabangg Khan and to make the character more suitable to him. The pre-production work on the film has begun,” the article quotes the source as saying. 
Can't wait to know more about the upcoming project? The report continued to mention the film may be a musical romance. Its tentative title: Raat Baaki.

Grab yours before it’s too late 
Stuart Vevers, creative director at Coach wants you to dream big, really big. The '70s might be trending on the runway, what with the return of flared jeans and florals, but Vevers is imagining a different era—that of the American space exploration. As an ode to the times where dreams of walking on the moon had just been materialised, Coach has launched a limited edition capsule collection called ‘Coach Space'. 
If you thought the brand's pre-fall 2017 collection had some interesting sweatshirts and outerwear, Coach Space has more of that. Talking about the line of handbags, Vevers commented saying, “The collection is very nostalgic. There's something about the time of the Space Program that just gives this feeling of possibility. The space references, rockets and planets are symbolic of a moment of ultimate American optimism and togetherness.” 
NASA-inspired logos, stars, rockets and the brand's mascot, Rexy the dino, all feature in the playful line-up. Using vintage flight bags as a reference, Coach introduces the Dylan with this collection. Here's a closer look at the line.

Brighten, hydrate and chill 
If you're ready to embrace a new streamlined summertime approach to beauty, these clever and colourful Korean sheet masks might just be the solution. Arriving this month from Peach Slices, the promising sister skincare line from the founder of cult K-beauty mainstay Peach & Lily, each cotton sheet comes packed with potent, time-tested Eastern botanicals like yuzu and lotus—and is clearly labeled for the most foolproof, targeted treatment. 
Designed by Alicia Yoon to cut through the traditional 10-step-plus Korean skin ritual, each mask is printed with easy-to-follow instructions and key ingredients. Calm's blend of chamomile and jasmine is perfect for soothing skin that has seen too much wind or sun. Firm harnesses the powers of pomegranate and honey, while Clarify uses detoxifying persimmon leaves and loquat. Also on the menu: Brighten, Shrink Pores, and Hydrate. 
Each slim packet, which fits into even the most tightly edited of travel kits, touts an age-old Korean proverb—courtesy of Yoon's grandmother—printed at the top in traditional characters. “Big things come in small packages, as the smallest pepper is the spiciest,” reads one of our favuorites. Sounds like solid life advice worth taking into the weekend.

Alia Bhatt gets the birthday boy to confess 
  
Over the years, getting Bollywood's biggest stars to answer the world's most burning questions about them has become one of Karan Johar's most popular talents. But as he turns 45 today, the director switched things up, letting Alia Bhatt interview him live on Facebook for the very first time. “If Roohi and Yash could talk, I'm sure they would be doing this interview,” Bhatt announced to Dharma Productions' social media followers. “So who comes next in line after Roohi and Yash? Me!” 
Over the next 50 minutes, the star got the birthday boy talking about everything from the three brands he will always endorse (“I hope to Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior don't feel bad,” he laughs after giving his answer) his favourite selfie angles, and the funniest interaction he's ever had with Indians overseas. 
Ending it all was a quick Koffee With Karan-style rapid fire where Johar confessed about the coolest thing in his office (“My chair with feathers on it”), his plans to introduce new stars to Bollywood in the near future (“Yes, three faces coming up this year very soon, and will be at a theatre near you next year”), his worst habit ever, and the one thing that always makes him smile, before receiving his first present and diving into a scrumptious birthday cake. Watch all the action now.

The sweetest posts you’ll see today 
As you may already know, Karan Johar turned 45 yesterday and celebrated his special moment with a huge party at home with his closest celebrity friends. 
What made the star's big day even more special was the fact that this was the first birthday he celebrated as a father (Johar's twins Roohi and Yash were born earlier this year), and of course, the many heartfelt wishes he received through the day on social media. 
While Karisma Kapoor, Amrita Arora Ladak, Abhishek Bachchan and Farah Khan Kunder celebrated their friend's birthday with rarely-seen throwback shots, Riteish Deshmukh put up a piece of fan art for Johar on his Instagram page, and both Raveena Tandon and Sidharth Malhotra decided to wish the much-loved director with their favourite party pictures from last night.

Everything you need to know about his India trip 
While no pictures have been released to confirm the news, rumour has it that Hollywood actor Brad Pitt is currently in Mumbai to promote his upcoming film War Machine. 
The star, who landed early Wednesday morning, is staying at the Trident Hotel. He is said to have made plans while in the city to meet Shah Rukh Khan later in the day to discuss cinema over the years, and might also stop by for the special screening of the movie at PVR High Street Phoenix. 
War Machine, a satirical comedy, will see Pitt take on the lead role of General McMahon. The movie is based on journalist Michael Hastings's non-fiction book, The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan, and has been produced by Pitt's company Plan B, which has in the past produced movies including 12 Years A Slave. 
This trip is Pitt's second one to India. The actor last visited the country with his children while ex-wife Angelina Jolie was shooting for A Mighty Heart.

All smiles since 1985 
No matter where she goes, Jacqueline Fernandez takes her happy-go-lucky attitude with her. And it turns out that the star's trademark bubbly personality has been a constant throughout her life. 
If you follow Fernandez on Instagram, you've probably already seen most of her super-entertaining videos and hilarious selfies. But you may have missed the actor's rare throwback photographs, featuring the star testing out her horse-riding skills as a toddler, imitating monkeys with her siblings in Sri Lanka and twinning in red-ribboned pig tails with her sister. 
What makes each of Fernandez's childhood pictures so special is that she usually saves them for important occasions, marking each big day in her parents' lives with a special memory. Don't miss the picture-perfect snapshot she used to wish her father on Valentine's Day, the old birthday photo she picked for Mother's Day, and the group shot featuring all her siblings used to make Father's Day twice as special. In Fernandez's own words, “I'll always be his #monkeyprincess”.

Over the last few days, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has been unmissable online. The star attended the 70th Cannes Film Festival this week with her daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, taking over the internet with her most extravagant red carpet ensembles, and keeping busy with the international showcase of her 2002 film Devdas. 
In the midst of all the activity, Rai Bachchan also managed to make time for some interviews. And when asked about whether she'll be seen in a Bollywood film anytime soon, the star confirmed that she and her husband Abhishek Bachchan have, in fact, been approached to star in Anurag Kashyap's upcoming project. 
“We have been approached for Gulab Jamun,” the star revealed during a FaceTime interview from Cannes, according to ABP Live, “and they have narrated us the script. Personally, I had taken time out for the past five months now. I had taken time out for my mother and my family,” said Bachchan, who lost her father Krishnaraj Rai to lymphoma this March. “I just started listening to scripts from last week and have already liked two subjects. If and when we feel the time is right, we will share that with you.” Rumours of Rai Bachchan hosting a new season of Kaun Banega Crorepati in place of her father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan have also been doing the rounds, but the star has made no comment to confirm the news yet. 
As for the couple, Abhishek and Aishwarya have worked together in several films in the past including Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke, Umrao Jaan, Dhoom 2, Guru and Raavan, and continue to be one of the Indian film industry's most-loved duos.

Heart broken 
Nineteen people are confirmed dead and 50 have been injured following an explosion at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. 
The explosion took place just after 10.30pm local time, in the Manchester Arena, during Grande's performance. 
The Greater Manchester Police Force released a statement confirming 19 people were dead, “with around 50 others injured.” 
According to a police statement released on Twitter, the explosion is currently being treated as a “terrorist incident” until “police know otherwise.” 
Local police have deployed a bomb unit to the area, clearing both the Arena and the nearby Manchester train station, and have urged people to stay away from the area. 
While Reuters are reporting a suspected suicide bomber, British police have yet to confirm this. 
The Manchester Arena has a capacity of 21,000 people and as per Grande's fan base, many were children accompanied to the concert by their parents. 
A representative for Ariana Grande spoke to Variety, to confirm she is “okay” and is “further investigating what happened.” Grande is currently performing in Manchester as part of her Dangerous Woman Tour. 
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was not known if any Australians were involved. 
Meanwhile, Facebook has activated its Safety Check for people in the area to check in as safe. 
Ariana Grande has spoken out about the incident, tweeting: "broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words."

Here’s everything we know so far 
For a while now, the world has been wondering when and with whom will they get to see Saif Ali Khan's daughter Sara Ali Khan on the silver screen. From rumours about the Bollywood ingénue starring in Student Of The Year 2 to musings about her entering the industry under Salman Khan's wing, news has come and gone with no confirmation. 
The latest bit of talk regarding Ali Khan to hit the internet now hints at the 23-year-old making her debut opposite Sushant Singh Rajput in director Abhishek Kapoor's next project. According to a report published by DNA, the movie will be produced by Balaji Motion Pictures. “Sushant was to do Abhishek's film but his dates weren't available,” the newspaper quoted. “Now, they are coming together with a love story. The film is scheduled to go on floors sometime next year." The report also included the following quote from a source at the production house: “[Kapoor] wanted a fresh pairing for his film. He decided to cast Saif's daughter as the female lead in the film. The team has met Sara and she has liked it. She is most likely to sign on within two weeks." 
Given that Khan's mother Amrita Singh is friends with Ekta Kapoor, the pairing couldn't be more perfect. "Ekta is very close to Sara's mom Amrita Singh,” the source stated. “In fact, Ekta revived her career on the small screen when she wanted to return to acting. Amrita was also seen in Ekta's production, A Flying Jatt, as Tiger Shroff's mom. Amrita trusts her to launch her daughter, and has given her blessings to this project."

Aaradhya and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan touch down at Cannes! 
There's no way you haven't noticed Deepika Padukonemaking waves with one envy-worthy ensemble after another at the 70th edition of Cannes Film Festival. And if you're an Aishwarya Rai Bachchan fan, you don't have to wait too long now to see the icon light up the French Riviera too. 
Bachchan departed Mumbai last night with daughter Aaradhya in tow, and the first images of her after landing in France have already cropped up online. Dressed in a camel-coloured Burberry trench coat and jeans, the icon was welcomed with a bouquet of roses that matched perfectly with her daughter's headband (and her adorable pink Gucci sling). 
Having attended the festival almost every year since 2002, Bachchan is no stranger to Cannes. The star also visited the town during her honeymoon, and her 2017 trip is doubly special as she will be spotlighting Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas, the movie she first presented at the event.

What are Aaradhya and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan up to on holiday? 
Travelling to Cannes with daughter Aaradhya has become a tradition of sorts for Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. “She has my kind of built-in energy, she loves the experience, the colours, the people and the place,” the star told us during the annual film festival last year. “And now that she's been here before, she remembers it all when she comes back. So each year when it's time to come back, she recollects her Cannes moments and knows that it's going to be that time of the year, our time together!” 
Since the duo touched down in Cannes yesterday, Bollywood fans have been waiting excitedly for another peek at their holiday activities. In case you missed it, the Bachchan ladies were welcomed to their hotel last evening with bouquets of roses and strawberries dipped in chocolate. And to make their vacation more memorable, Bachchan senior stepped out today to explore Cannes with her daughter before she gets busy with her red carpet duties. 
Just as the pictures of them leaving their hotel for the day (Aaradhya in a summer daisy-print dress, Aishwarya in a crisp white Versace blazer) hit the internet, Bachchan's stylist Aastha Sharma shared an image of the star's very first Cannes 2017 ensemble, a green Yanina maxi embroidered with red, pink and blue flowers. Catch up on all the action via our slideshow.

Beautiful since day one 
Though Kareena Kapoor Khan doesn't have an official Instagram account, the star is ever present on social media thanks to her many fan pages and of course, her Instagram-savvy sister Karisma Kapoor. 
While the world continues to gush over all the new images of Kareena's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi online, we decided to look back at the Kapoor sisters' childhood pictures. Over the years, Karisma has shared a handful of adorable memories you may have missed. 
Always accompanied with loving hashtags like #SisterLove, #ToTheBestSisterEver and #SisterPower, Karisma's pictures span through all of the duo's phases while growing up. One of the earliest childhood moments shared on her page—a black-and-white post of herself spending quality time with grandfather Raj Kapoor—comes from before Kareena was born. After that come photographs of Karisma cuddling baby Kareena and travelling through Kashmir with her (dressed perfectly in the state's trademark attire, no less!), followed by a picture-perfect family portrait of the sisters (Karisma makes one stunning teen) with parents Randhir and Babita Kapoor, and amongst the most recent, a snap from 1997, when Karisma picked up her first Filmfare award with a 17-year-old Kareena supporting her all the way. After all, what are sisters for?

No one dances quite like Madhuri Dixit Nene. From 'Ek Do Teen' to 'Maar Dala', here's a look back at some of the actor's most beautiful dance performances of all time 
It's been 33 years since Madhuri Dixit-Nene took her first steps into the world of Bollywood with her debut film Abodh, and today the star is still known as one of the Indian film industry's most iconic faces. 
Having trained in kathak since the age of three, Dixit-Nene always made her movies more magical not just by her flawless acting skills, but also because of the effortlessly graceful moves she brought to each of her musical tracks. 
It was with the song ‘Ek Do Teen' in Tezaab, 1988, that the actor first got people tapping their feet along with her. Dressed in a pink one-shoulder crop top, yellow headband and rainbow skirt, the star's bubbly avatar made it to posters all over the country, and the rest was history. 
Some of her most unforgettable dance moments included that playful performance to ‘Didi Tera Devar Deewana' in Hum Aapke Hai Koun..! (admit it: you tried to re-create that purple sari too), the ever-sultry ‘Humko Aaj Kal Hai' from Sailaab, the star's too-dreamy-to-be-true moves in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas, and most recently, the time she gave Ranbir Kapoor a run for his money on the dance floor in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani's ‘Ghagra'. Here, we list 16 of Dixit-Nene's best silver screen dances.

Priyanka Chopra takes you to Baywatch’s world premiere 
Priyanka Chopra has had a very busy couple of days. Having just returned from South Africa, the actor geared up for her upcoming Hollywood film, Baywatch, with its world premiere on Saturday, May 13, in Miami. 
In true PC fashion, the star shared all the special moments from her day with her 17 million Instagram fans. Want in on the action? Don't miss her her selfie-style video featuring the larger-than-life Miami crowd that came to celebrate the movie, her star-studded red carpet moment and a sneak peek at one of her favourite fan posters from the event. 
Channelling Victoria Leeds, her sultry character in the movie, Chopra stepped out on the big day wearing a slinky vintage Halston dress in midnight blue, and added some major sparkles with Nirav Modi jewels. But if you think this premiere was the only big event in her weekend, you couldn't be more wrong. Scroll through our slideshow and to see more pictures of the star hanging with Dwayne Johnson during promotions, enjoying some time off by the beach with Victoria's Secret model Adriana Lima, and trying her hand at cooking with co-star Zac Efron on the sets of Despierta America, a Spanish language morning show airing in America.

Rounding up the most adorable messages 
Breakfasts in bed and fresh flowers are sweet, but these days, no celebration really counts until you share a picture dedicated to it on social media. 
For Mother's Day this May 14, Bollywood went all out posting adorable photographs to thank their moms for everything that they do for them. 
Throwbacks were a favourite this time. While Alia Bhatt put up a snap of herself as a toddler with her mom captioned, “I got it from my mama”, Instagram's newest member Katrina Kaif marked the occasion with a never-seen-before image of her favourite memory with mother Suzanne Turquotte. Deepika Padukone too gave the world a rare glimpse of her childhood, as did Athiya Shetty, Shraddha Kapoor, Jacqueline Fernandez, Kriti Sanon and Sussanne Khan. 
Amongst the parents, Sridevi couldn't help but share a picture of her daughters posing with the poster of her upcoming movie, while Twinkle Khanna had her followers in splits (as always) with an image of daughter Nitara's Mother's Day homework. Raveena Tandon proudly showed off her ‘Best Mom' certificate, and Shahid Kapoor gave wife Mira a shout-out, with the caption, “Misha is lucky to have you.” 
The most touching of posts, however, came from cousins Rhea and Arjun Kapoor, who remembered family members they've lost. While Rhea thanked her late grandmother for all she's taught her, Arjun, whose mother passed away in 2012, asked all his fans to give their moms a hug from him too.

This will have you LOL-ing so hard 
You've had a look at his justified rider, seen his face everywhere around the city—from posters in cafes to highway billboards—and heard enough about Justin Bieber's India leg of his Purpose World Tour to last till his next visit. But we're not done yet. At the concert last evening (which we obviously attended), we sang along and screamed with the crowd and in the middle of it all, eavesdropped (involuntarily) on the concert-goers' conversations on everything Bieber-related and beyond. Here are the funniest snippets: 
When your best friend ditches you for more important pursuits Girl on the phone: “Listen, please come fast. Disha is hooking up with someone and I'm all alone.” 
When you didn't expect to see your distant cousin at the concert “Please don't tell your father that I smoke.” 
When you're a true Belieber Over-excited teenager: “I've come straight from the airport and have a flight back to Delhi at 2am tonight. I have an exam at school tomorrow.” Mother shaking her head in disbelief 
When the event hasn't managed to secure an alcohol licence and you want to make the most of the situation “What if I scream, ‘Guys, there's alcohol!'? Do you think we'll be able to move to the front?” 
When you're sober and the humidity hits you “I'm not drunk enough to enjoy this stickiness.” 
When it's 8.05pm and Biebs was supposed to show up at 8pm “He's probably chilling at the back in his Jacuzzi.” 
When young boys decide this is their only chance at finding true love Teenage boy to visibly-older girl: “Can you see him?” Girl: “Not really, can you?” Boy: “Do you want to come on top?” Girl: Confused and weirded out Boy: Points to his shoulders Girl: Walks away 
When you have issues with bodily sounds “I can hear him chewing his damned watermelon gum all the way here.” 
When Biebs asks you to look at the full moon and admire its beauty “How high is he?” 
And finally, when he walks off the stage and it all goes dark “Of course he'll come back and sing ‘Sorry', don't you remember Coldplay?”

Vogue Loves: Burberry’s latest DK88 bag series 
Burberry's spanking new bag collection is inspired by the luxury house's signature trench coat. First seen on the brand's spring 2017 runway show in February, the bags are made from an all-new Trench Leather material that closely mimics the twill finish of cotton gabardine. The DK88 bags come as a tribute to Thomas Burberry's iconic innovation of the honey-hued gabardine fabric. So why ‘DK88'? The alpha numerals are in-house code for the age-old gabardine. 
Blush pink, pistachio, marsala, olive green, and colour-blocked mauve and yolk-yellow, the bags deviate from the signature yellowish-beige of the trench coats with their colourful variants. Fixed with an oversized brass lock, the collection is for men and women and ranges across Burberry's top-handle, crossbody, satchel, bowling, barrel and luggage-inspired styles. 
Swipe through to see the making of the DK88 bag.

Hint: He’s got light eyes and white hair 
Alia Bhatt has always been an animal lover. The star and her sister Shaheen already have two cats, Sheeba and Pikka, and on Bhatt's 24th birthday, their family grew by one more when she gifted herself a third kitten, Edward Bhatt. 
Since the big day two months ago, both Bhatt sisters have been loading up their Instagram pages with one adorable snapshot of their new friend after another. But their posts couldn't be more different. 
If you follow Alia online, you've already seen her Edward album featuring the duo's most special, quiet times together. Cases in point: All those sleepy selfies (Snapchat filters included!), a photograph of Edward hiding in the bookshelf captioned “My son”, and a particularly sweet snapshot of little Edward keeping a sick Bhatt company while she ate pumpkin soup. 
In contrast, Shaheen's posts are perfect if you love quirky captions. One of our favourites has got to be a seemingly innocent picture of Edward curled up in bed where she says, “Today, Eddie ate, played, slept, ate, slept, played and ate in exactly that order. Still, for some reason, he looks like he's worried about how he's going to put three kids through college on his meagre salary”. Check out a few of the fluffy updates in our slideshow.

Alia Bhatt, Bipasha Basu and more at Justin Bieber’s Mumbai concert 
All anyone could talk about on May 10 this year was Canadian singing sensation Justin Bieber's arrival in Mumbai and his first musical performance at DY Patil Stadium. 
If you were one of the (very, very) few people who skipped this leg of the 23-year-old's Purpose Tour, you also missed out on the many stars who joined India's top Beliebers in the audience. There to sing along with the musician were Alia Bhatt (who came by with sister Shaheen), Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Jacqueline Fernandez, Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover, Huma Qureshi, Sophie Choudry, Kanika Kapoor, Bhumi Pednekar, Ayan Mukerji, Pooja Hegde, Amyra Dastur, Ananya Birla and Raveena Tandon. 
As a large part of Bieber's fan following includes teens and tweens, the stadium also filled up with celebrity parents chaperoning their enthusiastic kids. We spotted Sridevi and Boney Kapoor with daughter Khushi, Malaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan with their son Arhaan, Arjun Rampal with daughters Myra and Mahikaa Rampal, and Sonali Bendre Behl with son Ranveer.

Watch Justin Bieber’s first moments in Mumbai 
A post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on May 9, 2017 at 3:26pm PDT 
While Justin Bieber's band arrived in India days ago to prep for his performance at DY Patil Stadium tonight, the iconic Canadian musician touched down in Mumbai only early this morning. But a hush-hush arrival in the middle of the night wasn't enough to keep the shutterbugs and his most passionate followers away. 
Bieber, who was travelling in a chartered plane with a few members of his team, walked out of Mumbai's private terminal to screaming fans and flashing cameras at 1.30am on May 10 with none other than Salman Khan's bodyguard Shera at his side for support. Shera will be heading the security team that is taking care of Bieber in India during his stay. 
Dressed in a millennial pink Esprit x Opening Ceremony hoodie (we told you this colour would rule the season), the 23-year-old star was also spotted strolling through the airport's VIP lounge with a welcome bouquet of purple orchids in hand. He then proceeded to his hotel in Lower Parel in a white Mercedes Benz SUV. 
Can't wait to catch him singing your favourite tunes tonight? (Spoiler alert: He's going to arrive at the concert venue in a chopper.) Scroll through to check out his first moments in Mumbai and click here to take Vogue's Belieber quiz.

Here's how he announced the news 
Mumbai's Bieber fever may be at its peak right now (the 23-year-old performs at DY Patil Stadium tonight) but there's another international musician climbing up today's trending list in India. 
After tweeting (and later taking down) the news of a possible concert in Mumbai this June, Ed Sheeran has now confirmed that he will be returning to the city on November 19 for a performance. 
The English singer and songwriter's official website just released an updated list of spots he will be travelling to for his upcoming tour, saying “Ed has added 9 more cities to his tour of Asia” including Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Bangkok and Dubai. Mumbai is the only city in India Sheeran will be visiting this time." 
Since his last visit to India in 2015, Sheeran's list of chart-toppers including 'Thinking Out Loud' and 'I See Fire' has grown to include tracks like 'Castle On The Hill', 'Galway Girl', 'How Would You Feel' and global favourite 'Shape Of You'. Looks like this concert is going to be even better than his last. 
Sheeran's social media followers may have to wait a couple of days for him to confirm the news himself, however, as he seems to have left the building for a quick summer getaway.

Keep up with Bollywood’s future star 
From rumours of a debut under director Karan Johar in Student Of The Year 2 to talks about a possible Bollywood entry opposite Salman Khan's brother-in-law Aayush Sharma, Sara Ali Khan has been in the news for some time now. And though she frequently steps out for the shutterbugs (remember her party pictures from Kareena Kapoor Khan's 36th birthday celebrations?), Saif Ali Khan's daughter has remained tight-lipped about her blossoming Bollywood career. 
While the world waits for more news, Khan has topped trending charts this week yet again. Sabyasachi Mukherjee just shared some stunning shots of the star-to-be dressed in two of his regal lehengas. While the first features intricate gold work on navy blue, the second goes down a more girly route, bringing together a floral blouse and teal skirt. 
Want more insight on Khan? Head to her official Instagram page to check out pictures from her graduation ceremony and old vacations. Just nine posts old, the account already has close to 20,000 followers, and is the ideal place for fans and supporters to get to know her even before she takes over our silver screens.

The toddler's latest photograph has hit the internet 
[#image: /photos/5ce44624b803111d338f8f5d]||| ||| Image: Instagram.com 
Despite the fact that they do not hold official social media accounts (or more likely, because of it), Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan are one couple that are never short on public attention. The couple's wedding back in 2012, too, was a no-paparazzi celebration, underlining how the pair prefers to keep their private life, private. It is no surprise then, that their fans are always on the hunt for that one extra glimpse, that latest sneak peek that lets them into the world of "Saifeena". 
Bollywood fans are as fascinated with star kids as they are with the parents, and when the Khans welcomed their first child, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, on December 20, the internet's obsession with them only grew. Cases in point: the baby's very first family photograph, taken at Breach Candy Hospital made it to news channels all over the country, his portrait shot, (said to have been first posted as father Saif's WhatsApp picture) hit the internet within minutes, and then just a few weeks ago, it was his adorable cuddle moment with mom Kareena that had everyone's attention. 
The latest Taimur-related news doing the rounds: a snapshot of him ready to head out, all buckled up in his pram. While the origin of this photograph (which was released last evening) is hazy, it has already been picked up and circulated on Instagram by Bollywood news accounts, the couple's many fan pages, and fashion blogs too. While some can't get over his sharp ensemble—a smart pair of ebony jeans with a black, white and red polo, topped off with a sporty cap—others are sharing the picture to talk about how perfectly Taimur blends his parents' best features. This one, as usual, is going to take over your social media feeds for a while. 
Updated on May 29: Here's the latest picture of the toddler to hit the internet.

The star is in South Africa for a worthy cause 
Just hours after attending the Met Gala, Priyanka Chopra hopped onto a flight this week and headed to South Africa to meet its kids and raise awareness about child abuse. 
Though the star has only been travelling for a few days, her Instagram feed is filling up fast with heart-warming photographs and videos. From distributing bindis to little girls (“So much concentration!” she says. “Ended up on noses too… not just foreheads”) to giving Zimbabwe's locals a lesson on eating sugarcane and teaching them her favourite Bollywood-style dance moves, Chopra's had her hands full. The star also shared an adorable video of her new friends checking out her super sleek hair while she tells them how much she loves their natural curls. 
But that's not all. Scroll through our slideshow and you'll notice Chopra is also using her page to share the stories behind some of Harare's most heart-breaking issues. The star has posted pictures of the country's child line counsellors (who are available to kids facing physical and sexual abuse 24/7), one of Zimbabwe's Isibindi (meaning “courage” in Zulu) Safe Parks that focus on protecting children from the HIV/AIDS crisis, and families that battle poverty and illness on a daily basis. As Chopra puts it in one of her picture captions, “We cannot keep ignoring what is happening to our children around the world. My experience in Zimbabwe is a huge example of how the world is so desensitised to the plight of women and children. Mindsets need to change. It is not her fault!! She is not a commodity. Protect our children… they are the future.”

Everything you missed 
Katrina Kaif may be an Instagram newbie, but the star has wasted no time filling her official page up with never-seen-before snapshots that take you straight into her world. One of her most popular posts this week: a rare picture of herself captioned “Just found this, the 12 year old me was quite the poser”. 
Turns out Kaif wasn't the only one sharing throwbacks recently. Sushmita Sen remembered late photographer Prabuddha Dasgupta with a portrait he shot of her a month before she was crowned Miss India, Pooja Hegde took us back to her childhood with a photograph of herself as a toddler, and Abhishek Bachchan's #FlashbackFriday featured Hrithik Roshan and Aamir Khan. 
What else had the world double tapping on social media this week? Don't miss Saif Ali Khan's daughter Sara Ali Khan all dressed up in Sabyasachi for a wedding, Shilpa Shetty Kundra's flawless selfie with Goldie Hawn, Virat Kohli's post about Harbhajan Singh and Geeta Basra's daughter Hinaya Heer Plaha, and Sussanne Khan's Sunday spent with family.

From embellished music instruments to peacock feather sneakers 
The country's millennials aren't the only ones gearing up for Justin Bieber's arrival. With only two days until the Canadian pop sensation takes over Mumbai, here's what the fashion set has planned for him. 
1 
Varun Bahl has personally curated and embellished Indian musical instruments. “The sitar and tabla reflect the core of traditional music, embracing the dynamic culture we hail from. Adorned in the label's signature floral motifs and intricate embroidery, the instruments when presented to Justin Bieber, one of the biggest music icons of today's world, will symbolise the inter culture amalgamation of our cosmos,” explains Bahl 
2 
For Rohit Bal, a black biker jacket, handcrafted and embroidered with sequins and crystals from Swarovski is on the agenda. “The jacket is an amalgamation of Justin's personal style, Indian music and my version of a cross cultural fashion statement,” says Bal. 
3 
Amit Aggarwal, who has come to be known for his futuristic take on upcycling, is creating a khadi jacket with sleeves made using malleable recycled polymer sheet. 
4 
Departing from her signature, quirky aesthetic, Krishna Mehta has designed a bold shirt with geometric lines and metallic threads. “We have taken a step back from our typically bright colour palette in this particular piece. We wanted to achieve a fierce look, much like the super star himself, and his work,” says Mehta 
5 
While couturier Manav Gangwani is all-set to add an Indian twist to Bieber's much-talked about shoe collection with snake charmer- and peacock feather-adorned sneakers, Dhruv Kapoor is designing an oversized hoodie and Ragini Ahuja a distressed denim bomber jacket. 
6 
Designers also have big plans for the 23-year-old singer's mother, Patricia Mallett, who will be accompanying her son on his first tour of the country. Anamika Khanna has created a long floor length jacket featuring embroidery inspired by tribal India, and Riddhima Kapoor Sahni will be gifting her a bespoke wreath-shaped necklace replete with ornate rubies and marquise diamonds.

Everything you need to know 
Following all the talk about our cover, we felt that a few clarifications were in order. 
1 
We have lined-up a series of special issues for this entire year to celebrate our 10th anniversary, starting with the May 2017 Collector's Edition, which is not the anniversary issue. The actual 10th anniversary is October 2017. 
2 
In the last 10 years, Vogue India has had only 12 international covers, including Kendall Jenner, in 2017. Therefore, statistically, 90 per cent of our covers are Indian! And we are proud of that. 
3 
India has given the world so many beautiful faces to admire. After all, we are Vogue, an international brand, and we want to give the love back by featuring some of the best international celebrities on our covers. Occasionally! :)

Guess whose picture it was 
Selena Gomez and boyfriend The Weeknd made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala this week, and that wasn't the only new record the couple set. 
Gomez posted the below picture to Instagram, and it has since become the most-liked Instagram picture from the Met Gala, even beating Kylie Jenner's all-star cast bathroom selfie. [#image: /photos/5ce446264ea6af521c3be3df]||| ||| Instagram.com/selenagomez 
The black and white snap from the red carpet is set to hit seven million likes on the photo-sharing app. 
In contrast, Kylie Jenner's bathroom selfie (see below) sits at just three million likes.

All the pictures you have to see 
If there's one star who really knows how to use social media, it's Sonam Kapoor. The star has her very own smartphone app, is 100 per cent entertaining on Snapchat, always speaks her mind on Twitter, and is a must-follow personality on Instagram too. 
What makes Kapoor's Insta page fun to track is the mix of content you'll find in there. In the midst of her best beauty looks, dreamiest holiday pictures, edgy red carpet ensembles and picture-perfect promotional posters, the star also takes her fans back to the '90s once in a while with her very special, unseen childhood photos. The best of the lot include snapshots of little Sonam bringing in one birthday after another in frilly dresses, posing as Charlie Chaplin (how spot-on is that costume!) and partying with father Anil Kapoor, mom Sunita Kapoor and her siblings, Rhea and Harshvardhan Kapoor.

How can your heart not melt watching this? 
#worlddanceday #havefeetwilldance #mj dance is in your blood. 
A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Apr 29, 2017 at 1:50am PDT 
Shahid Kapoor is a proud father, that we know for certain. According to his Instagram page, the actor loves spending time in inflatable pools with his toddler, watching sunsets with her and is not immune to the cuteness elicited by her tiny shoe size. 
On World Dance Day, the actor who cut his teeth at Shiamak Davar's classes, imparted his wisdom to his baby daughter. The duo was seen jamming to Michael Jackson on the terrace adjoining Kapoor's bedroom. Misha, who is yet to master gravity, was suspended by a child harness as she mimicked her dad's moves. 
The actor captioned the Instagram video with “#worlddanceday #havefeetwilldance #mj dance is in your blood.” Judging by Misha's sense of rhythm, the toddler sure has inherited her father's genes when it comes to dance. Check out the adorable video here.

Keep a look out for it! 
Just months after creating her much talked about Facebook page, Katrina Kaif launched her official Instagram account on April 27. What made her entry even more special is the warm welcome she received from friends: Mario Testino put up the star's brand new photograph for his Towel Series on the same day, Alia Bhatt was amongst the first to regram Kaif's debut post, and Salman Khan shared an old snapshot of himself with the actor too. 
“There are a few people out there I call ‘Instagram stalkers', who claim not to be on social media, but have these secret handles, and they're watching everything!” she tells us. “I'm not one of those people. When I said I wasn't on Facebook and Instagram, I really wasn't. I didn't even have the app on my phone.” What made her decide to join the world of hashtags and likes? “It would be nice if I had some say in what's put out there about me. It's nice to have your own voice, one that you're in control of.” 
In just a few days, the actor's following has already crossed 900,000, and she too has started following a handful of people including Priyanka Chopra, Karan Johar, Akshay Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan and Anushka Sharma. You can expect that list to grow: “I think I definitely want to follow some really good travel sites,” she muses. “There are some really interesting fitness trainers who do a lot of isolation too, dancers and choreographers… And actors, my friends, I'd follow everyone from the industry. Might as well know what people are doing and posting! Check out their party pictures.” 
As for what's coming up on her page, one will only have to wait and see. But she did reveal one picture she can't wait to share with her fans, a behind-the-scenes moment from Tiger Zinda Hai featuring director Ali Abbas Zafar, which she convinced Aditya Chopra to take in the Yash Raj office canteen. “The hashtag for this particular picture came immediately to my mind. I'm going to caption it ‘This is us, hard at work, prepped for Tiger Zinda Hai playing Settlers of Catan #PhotoByAdityaChopra' because that's the big thing! Very few people get Adi to take pictures. That's going to be a big moment.”

The superstar tells it like it is 
From Richa Chadha to Kiran Bedi, the stage of non-profit foundation TED has seen some very strong Indian personalities share their experiences and inspire listeners with their speeches.

If you've ever watched the Bollywood superstar give an interview, you'll know that Khan is as witty as they come. It's no surprise then that the news of his talk has spread like wildfire online, with many calling it one of the funniest TED Talks ever. Until the official video is released online, here's a peek at some of his funniest and most though-provoking quotes from the event. 
On the business of Bollywood “I sell dreams and I peddle love to millions of people back home in India, who assume that I am the best lover in the world.” 
On racing against time "I looked at my face and realised I am starting to look more and more like my wax statue at Madame Tussauds." 
Want more? Here are three SRK quotes shared by the official TED Talks Twitter page:

Have you seen her first post yet? 
Amongst Bollywood's biggest names, Katrina Kaif is easily one of the most private stars around. The actor seldom speaks out about her life beyond the movie sets, and only joined the Facebook family with her official account last year on her 33rd birthday. 
Today, Kaif takes another big digi step, launching her official Instagram account too. In case you missed it, that's what she was hinting at through her cryptic Facebook selfie, shared yesterday: 
The star has already started posting, and her first picture is a sunny snapshot of herself hanging at the beach, which has earned more than 129,000 likes in two hours, and a regram from Alia Bhatt too.

Get the first look at her new avatar here 
  
While the world buzzes over Kriti Sanon and Sushant Singh Rajput's electric chemistry in upcoming film Raabta, producer Homi Adajania just dropped another surprise on Bollywood fans all over the world with his latest Instagram post. 
Kaboom 💥💥💥 @deepikapadukone in #Raabtasong #everythingisconnected #Raabta #filmshoot #producergiri #comingtoday @maddockfilms #maddockfilms @raabtaofficial #dineshvijan @ipritamofficial 
A post shared by Homi Adajania (@homster) on Apr 26, 2017 at 8:49pm PDT 
Turns out Deepika Padukone (who has worked with Adajania previously in Cocktail too) will appear in the movie too, and as Adajania's captions suggest, the star will be seen performing in one of the film's songs. 
Dressed in a racy black dress featuring thigh-high slits, peek-a-boo details and racer girl-studs by Philipp Plein, Padukone sports sultry smoky eyes and cascading waves against a fiery backdrop that instantly has us wondering which era of the film she will show up in. "I think this is her sexiest moment ever!" says Vogue's Anaita Shroff Adajania. 
What's the story behind Padukone's ultimate vixen look? "I knew this was the dress for Deepika. She showed up a day before we were going to shoot, tried it on, and it was just perfect."

Swimming sessions and perfect poses 
She's amongst Bollywood's biggest (and youngest) superstars today, but Alia Bhatt's love affair with the camera goes way back to a time before anyone knew her name. While the star seldom shares pictures of herself as a toddler on social media, the few that she and her sister Shaheen Bhatt have posted over the years have always received lots of love and attention. 
Amongst Bhatt's best throwback moments: a snapshot of herself striking a pose like a professional (aptly captioned “Poser posing pose”), a picture of the star all dolled up with mother Soni Razdan, an old memory where she's cuddled up with older sister Pooja Bhatt, and a hilarious photograph of her little self taking a dip in the pool to beat the heat.

And how her new project will help others move past grief 
[#image: /photos/5ce449654a30b3818012f92d]||| ||| Cover of Sandberg and Grant's new book; Sheryl Sandberg with Adam Grant 
On May 1, 2015, Sheryl Sandberg lost her husband Dave Goldberg. Almost a month later, at the end of sheloshim (Jewish period of mourning) on June 3, Sandberg wrote a long post on Facebook, that concluded with an anecdote, which went something like this: “I was talking to one of these friends about a father-child activity that Dave is not here to do. We came up with a plan to fill in for Dave. I cried to him, ‘But I want Dave. I want option A.' He put his arm around me and said, ‘Option A is not available. So let's just kick the shit out of option B.' Dave, to honor your memory and raise your children as they deserve to be raised, I promise to do all I can to kick the shit out of option B.” 
The instantly viral post had millions of people writing in from across the world, sharing their own stories of grief, loss and tragedy. Sandberg's post had struck a chord, but most of all, it made her realise the power of sharing stories and so she decided to write a book with her friend, confidante and author Adam Grant on “facing adversity, building resilience and finding joy”. Extracts from an interview with Sandberg: 
In the introduction to your book Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy, you tell your readers why you needed to share your journey. But how did you know you were ready to write this book? The real path to the book was the post I wrote on Facebook 30 days after Dave died. It was not just the overwhelming grief, but the isolation of all those relationships I took for granted before—my neighbours, colleagues, friends, even family—that suddenly became awkward because we didn't know how to communicate. The post was my way of telling them how I was feeling, and it really helped. And it was the response to that post that made me want to write this book. 
You begin the book by sharing the story of your friend who is a rape survivor, and how you reached out to her. What made you want to deal with the issue of communicating with someone going through trauma so directly? Option B is also for people who are trying to help those who are going through adversity. Before I lost Dave, if I knew someone was going through something hard, I would probably mention it once and wouldn't bring it up again. I was afraid I would remind them of their pain. But going through what I did made me realise how ludicrous that idea was, bringing it up doesn't remind me that I lost Dave, I live with that. Or little things like rather than saying is there anything I can do, just do something concrete. My friend lost his son, and a friend of his texted him saying I'm downstairs for an hour in case you feel like coming down for a hug. 
OptionB.org, a platform to connect people who are coping with similar challenges, launches with the book. What are your plans for this organisation? Following the mantra of Lean In, where we created a global community of over 1.5 million members, with Option B we want to give people a safe space to share what they're going through, be it the loss of a child or parent, sexual assault or violence. We have an incredible advisory board of experts who will help people out, along with our partner organisations that help us point out members to the right places for the right help. 
This is a book written by both you and Adam [Grant]; your insights, his research. Could you tell us a little more about the collaboration? Adam is one of the most brilliant people I know and a truly incredible friend. We wrote a series of New York Times Op Eds together and it was one of the best collaborations I've ever had. He's the first person I turned to for advice after Dave died. I asked him, “What can I do? How can I help my kids?” He came back with piles of research and actual steps I could take to help me and my kids cope with our loss. He taught me about all the things I could do to make this better. It was a healing process for me to write this book with him. Apart from thinking of myself, the book made me think of others and their stories inspired me. 
Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant (Penguin Random House) was published on April 24. Optionb.org

Did you miss this Insta conversation? 
Amongst India's cricket couples, Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli (better known on social media as #Virushka) are right on top of the everyone's must-follow list. Whether the two are enjoying a quiet dinner, walking the red carpet at Vogue's Beauty Awards, or spending quality time on vacation, they always manage to cause major excitement on the internet. 
If you're not up to date with the duo's latest happenings, Kohli confirmed all rumours about his relationship with Sharma on Valentine's Day with a breezy but impactful Instagram post dedicated to his beau, then followed it up with an equally powerful post wishing her a happy Women's Day. And to top it all off, the sports star recently changed his Instagram display picture to one of him with Sharma at Yuvraj Singh's wedding (check it out below). 
Think that's as cute as they get? There's more. Kohli just posted a selfie showing off a full beard, stating that while his friends Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya and Ravindrasinh Jadeja look great after shaving, he's not getting rid of his facial hair anytime soon. And it turns out Sharma's not letting him experiment either! The star commented saying, “You cannot” and got a prompt (and very adorable) reply from Kohli too. Find out what he said here before you share this with your girlfriends.

Hint: It’s the ideal summer activity 
Born on August 26, it's hard to believe Shahid and Mira Kapoor's very first child, Misha Kapoor, is already eight months old today. And while she may not know it, the toddler is a Bollywood obsession, just like Kareena Kapoor Khan's son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi. Case in point: Every time a photograph of the little girl surfaces online (whether it's just a snapshot of her feet in comfy little booties, or that picture-perfect moment caught with mom Mira), it goes viral within minutes. 
The latest picture of the star kid to take over the internet is the snapshot that shows her enjoying some quality time with her father in her baby-proof inflatable pool. With Mumbai's scorching summer at its peak right now, one can't think of a better way to spend the day. Don't miss Kapoor's caption, and scroll to check out his baby's cutest Instagram moments so far.

Guess who Priyanka Chopra has been hanging out with 
Girl on fire Priyanka Chopra is living her last few days as a New Yorker to the fullest. The crossover star was recently spotted with Hollywood legends Whoopi Goldberg and Robert De Niro, and producer Jane Rosenthal. Chopra is a part of the jury at the Tribeca Film Festival along with other celebrities and critics. 
Cristina Ehrlich styled her for the occasion in a white 3.1 Phillip Lim ensemble and a navy Burberry trench that was draped across her shoulders. Needless to say, Chopra was thrilled to be a part of the jury and posted a photo captioned ‘An afternoon with the greats'.

“It’s easy for me to block and report you and I’ve done that liberally” 
Sonam Kapoor is famous, not only for her unapologetic sartorial choices, her superstardom, and now, critically acclaimed performances (National award et al), but also for her incredible social media presence. With great power comes great responsibility, and she seems to be fed up of all those trolls on social media bringing her down. “The trolls can be sexist and judgmental but I know I'm smart and capable of expressing an opinion,” she said in an editorial written by her for a leading daily. 
As a successful woman in Bollywood, and business, Kapoor feels no regret about putting her life out there, and speaking up against what she believes in, “I've spoken up often. I spoke up when the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film, Padmavati, were vandalised. I have spoken up against meat bans. I've taken sides with my colleagues and spoken up when Sonakshi Sinha was fat-shamed or Anushka Sharma, an amazingly talented actress, was picked on only because people think they have the right to comment on our sizes or our boyfriends.” 
In addition, she urges said trolls to loosen up, and cut the crap, “I will always speak up. I am not a bimbo. When you use that word, it reflects on you, not me. Let's loosen up guys. Let's be witty; let's engage, let's agree to disagree; let's cut out the abuse.” 
That's a message we can all get behind.

Shehla Chatoor’s designs with satisfy the maximalist in you 
Statement-making trailing jackets, intricate embroidery and a touch of gold are striking elements of designer Shehla Chatoor's work. A distinct '70s glam vibe is persistent through her designs, even more so in her newest collection ‘Shahnameh'. 
Shahnameh is an epic poem by the Persian poet Ferdowsi, and Chatoor draws inspiration from the traditions and celebrations mentioned in it. Tapestries also influence the collection, which is evident in the prints seen through the line. 
The colour palette ranges from soft beiges to powder blues and blacks accentuated with gold. Chatoor's collection is for the brave—flared embellished trousers paired with a voluminous blouse is not an easy look to carry off, but it does have the desired lasting effect on memory.

Inside the Kapoor sisters’ birthday lunch with mom Babita Kapoor 
When it comes to making their parents feel special, Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan are model kids. The siblings lit up their father's 70th birthday earlier this year with a star-studded celebration, and brought in their mom's 70th on the evening of April 19 with a family-only get together at home. 
Wondering how the family spent the day after Babita Kapoor's midnight party? The sisters treated their mom to an intimate lunch at Mumbai's Hakkasan and were joined by Kapoor's kids, Viaan Raj and Samaira Kapur too. While the birthday girl picked a baby pink blouse for her big day, new mom Kareena opted for an edgy blue shirt featuring an open back and cut-out details on the sleeves, and Karisma twinned with her daughter in polka dots. Check out all the pictures here, and don't miss the throwback collage Karisma just shared of her mom's most memorable onscreen avatars.

Did you see how Karan Johar wished the couple? 
Ever since Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan tied the knot back in 2007, they jumped straight to the top of Bollywood's list of most-loved couples. (Did you miss their very first photo shoot as a married couple for Vogue India?) 
This Thursday, April 20, marked the duo's 10th wedding anniversary. Instead of bringing in the milestone moment with a lavish party or secret getaway, the Bachchans chose to celebrate their special day with an afternoon trip to Mumbai's Siddhivinayak Temple with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan in tow.

Find out in the trailer of ‘Raabta’ 
It's been months since news about Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon coming together in a Bollywood film first broke. Then came the confirmation on the movie's name, Raabta, followed by a series of super romantic movie stills that have had fans waiting with bated breath for more. 
Over the last two days, both Sanon and Rajput have been shooting out reminders about the launch of Raabta's trailer, which finally hit YouTube today. If you, like us, were expecting a dreamy, modern-day romance in a big city, the trailer is no disappointment at all. But what makes it even more exciting is its darker side. 
From the makers of Cocktail and Love Aaj Kal, Raabta seems to follow the same vibe as the latter film, drawing parallels between Rajput and Sanon's love story today and their romance from another era decades ago. While in one frame you'll see the couple slow dancing in a crowded train, the next will have you face-to-face with an almost unrecognisable warrior version of Rajput. Add to that a love triangle with Jim Sarbh (of Neerja fame), and you've got yourself a potential blockbuster. Watch the trailer now!

Everything you need to catch up on right now 
This week, Instagram brought some very interesting throwbacks into the spotlight. Sonam Kapoor celebrated Charlie Chaplin's birthday with an old photograph of herself dressed as the comedian, Karisma Kapoor looked back at one of her most iconic Bollywood roles ever, Kim Kardashian took us back to her teens for National Siblings Day, and both Arjun Kapoor and Arpita Khan Sharma shared rare snapshots of themselves as toddlers. 
While Athiya Shetty, Alia Bhatt and Twinkle Khanna beat the summer heat by hanging out at home (the first gorging on mangoes in her garden, the second lounging in bed with her new kitten Edward, and the third taking selfies with her dog Cleo), other stars gave the world lots of travel inspiration with their holiday pictures. Head to the south of France like Sushmita Sen if you're into great food, check out Thailand's amazing architecture like Sophie Choudry, shop your heart out a la Pooja Hegde in Malaysia, or escape to Milan like Gauri Khan.

Everything you need to know about the controversy 
Quotes allegedly made by Snapchat's CEO Evan Spiegel surfaced this weekend, claiming that the social media company will not consider expansion in India as the “app is only for rich people”. 
The statement is part of a lawsuit that ex-employee Anthony Pompliano has filed against the parent company, Snap Inc, that was recently made public. According to Pompliano, when he presented ways to push the app overseas (where it hasn't been doing well), Spiegel responded saying, “This app is only for rich people… I don't want to expand into poor countries like Indian and Spain.” The lawsuit by Pomplaino alleges Snap has presented fake, bloated numbers to advertisers, and hasn't seen the growth it claims to have. 
The "poor countries" quote by Spiegel has predictably caused a huge backlash amongst users in India. Hashtags like #BoycottSnapchat and #UninstallSnapchat were trending through the weekend, and the ratings for the app took a hit on both Play Store and iTunes. 
Snap has denied any such statement was made by Spiegel in an effort to stall the damage, calling Pompliano, who was in Snap's employ for a short stint of three weeks, “a disgruntled former employee.” “Obviously, Snapchat is for everyone!” a Snap spokesperson said on Sunday in a press briefing. “It's available worldwide to download for free. Those words were written by a disgruntled former employee. We are grateful for our Snapchat community in India and around the world.” 
In an unfortunate turn of events, Indian app Snapdeal was caught in the crossfire between the social forum and irate Indians who uninstalled and down-rated the e-commerce platform, confusing it for Snapchat. Snapdeal CEO Kunal Bahl took to Twitter to express his thoughts on the issue. 
@thetanmay Thanks bud. Ppl asking us to make a statement that @snapdeal is not @snapchat was possibly the last thing I thought I would ever need to do. 
— Kunal Bahl (@1kunalbahl) April 16, 2017 
Here is how people reacted to the controversy on Twitter: 
I felt this tide of fury at the Snapchat CEO but then it was gone in ten seconds. 
— Rohan (@mojorojo) April 15, 2017 
I actually get why Snapchat doesn't wanna expand in india, donno why people are offended.

Which award did Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor just win? 
After the HT Most Stylish Awards and Hello! Hall of Fame Awards, April 12 saw yet another red carpet roll out for Bollywood's best. 
The Lokmat Maharashtrian of the Year Awards took place last night in Mumbai, and the event was attended by winners Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor. Both actors earned themselves the title of ‘Outstanding Entertainer of the Year'. Joining them at the event were Shaina NC, producer Divya Kumar Khosla, director Rajkumar Hirani, former president of India Pratibha Patil and India's Minister of Home Affairs, Rajnath Singh. 
Very rarely does Bhatt skip the summer dresses, jumpsuits or glitzy gowns on a night out, but the occasion was perfect for her to wing a traditional look. Her choice for the evening: a sparkling gold kurta worn with sharara pants and a sheer dupatta. Kapoor too picked a semi-ethnic look in shades of white, maroon and navy blue. 
While the two stars haven't featured in a movie together yet, you will see them sharing a frame soon with Amitabh Bachchan in Ayan Mukerji's upcoming superhero film, Dragon. But first, get geared up for Kapoor in Hirani's biopic based on Sanjay Dutt's life. That's going to be one to watch out for.

Have you watched her video yet? 
In the recent past, Bollywood released quite a few women-centric movies for its audience like Dangal, Pink, Mary Kom and Neerja. Just this week, the Sonam Kapoor-starrer even swept a National Award for Best Film. 
Sonakshi Sinha's upcoming project, Noor, follows the trend, spotlighting a strong female protagonist. The only difference: Noor has Sinha playing a lighter, more bubbly character than the films before it. Promotions of the upcoming feature have already started in full swing. Earlier today, the Bollywood star took to her Twitter account to post a video. 
If you've ever had issues with your weight, Sinha's message is meant to reach out to you. Talking about her struggles, she plays out her character from the movie in a lighthearted manner, dissing salads, hating her time at the gym, and bemoaning the fact that she might have to give up on beer and junk food. Whether you relate to or agree with her message or not, it puts the spotlight on a matter that plays on young girls' minds more frequently than not. We're waiting to see what the teaser leads to next.

Can you recognise her? 
In the midst of all their FOMO-inducing vacation pictures, hottest red carpet ensembles and posters of their latest projects, Bollywood's biggest stars like to give their fans a glimpse into their personal lives once in a while with an adorable childhood picture or two. 
For Sonakshi Sinha, sharing throwback shots has been a fun activity ever since she first joined Instagram. All chubby cheeks and sparkly eyes, photographs of Sinha's mini avatar never fail to earn her lots of likes and comments. One of them has her in a short fringe and frilly frock, with a caption reminding herself to have a chat with her mother to get to the bottom of a look she calls a "disaster" (let's face it, we've all been there). Another is an old postcard with the entire family (including her twin brothers, Luv and Kush Sinha—in matching outfits, of course), where she is sleeping soundly through the photoshoot in her mother's arms. 
Some more of our favourite flashbacks: a collection of photo frames featuring the star as a toddler, posing for the camera, and that class photograph from Sinha's Arya Vidya Mandir days. Look carefully and see if you can spot her in the group shot.

These pictures are adorable 
Not a week goes by without Priyanka Chopra making the headlines. Recently, she had the world's attention for jumping into an impromptu Holi party with Jimmy Fallon. And then there was her celebrating as her venture into production, the Marathi movie Ventilator, swept three National Awards. 
But between fulfilling her Bollywood commitments and juggling her Hollywood career (including hanging out with co-stars Zac Efron and Dwayne Johnson, and casually taking pictures backstage with Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lopez), the star someone manages to clock in some alone time to de-stress and unwind. The favourite company of choice? Apart from her puppy Diana (who has her own Instagram account, by the way), it's her adorable baby nieces Krishna Sky and Shireen Shiva Rose. It is evident that like all of us with baby nieces and nephews, the global icon is obsessed with hers. All you need to do is scroll through her Instagram account, and you'll find Chopra being the perfectly besotted aunt—playing with them, catching a nap and cuddling with the little munchkins. Check out all their cutest moments in our slideshow.

Major throwbacks and party pictures 
This week was a busy one for Bollywood. While Shamita Shetty and Shilpa Shetty Kundra hopped on a flight for a cruise wedding overseas, Sonam Kapoor and her family celebrated Neerja winning a National Film Award, and Arjun Kapoor proudly shared the latest poster from his upcoming film, Half Girlfriend. 
That's not all. Karan Johar partied this weekend with his favourite Bollywood friends (including Shah Rukh Khan, Alia Bhatt, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh) in honour of French shoe designer Christian Louboutin, and the Kapoor sisters spent a sunny day by the pool lunching with their mom Babita. Overseas, Ileana D'Cruz grabbed a bite in Covent Garden, Pooja Hegde roamed around Istanbul and Gauri Khan discovered the best decor details at the Milan Fair. 
This week also featured three very interesting throwbacks. Don't miss Deepika Padukone's adorable childhood snapshot featuring little sister Anisha, Priyanka Chopra's video clip of her late father singing for guests at a family party, and Abhishek Bachchan's #FlashbackFriday with Kareena Kapoor Khan from the sets of their debut Bollywood movie, Refugee.

Rest in peace 
I got to know Raudha Athif when we reached out to her for Vogue India's ninth anniversary special in October 2016, where six gorgeous models from the Indian subcontinent were featured on the cover, celebrating beauty in diversity. The 20-year-old stunner was discovered by our beauty editor, Nidhi Sharma Punjabi, who, like the rest of the social media world, was mesmerised by her unique beauty, especially her eyes (a picture popularly referred to as the ‘Maldivian Girl With Aqua Blue Eyes', shot by Maldivian photographer Sotti for a project with artist Alexey Vladimir, went viral as soon as it was released). 
Tracking Athif down wasn't easy (I learnt later she was shuttling between her home in the Maldives and Bangladesh, where she was completing her MBBS), but we finally connected via Facebook. Athif was in the middle of an exam at that time, and what struck me then and continued to stay with me for a long time, is the fact that she wasn't willing to let anything come in the way of her achieving her childhood dream of becoming a doctor and helping people. She was even willing to forego this Vogue cover if the dates clashed with her exams. Modelling was just a hobby for her. 
Fortunately, it worked out for both of us. Eventually, in the course of our conversations while coordinating her schedule for the shoot and finally interviewing her for the cover, we became friendly. She was a warm, kind-hearted soul, not really interested in the potential of her beauty and where it could take her. She was clear about her priorities. 
In October, when the cover was finally out, she was ecstatic. Not because she'd changed her mind about the fashion world, but more because of how the whole shoot turned out, the experience she'd had with the other five cover girls and our Vogue crew, thanking the team for never giving up on our chase to get her for this cover. She was in love not so much with her pictures, but with the concept of celebrating models with unconventional good looks from the neighbouring countries. 
When the news broke out of her passing away, the team was stunned. In trying to process the suddenness of her death and the unusual circumstances that surrounded the incident, we respected the sentiments of her parents and refrained from making a knee-jerk statement. Reports over the last few days say that she may have been depressed, but her pictures on Facebook as well as her Instagram posts seem to suggest otherwise. Now we hear friends and family are suspecting foul play. 
Whatever the circumstances surrounding this tragedy, a beautiful soul is lost. And we feel lucky to have had the opportunity to work with her. Rest in peace, Raudha Athif.

This Bollywood couple never gets boring 
It's been 16 years since they got hitched, but Twinkle Khanna and Akshay Kumar still know how to keep the spark in their marriage alive. 
If you follow them on Instagram, you've seen them post some really cute pictures with each other every now and then. And if you're a Koffee With Karan fan, there's no forgetting how Kumar surprised his wife with a romantic singing-and-slow-dancing-session this season, or the way that Khanna referred to her husband as "six feet of chocolate ice-cream" during her interview. 
Now, the couple are trending on Twitter for this adorable exchange of messages. Khanna spent a day with Google and its new phone, and Kumar promptly showed his support with this tweet… 
This is what happens when Google googles your wife 😜 https://t.co/Hh301CZhTn 
— Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) April 3, 2017 
… to which Khanna showed her gratitude with this loved-up response. 
Thank you for being the handsomest cheerleader a girl could have on her team and my pom poms are 'Eveready' for you too #MumbaiToMaheshwar https://t.co/Z6tXz49FaW

This elegant new boutique mithai service is perfect for gifting 
“Real mithai is undervalued. We wanted to bring back the art of making mithai—pure, traditional and handmade,” says New Delhi-based Sid Mathur about his new project. Mathur knows what he's talking about—the former banker is also the director, food and beverage – Impressario Group (the people who've brought us Social and Smoke House Delhi, to name a few). Along with recipes curated by his wife Batasha, Mathur set out to create a bespoke box of luxury mithai—think your grandmother's ladoos, but beautifully packaged. 
“We use 100 per cent natural or organic ingredients with no added flavours, preservatives or colourings. We did extensive research for almost a year, and carefully selected age-old recipes and traditional methods,” he says. 
They currently have on offer 12 varieties ranging from a brown sugar besan ladoo and Belgian chocolate barfi to paan pedas. We're particularly partial to the beet-pink motichoor ladoo and the sugar-free date-and-nut barfi. 
“The best validation was when a few days post our launch, one of the country's leading mithai chains called in for a large order. Now that was quite something,” says Mathur. 
Smaller orders need a day's notice. Bulk orders can take a couple of days. Khoyamithai.com or call 09810120663

Sonam Kapoor, Alia Bhatt or Priyanka Chopra—whose would you pick? 
Almost every celebrity around the world has a signature beauty look—it becomes their go-to and eventually is also what they're known for. And it goes without saying that they're probably using some of the best beauty products to achieve it. While many celebrities in the West (including Kylie Jenner, Drew Barrymore, Rihanna and Miranda Kerr) have launched their own beauty lines, we haven't seen too many Indian celebrities follow suit, individually or in collaboration with a larger brand. So we thought we'd chalk up a few suggestions for some of our favourite ladies in Bollywood, if they ever decided to venture into the business of beauty.

The two actors are now all set to reunite for a new project, Tiger Zinda Hai, a sequel to the last. Salman Khan broke the news recently on his social media page with this movie shot.

It's a start of a new year and I'm always thankful for the opportunities I am given and the fact that I have a career that helps me better my fellow brothers and sisters from around the world no matter the ethnic background, beliefs or religion.

The latest Khan-related topic to catch the attention of her fans: this picture-perfect image of her standing side by side with Ranbir Kapoor at the Global Teacher Prize gala in Dubai. Both the stars attended the event to represent their countries and give speeches, and immediately stirred up rumours and hopes of them working together in the near future. 
Dressed in a red beaded ensemble by Pakistani designer Faraz Manan, Khan was also spotted in the midst of an animated conversation with Kapoor later at the event. While the world continues to speculate over what the discussion was about (some reports state Khan and Kapoor were just catching up on work, while others wonder if they were acting out a script), check out the stars' best moments together in our slideshow.

Become besties with Alia Bhatt through this brand new game 
With close to 14 million Instagram followers and a quirky, devil-may-care attitude, Alia Bhatt is definitely a millennial favourite. 
It comes as no surprise then that the star is taking her digi reign to the next level with a brand new game. Launching today, ‘Alia Bhatt: Star Life' gives fans a playful peek into Bhatt's life by letting you join her in an animated world full of Bollywood-style situations. "I can't express my excitement enough to launch this game and offer my fans a fun way to experience life in the movie universe,” Bhatt says. "While it's my game, I feel the best part is that it places the fan upfront and centre and provides a wonderful experience. I first met the Moonfrog team in Goa around a year ago when I was filming Dear Zindagi and it's been amazing to see just how much work goes into building a game that works on so many interesting levels." What makes the game special? Not only does it take inspiration from Bhatt's personal life (spoiler alert: You'll first bump into the animal lover as she searches for her lost cat), it turns Bhatt into your personal career mentor quite like the 'Kim Kardashian: Hollywood' game released in 2014. As soon as you befriend her, the actor guides you from shoots to page 3 parties and more all over the globe to complete acting, dancing, singing and networking-related tasks that earn you cash, diamonds and stars, all while switching between some envy-worthy ensembles and fighting off Monika Malhotra, your new nemesis. And yes, you'll also find yourself working with the country's coolest photographers, designers and directors, hiring a much-needed publicist, and working out to stay fit. Doesn't get realer than that. For the hardcore Bhatt fans, there's one more element that will keep you coming back. Dressed in a summery blue and pink dress almost exactly like this Sachin & Babi number she wore back in 2016, Bhatt doesn't just send you written messages through the game, she speaks to you too! Crank up the volume to hear her encouraging you to take over Bollywood, one level at a time. 
'Alia Bhatt: Star Life' is the intellectual property of Moonfrog Labs Pvt Ltd and is available on Google Play and Apple App Store.

Pat McGrath’s newest launch is every eye make-up lover’s dream kit 
Pat McGrath sure knows how to keep us guessing—she's been teasing her new launch all over Instagram through all the fashion weeks, keeping us wanting to know more. Let's be honest, besides her insanely beautiful work, we've been in love with the woman's venture into make-up ever since she launched the first Gold 001 pigment—it's the dreamiest gold we've ever seen. Then came the eight-piece pop-coloured Phantom 002 eye kit, followed by the ultimate highlighter set, Skin Fetish 003. Nothing had us as hooked as the Lust 004 lip kit though—we're still lusting over the glimmer of it all. After that was the Metalmorphosis 005, which brought back the Gold 001 pigment with all its other metallic siblings. 
Now, keep your credit cards ready and schedule a reminder on your calendar on April 11 for drumroll, please Dark Star 006. Another addition to her line-up of eye kits, this Pat McGrath Labs launch has three variants, just like the Lust 004. Keeping up with the holographic make-up trend, the Dark Matter kit ($95/Rs 6,221) comes with the basics of this collection—three blending pigments: a shimmer black called Dark Matter, a soft gold called Mercury and Astral White, a unicorn-like white hue; a holographic Cyber Clear eye gloss; a blender blush and a creamy kohl stick. The UltraViolet Blue kit ($130/Rs 8,514) contains all the contents of Dark Matter along with a namesake bold violet and cobalt eyeshadow while the UltraSuede Brown kit ($130/Rs 8,514) comes with a highly-pigmented sparkling brown eyeshadow of the same name. If the eye make-up looks at Anna Sui and Prada are anything to go by, we're all definitely in for a treat.

The icon pens his thoughts 
After months of battling with lymphoma, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's father, Krishnaraj Rai passed away on the evening of March 18. 
Amongst the many impacted by the army biologist's death is Amitabh Bachchan, who penned his thoughts via an emotional letter shared on his blog. If you've ever felt loss, you'll be able to identify with Bachchan's entry, an observation on the happenings after one's demise. Don't miss the positive lesson at the end. 
Death .. the inevitable end 
That call you wait anxiously knowing that it will come, and come it does to end all other calls .. glimpses of reactions in the mind, of the lost one, of those that shall reflect on the lost one .. and suddenly then in the midst of sorrow and grief among the grieved and grieving .. 
That walk to the ultimate destination and the reality .. embracing the tragedy, the discussions on its transport, its rituals, its formalities .. the custom, the tradition, the visitors with the sadness and the embrace of consolation .. the last rites, the carriage, the placement, the cremation .. what to say what to put out where to put to .. all laden with grief and departure .. 
And the happiest of them all, is the one that has gone .. for he is already in the arms of the heavens and in a realm of peace and tranquility .. 
In grief .. 
Amitabh Bachchan 
The icon also shared in his daughter in law's pain with the following tweets: 
T 2468 - Death has but one end .. and words cannot define it ..!! 
— Amitabh Bachchan (@SrBachchan) March 18, 2017 
T 2469 - To them that express condolence on the passing of Aishwarya's Father .. my gratitude .. !🙏 pic.twitter.com/aiLUhiTqxM

Adding another feather to her cap 
Global domination seems to be the new normal—from dabbing into cinema in the west to lending their faces to Indian and international brands as ambassadors, Bollywood's leading ladies are on a roll at the moment. One of the actors front-running this league is Deepika Padukone, who just recently aced her Hollywood debut with xXx: Return of Xander Cage. And now, it seems like she may be joining Aishwarya Rai and Sonam Kapoor as L'Oréal Paris' Indian line-up of ambassadors. There hasn't been an official confirmation as yet, but the brand teased a new face on March 18 on their social media channels, with the image of a woman covering her most of her face with a hat and copy that said “Guess who's going to Paris?” 
Soon after, popular celebrity hairstylist Gabriel Georgiou posted the L'Oréal Paris' teaser on his Instagram and tagged Padukone on it. 
To add to the mix, Padukone's stylist Shaleena Nathani posted the same image, without naming anyone, however. Does Padukone join L'Oréal Paris' illustrious line-up of spokespeople that includes international favourites like Blake Lively, Eva Longoria, Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts, Zoe Saldana and more? We're keeping a lookout for official news from the brand soon.

Gucci just hired professional meme makers, are now making memes 
If there was ever a fashion house willing to embrace mocking themselves, it would be Gucci. 
With an anything goes attitude and very internet-friendly approach to maximalism, Alessandro Michele's Gucci has become the calling card for the millennial cool kid. So the fact they're making memes is not necessarily a surprise. 
In a clever advertisement for Gucci timepieces, the Italian heritage brand has enlisted the help of ‘international meme creators' to help them create an online advertising campaign based around memes. 
With further help from artists and other Instagram users (think @textsfromyourexistentialist and @beigecardigan) the memes are lol-inducing at their best, taking everyday things and turning them into Gucci-related pockets of humour. 
Including lines like “When you get a Gucci watch and have to show it off” next to a picture of a sleeve of a shirt with a watch-sized rip in it, and “When he buys you flowers instead of a Gucci watch” alongside a Gothic-esque classical painting, the memes are the ultimate #troll coming from an otherwise traditional brand. 
Of the collaborations, Gucci posted the following to Instagram: “Debuting #TFWGucci (That Feel When Gucci). The House's new collaborative art project in the digital space is a line-up of memes featuring the new #LeMarchédesMerveilles collection of watches.” 
See our favourite memes above.

How many vacations and awards can one girl handle? 
Life in Alia Bhatt's shoes is anything but basic. 
Since her last birthday, the star has had one of her most eventful years yet. First there were the releases: four major movies starting with Kapoor & Sons, moving on to Udta Punjab, Dear Zindagi and finally, Badrinath Ki Dulhania. 
Add to that the many, many awards Bhatt has collected in the same amount of time (we've counted one Filmfare, two Star Screen trophies and most recently, a shining Zee Cine Award too), and you can bet she must be pretty pleased with herself. 
Think a girl can't fit more than that into 365 days? Stalk the star on Instagram and you'll also spot some major FOMO-inducing travel shots spanning Jodhpur, the Maldives and more. Catch up on all the action here.

Want a perfume to go with your favourite MAC lipstick? Check these out 
There aren't too many brands with a cult following for their lipsticks like MAC Cosmetics'. Whether it's a lipstick fanatic or someone who simply sticks to the basics, almost everyone owns at least one, and loves it. The brand has now launched a line of fragrances called Shadescents to go with six of their widely-loved colours. While this isn't the first time for MAC to dabble into the world of fragrances—the sweet smell of vanilla infused in all their lipsticks is a definite winner in our eyes anyway—this is the first ever line that'll be available in India. 
Priced at Rs 4,500, each scent is a heady concoction, meant for a different occasion and mood, as are the lipsticks. While Candy Yum-Yum (a matte neon pink) smells exactly like it sounds with notes of tropical fruits and cotton candy, Lady Danger (a matte red-orange) makes for the perfect evening fragrance with deep notes of wild cherry. We'd always keep our Ruby Woo (a blue-toned red) handy—the lipstick and the fragrance, that is—for the weekend at the club. If you're feeling experimental, invest in My Heroine (a matte purple) for spicy, leather notes, but if you'd rather stick to the basics, Crème D'Nude (a creamy peach) will become your everyday favourite without being overly fresh. If none of these float your boat, Velvet Teddy (a matte, dark beige) will keep you wanting more of its honey notes for sure. 
MAC Shadescents fragrances are available at all MAC stores nationwide

Paints, thandai and more 
The last time we saw Priyanka Chopra on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, she was decked out in goggles, competing against Fallon himself at bobbing for apples. This time around, the star topped her last appearance by playing Holi with the TV show host in front of a live audience. 
All Chopra had to do was mention she was feeling particularly homesick on the day of her interview as everyone in India was celebrating Holi, and Fallon brought out a platter of paints and glasses of thandai to cheer her up. 
“Holi is the Hindu festival evoking spring, celebrating spring, the triumph of good over evil,” Chopra explained to Fallon on the show. “It's just a big party with lots of colours. You have coloured powder and you colour each other. There are a lot of various other elements involved.” Fallon's awestruck response: “Looks like a giant rave!” 
If you follow Chopra on Instagram, you've already seen the result of her mini Holi party with Fallon. Scroll below this picture for a video of what really went down at the show. 
Happy Holi with @jimmyfallon tonight!! U should see what he looks like! Lol 🍭Tune in tonight at 11:35 EST

Huemn’s latest campaign is about finding common ground in diversity 
Vogue India Fashion Fund winners Pranav Mishra and Shyma Shetty of Huemn discovered the German-born American poet Charles Bukowski in 2012. Drawn to his prolific work in dirty realism, the designers decided to use his portrait as a print on one of their shirts for their autumn/winter 2014 collection. “The portrait we used belonged to the photographer Mark Hanauer. Over the years we've become friends and wanted to collaborate with him on a larger scale,” said Mishra. 
This season, the designers were trying to define the brand Huemn. “In fashion we have an affinity to chase celebrity. Everyday stories have just as much to celebrate if you take the time to hear them, so we decided to work on a series of portraits with Mark,” he further explains the campaign for autumn/winter 2017. 
There's no doubt that the brand is growing stronger with every season and this time it is visible through the various people whose stories they share through the campaign. “It's really about celebrating choice,” says Mishra. From a young man transitioning to a woman, to a photographer in search of his true calling and a woman who finds comfort and liberation in a hijab, Huemn is telling stories that need to be heard. 
“The whole agenda of this collection is to show how beautiful it is to be different,” concludes Mishra. 
Huemn will present its autumn/winter 2017 collection at Amazon India Fashion Week on March 16 at 4:00pm

Hold your breath, Virushka fans 
After months and months of on-again, off-again rumours, Virat Kohli quietly confirmed his relationship with Anushka Sharma a day after Valentine's Day this year with this belated post. No hearts or cakes required, this one immediately topped everyone's list of favourite V-Day posts all thanks to its simplicity, and adorably honest caption. 
Everyday is a valentine day if you want it to be. You make everyday seem like one for me ❤❤. @anushkasharma

And if you had any doubts left about Kohli's respect and appreciation for the Bollywood star, there's this (very timely) Women's Day post, shared by the cricket pro just a little over an hour ago. 
What makes Kohli's Instagram twice as special: The fact that he split his post between “the two strongest women in my life”: girlfriend Sharma, and his mother, Saroj Kohli. Read the complete message below before you share! 
Happy women's day to every woman out there, but specially to the two strongest women in my life. My mom for looking after the family in toughest times in life and @anushkasharma for fighting against the odds regularly and standing up for righteousness and changing the norms ❤#happywomenday

So empowering! 
A friend recently posted a status on Facebook that says: “Every day is women's day... If it isn't then you're doing life wrong. #JustSaying.” While we all should be hitting this sentiment hard and rewiring our DNA until this is true for everyone, International Women's Day is a great way to celebrate each and every milestone achieved for something that we've been fighting for all of our lives. Thanks to social media, we all now have access to all our favourite celebrities and most often, they share inspiring words and images. In honour of this day, we have curated some of the inspiring celebrity posts from our feed—whether it was them saluting the women they love, coming together and getting their red on (in solidarity with the Day Without Women protest) or even simply stating that women are everything. 
Anushka Sharma's message about women supporting women couldn't be more true, how do we expect to get ahead if we go around pinning each other down? Adele posted a powerful image of a woman juggling life on a unicycle while being completely balanced. Deepika Padukone reposted her Love Laugh Foundation's message about the women who work tirelessly to bring mental health care to communities in rural Karnataka. Check out our slideshow for more.

"My children are my world" 
When he launched his biography An Unsuitable Boy last month, Karan Johar mentioned he'd like to be a parent someday. But his fans didn't know 'someday' would come so soon. 
The Bollywood director just released a statement confirming that he has now become the proud father of twins via surrogacy, and named them Yash and Roohi Johar, the former after his late father, and the latter's name an anagram of his mother's name, Hiroo. The twins were born last month, delivered by Dr Makrand Masani at the same Mumbai-based hospital as Shah Rukh Khan's youngest son, AbRam. 
Johar's took to Twitter to talk about the new additions to his family, "I am ecstatic to share with you all the two most wonderful additions to my life, my children and life lines; Roohi and Yash. I feel enormously blessed to be a parent to these pieces of my heart who were welcomed into this world with the help of the marvels of medical science." 
Johar's Bollywood friends including Alia Bhatt and Farah Khan have already started celebrating the littlest members of his family. Here's congratulating the new dad!

Two words: laugh riot 
If you haven't been living under a rock, you will know Mallika Dua. The comedienne shot to fame with her knack for impersonations—from playing “Delhi girls” at the capital's favourite pedestrian shopping destination, Sarojini Nagar, to showcasing make-up mishaps courtesy her role as Make-Up Didi, the girl has range. 
Known for her desi flair and deadpan comedic style, this 26-year-old copywriter-turned-internet star has elicited comparisons with Amy Schumer. Dua's brand of comedy is often radical with specks of raucous feminist humour, but all under a garb of slapstick. She's come a long way from her Dubsmash debut—these days, when she is not creating her own viral gold videos, the gag queen can be seen performing skits with All India Bakchod (Watch her latest video here). 
So when Vogue decided to unleash the eminently funny Dua onto our equally badass (and hilarious) cover girl Anushka Sharma, we knew the results would be riotous. Dua and Sharma bond over everything from career choices to chakna. On filming the video with Sharma, Dua says, "I thought she is so much like me. She's a complete ball of energy and fire on screen and calm, composed and chill off screen. It's so heartening to see a non-industry bred making it so big at such a young age. It goes to show girls can do anything. She was one of the first people to message me appreciating my work and I will never forget that." With many kill-me-now sidesplitting moments, it's difficult to tell who is our favourite funny woman. Watch it here.

The trolling has crossed limits of what’s acceptable or permissible 
“I'm withdrawing from the campaign. Congratulations everyone. I said what I had to say. I have been through a lot and this is all that my 20 year old self could take. This campaign was never about me but students. Please go in huge numbers for the March. Best of luck. To anyone questioning my courage and bravery I have shown enough. One thing is for sure that we will think twice before resorting to threats and violence and this is all that this was about. I request to be left alone.” 
With this statement on Facebook and Twitter, Gurmehar Kaur ended her online campaign against the ABVP, which she launched after the clashes that took place at the Delhi University's Ramjas College between the college students and activists of the students' organisation on February 22. Kaur's #StudentsAgainstABVP campaign went viral on social media; a 10-month-old placard campaign that she had started against war was dug out; actors, cricketers and politicians joined both sides of the debate; and a college kid suddenly became the pivot on which the definitions of patriotism and anti-nationalism hinged. What also followed was the most virulent form of internet trolling that included threats of rape and other forms of physical violence, with the 2012 Nirbhaya incident invoked in one case. (A case of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation has been registered.) 
We're not debating the political views of a 20-year-old. Or the possible oversimplifications that her arguments might or might not be suffering from. But by drawing away from the point she was trying to make against the politics of intimidation, and by attacking her national loyalties and accusing her of exploiting her familial ties (her father is a Kargil martyr) in order to validate her views, the internet has once again exposed the feeling of invincibility and bravado that web anonymity affords its users, and the consequent trolls that it spawns. Often, it's harmless, elicits a few laughs, inspires minor/localised outrage, and fades off when ignored. Sometimes it's needed, as in the case of the world vs Donald J Trump. Then there's the other kind, one that indulges in extreme body-shaming, threats, insults and sexual harassment, causing severe mental trauma for the intended target; one needs to grow a rather thick hide to remain unaffected. 
According to a Glamour magazine poll, 57 per cent of the women surveyed reported getting hateful comments on social media. In the feature ‘Stop the Social Savagery', which features the likes of Monica Lewinsky (ambassador of anti-bullying organisation Bystander Revolution) and Mia Matsumiya of @perv_magnet on Instagram, writer Blaire Briody talks about how, while women aren't the only ones targeted online, they are “twice as likely to be harassed on the basis of their gender and three times more likely to get unwanted sexual comments.” And rape has, for long, been one of the top picks among tools used as scare tactics against women. 
So while Kaur may write “Trolls be trolling I be rolling” in a burst of public nonchalance and trophy indifference, there will be a point where the comments will cross the limits of what's permissible and enter into the territory of criminality. Our guardians of patriotism would do well to stamp that out.

Is too late now to say sorry? 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the accounting firm who have been in charge of counting the Oscars ballots for the last 83 years, has apologised for the blunder whereby La La Land was announced as the winner of the Best Picture award, despite it actually going to Moonlight. 
“We sincerely apologise to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,” PwC said in a statement. 
So far, a few more details have emerged of how the whole thing happened, including that there are two sets of the envelopes which contain the winners - leading one to believe Warren Beatty picked up the second envelope meant for the previous award, awarded to Emma Stone for Best Actress. 
Furthermore, information has emerged of the envelope design which changed in 2017, making them potentially harder to read. Critics have suggested this may be the reason why it wasn't noticed when Beatty picked up the wrong envelope. 
Regardless (and don't worry, we'll keep you updated on anything new), the mistake is certainly one which will go down in the history books.

More details emerge, kind of 
It was the mistake seen ‘round the world: La La Land was announced as Best Picture and faster than the award was handed out it was taken away and given to Moonlight, the film that was the real Best Picture winner the entire time. 
Controversy is currently swirling around Hollywood as to what actually happened at the 2017 Oscars. Warren Beatty, the presenter of the award, gave an explanation after the mishap, saying he received the wrong envelope — a fact that ABC News corroborated on Twitter with zoomed-in evidence proving that Beatty was indeed holding the Best Actress envelope when he was on stage. 
Further complicating the matter is Best Actress winner Emma Stone's statements in the post-ceremony media room, where she insisted that she was holding her Best Actress card the entire time. 
Huh? 
Further details on the mix up are sure to emerge overnight. But according to the LA Times, we know that there are in fact two sets of envelopes and winner cards present on the Oscars stage, so it is entirely possible that Beatty got a hold of the wrong card (exactly how that happened remains unanswered) and Stone is telling the truth. 
LAT writer Valli Herman wrote in a 2016 story, “In an undisclosed location, the partners tabulate votes and stuff two sets of winning envelopes, partly as another security measure and also to aid the show's flow. Stationed with their signature briefcases on opposite sides of the stage, either [PricewaterhouseCoopers partners, Brian] Cullinan or [Martha] Ruiz can dispense envelopes to presenters. At the end of the evening, each accountant will have given out about half of the envelopes.” 
The mystery rolls on.

No, it's not Priyanka Chopra 
Actor Priyanka Bose, who starred as Saroo's birth mother in the Australian film Lion, took the Red Carpet Green Dress challenge for the Oscars today, wearing a Vivienne Westwood gown made of recycled materials. 
Bose joined Emma Watson as the 2017 ambassadors for the campaign, run by activist and former actress Suzy Amis Cameron, where leading designers make environmentally conscious gowns to raise awareness of sustainable fashion. 
“It was a dream come true to be able to wear this custom-made Vivienne Westwood gown and the first collection of Atelier Swarovski fine jewellery,” Bose told Vogue. 
“I felt like a queen! To be a part of this campaign that helps improve our environment and gives back is a powerful thing.” 
“I try to live a minimalist lifestyle, but I am constantly learning and Red Carpet Green Dress has taught me that we can all do our part to help.”

Well, this was awkward 
In what will likely go down as one of the most embarrassing moments in Oscars history, the award for Best Picture was awarded to La La Land—but it wasn't the winner of the coveted and prestigious award. Actually, the winner was Moonlight. 
Halfway through speeches from the crew of La La Land, producer Jordan Horowitz announced the real winner was Moonlight. Oscars crew members were seen taking away the statues from La La Land crew, before Horowitz said "Moonlight, you guys won Best Picture. This is not a joke.” 
Warren Beatty, who introduced and presented the award with his 1967 Bonnie and Clyde co-star Faye Dunaway, had initially paused with a look of confusion when announcing the award winner, and Dunaway grabbed the envelope and made the announcement. The actor went on to explain what had happened. 
“I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone La La Land, thats why I said had a long look at Faye and then you,” Beatty said to Kimmel before flashing the incorrect award card towards the camera. 
Awkward? 
Here are some of the best reactions following the gaffe:

Priyanka Chopra and Diana Chopra 
Constantly being on the go can get lonely, but not for Priyanka Chopra. Whether she's in India or the United States, the star always has her army of family and friends close at hand. And her tribe grew by one more last year thanks to her new puppy Diana. 
It was love at first sight for Chopra, who met Diana while shooting a video for Buzzfeed involving dogs. “I've been waiting to get a puppy because my dog is a cocker spaniel, and he's back home in Mumbai with my mom and I really, really miss him. But he's really old, he can't travel now,” she'd said at the time, just hours before she decided to make Diana a part of her life. 
Since then, Diana Chopra hasn't just been accompanying her new mom everywhere, she's got her very own Instagram page too. Her follower count so far: more than 5,000, with just nine posts. Follow her fabulous life of NYC shopping sprees, on-set naps and more through our favourite Insta moments, posted on her and PC's pages.

Winners through the years 
There are few moments that can be considered bigger in a Hollywood actress's career than winning an Oscar - and while we may forget the films for which they won, it's the gowns they wore to collect that all-important statue that often prove most memorable. 
Look back at the style life of Gwyneth Paltrow and you can't help but revisit the powder pink Ralph Lauren gown she wore as she teared up on stage, while Julia Roberts's Valentino dress plucked from the archives is often credited with kick-starting a vintage movement on the red carpet. Audrey Hepburn first stepped out publicly in Givenchy on her Oscar-winning night, marking the start of one of Hollywood's most famous fashion friendships, while Elie Saab became a household name after Halle Berry chose his design for her big moment. 
Some gowns go down in the Oscars fashion history for more dubious reasons - one of the most enduring images from the 2013 Oscars was of Jennifer Lawrence tripping on her voluminous Dior gown as she made her way to the stage, while in the same year Anne Hathaway made headlines for the last-minute dress change that saw her ditch her Valentino design (and promptly upset the design house) for a column dress by Prada.

These celebrity mother-daughter pairs are gorgeous! 
Celebrities step out of the house looking like a million bucks on an everyday basis, with the help of make-up artists and hairstylists, of course. But what has contributed to those stunning no-make-up selfies? Besides healthy lifestyles, their pedigree. While some of them may come from royal families (we're looking at you, Soha Ali Khan), a lot of them look like royalty, regardless. One glance at Soni Razdan and you know Alia Bhatt is going to age gracefully and it's almost obvious where the Hadid sisters get their model faces from. Check out our gallery for some of the prettiest celebrity mother-daughter duos.

Here's why we're crushing on him this week 
The goofy hottie from That '70s Show and Two and a Half Men, Ashton Kutcher is way more than just a very very beautiful face and gorgeous body. This week, we are crushing on him for all he does off screen. 
In 2009, Kutcher established an international human rights organisation with then-wife Demi Moore called The DNA Foundation, which later came to be known as Thorn, which works to address the sexual exploitation of children and the proliferation of child pornography on a global scale. 
In 2013, he teamed up with Evan Beard and Kendall Dabaghi to launch A Plus, a social media-driven content platform focused on upbeat stories. 
Over the weekend, Kutcher started trending for his intense, sentimental speech at the US Senate hearing on child welfare. If you haven't already watched it and swooned, here is your chance:

Weekly Instagram recap: The Bachchans and Karisma Kapoor 
Just when you think India's wedding season is tapering off, a brand new star-studded celebration finds itself splashed all over Instagram. 
This week, the Bachchans headed to Abu Dhabi for a family friend's wedding along with Sridevi (don't miss her daughter Jhanvi Kapoor taking over the dance floor with a friend), while Bipasha Basu, Karan Singh Grover, Katrina Kaif and Sophie Choudry celebrated at Neil Nitin Mukesh's Mumbai reception. 
For others, the last few days brought a chance to enjoy some time off. Karisma Kapoor spent her weekend soaking up some sun by the sea, Alia Bhatt took a break from Badrinath Ki Dulhania promotions to bring in her grandmother's 88th birthday, and mom-to-be Lisa Haydon enjoyed a romantic night out with husband Dino Lalvani.

Pink hearts, chocolate cakes, and countless hugs and kisses: Valentine's Day brings with it a whole lot of feels every year. Whether you're pro mushiness or totally against it, there's really no ignoring the universal day of love, even for the stars. 
Bollywood went all-out on social media this Valentine's Day, embracing every aspect of the occasion. While couples Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover, Shilpa Shetty and Raj Kundra, and Dia Mirza and Sahil Sangha spent their V-Days enjoying each others' company, Jacqueline Fernandez, Sunita Kapoor and Avantika Khan used the day to tell their families how much they appreciate them. 
As for others, this February 14 was a good chance to share new perspectives on love with fans. Don't miss Akshay Kumar's adorable video on women's safety, Varun Dhawan and Disha Patani's group shots with underprivileged kids, and Twinkle Khanna's latest column, now online.

A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Feb 14, 2017 at 11:33pm PST 
While Bollywood's biggest Insta personalities celebrated February 14 with crimson hearts, roses and chocolate, one couple stood out from the crowd for their easy-breezy, effortlessly romantic post dedicated to the occasion. 
Just little over an hour ago, cricket pro Virat Kohli shared this sun-kissed selfie of himself and now confirmed beau Anushka Sharma saying, “Everyday is a Valentine Day if you want it to be. You make everyday seem like one for me” complete with (non-cheesy) black heart emojis and a tag to Sharma's Instagram handle.

This is true love 
“'You know, sometimes the world seems like a pretty mean place.' 'That's why animals are so soft and huggy.'” ― Bill Watterson, Calvin and Hobbes. 
You said it, Billy. 
It's not entirely unusual to find me on the floor at home, wedged between my two dogs, being clobbered with cuteness (and grubby paws and drool)—and after a hard day of work-people-family-work and just being awake, there's no better way to unwind. I haven't always been a dog person, but once I transitioned, the love affair became ceaseless. Whether it's them perceptively picking up on a sad mood and offering a furry shoulder to cry on, or being great listeners (no interruptions when you're ranting, unlike silly hoomans) or just the over-arching selfless love that furballs offer, pets are the purest form of therapy and companionship, I've ever had (and I've never seen a person so excited to see me when I'm home. Butt-dance, anyone?). 
And I'm not alone. The Vogue team might seem more inclined to fur (faux, obviously) on their handbags, but you'd be surprised at the amount of time we spend exchanging dog and cat baby photos (our associate features editor has an Insta account for her two cats)—and sharing tales of chewed up hair straightener wires. So, if you're on the fence about pet parenthood, or like us, believe a pet-person love story is more magical than human ones, read on.

These pictures will have you falling in love with Shweta Bachchan Nanda 
Born to two Bollywood legends, Shweta Bachchan Nanda is a star in her own right. Though she seldom walks the red carpet, the older Bachchan sibling has a way of standing out, be it with the power of her words, or thanks to her impeccable style. 
It is, in fact, her understated elegance that had us at Vogue shooting her for our cover in November 2012. “I don't listen to anyone,” she had told us back then. “I have my own style—my mother will complain, my daughter will complain, but I know what I like. Provocative is for Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj. Elegance lasts so much longer.” And the evidence is in her sartorial purchases. Her very first designer buy was a classic white Prada dress for father Amitabh Bachchan's 50th birthday celebrations. 
All statement silhouettes and vintage waves, Nanda made one stunning subject in our pages, and continues to do so each time she steps out. Want a crash course on acing timeless style? Don't miss these pictures

Could this be the very first solo picture of Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi? 
“Taimur is the most beautiful baby,” new mom Kareena Kapoor Khan proudly told the world a few days ago at Lakmé Fashion Week summer/resort 2017. And just days later, a brand new picture of Bollywood's littlest member has gone viral on social media. 
A clear portrait shot, this image of Taimur Ali Khan isn't the first to stir up the internet, and if rumours are to be believed, this one is not a fake. What makes the world even more confident on its authenticity is the fact that it matches Priyanka Chopra's description to a fault. “It is such a wonderful moment and it is such a beautiful baby,” the star had said when Pataudi was born, “And he already has Kareena's pout.” 
“My son is the most gorgeous man this side of the equator. I take it as a compliment because yes his lips are amazing,” Kapoor Khan responded. “There are a lot of responsibilities on you once you become a mother. You feel that your heart is not beating inside you, but outside your body and that is the biggest responsibility. Both me and Saif always wanted this. We used to talk about all these things. Both of us see ourselves in Taimur and this is the most special thing.” 
Scroll through our slideshow for a recap of some of Taimur's best camera moments so far.

In an interview you’ve got to watch now 
Having sat opposite Ellen Degeneres, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel in the past, Priyanka Chopra is no stranger to international talk shows. But her latest on-screen moment is creating a buzz because it features her taking on the role of interviewer for the first time, chatting with Dev Patel on The View. 
Patel was invited on the show along with Saroo Brierley, the man whose life Lion is based on, and got a chance to chat with Chopra about his career, what it feels like to be nominated for an Oscar, and his Indian roots. “You were born in London, your parents are both immigrants who moved to the UK from Kenya, but you're also Indian. I wanted to understand, what is your connection with India, and shooting in India, where you're from… how was that for you?” Chopra asked the actor. His response is one that will make every Mumbai resident proud. Watch it here.

The star just posted the clearest picture of his little girl yet, posing for the cameras like a natural with mom Mira Rajput. In true Kapoor fashion, the photo comes with a simple, but effective caption.

Hanging out by the sea 
Sunsets with my angel. 
A photo posted by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 6, 2017 at 5:00am PST 
Born in August 2016, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput's daughter, Misha Kapoor, is already a bit of a star. While fans still haven't got a clear look at her, Kapoor does share a glimpse of his toddler every now and then on his Instagram feed. His latest post, however, has surpassed others, as it gives us the clearest view on his daughter so far. 
Weeks after posting an adorable snapshot of Misha's bootie-clad feet, Kapoor just put up this photo of himself enjoying a sunset by the sea with her. In 16 hours, the picture has scored more than 16,000 likes and 800 comments. What makes the moment even sweeter: Kapoor's caption for the picture, “Sunsets with my angel”. Look carefully and you'll notice the finer details of the picture, like Misha's white and pink outfit, and the way she's craning her neck towards the camera for her dad. Looks like this is baby was made for the shutterbugs. 
Mi-shoe ❤️

Meet Lakmé Fashion Week S/R 2017’s Bollywood showstoppers 
From dreamy lehengas to sparkling gowns and sharp pantsuits, Lakmé Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017 had it all. But if you're even a little into Bollywood, you'll agree one of the most exciting aspects of each show is the possibility of a star (or two) sauntering out onto the runway dressed in one of this season's best ensembles. 
The latest season of LFW boasted quite a long list of celebrity showstoppers. While Preity Zinta, Aditi Rao Hydari and Tabu went traditional on the ramp (walking for Sanjukta Dutta, House of Kotwara and Gaurang respectively), Nimrat Kaur went twice as extravagant dressed as a bride for SVA by Sonam and Paras Modi. Bipasha Basu played showstopper for Falguni & Shane Peacock in an intricately embroidered evening gown, and in true LFW tradition, new mom Kareena Kapoor Khan closed the season walking for Anita Dongre's grand finale. Check out our slideshow for the complete list of looks.

Weekly Instagram recap: Katrina Kaif and Twinkle Khanna 
This week was a busy one for most of Bollywood. 
While Aditi Rao Hydari, Vaani Kapoor, Nimrat Kaur, Varun Dhawan and Arjun Kapoor shared their favourite moments from Lakmé Fashion Week summer/resort 2017, Alia Bhatt geared up for the promotions of her next film, Badrinath Ki Dulhania, and Manish Malhotra flew to Delhi to party with Katrina Kaif at Vogue India's winter party for Mario Testino. 
For a few lucky celebrities however, this week brought a chance to enjoy some time off. Twinkle Khanna and Akshay Kumar joined Sussanne Khan and Hrithik Roshan for a staycation at Mumbai's Westin hotel, Priyanka Chopra hit the sea for the weekend, Parineeti Chopra found herself roaming the streets of Lisbon, Shah Rukh Khan visited Amritsar's Golden Temple with son AbRam, and Freida Pinto celebrated her chance to meet the Dalai Lama.

Will you join her? 
Everyone knows Priyanka Chopra for her skills in front of the camera and behind the mic, but many may not aware of her philanthropism. The global icon has been involved with women and children's welfare organisations (including her own, The Priyanka Chopra Foundation for Health and Education) for many years, and has been actively campaigning with UNICEF for over a decade now. Just last year, she was appointed the UNICEF Global Goodwill Ambassador, on the organisation's 70th anniversary. 
Between juggling a career in Bollywood, fulfilling her Hollywood commitments, singing songs in different languages and signing big-ticket campaign deals, Chopra now wants to draw your attention to the “48 million children in the world” who are suffering in conflict zones. 
The link at the end of her video takes you to UNICEF's Humanitarian Action For Children 2017 page which details chilling statistics and evidence for the frightening state of malnutrition children face in places like Nigeria, Yemen, Congo and more. The Syrian refugee crisis alone, according to the website, stands to be one of the worst human tragedies since World War II—which is saying something. Every individual's contribution counts and can help a child in need.

"Diversity is our strength." 
In the second week of his presidency, Donald Trump has instated an executive order blocking all refugees from Syria entering the United States. The order also bans citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from travelling to the US - even if they have an existing visa. 
Since his inauguration on January 20, celebrities have actively campaigned against President Trump, and since the executive order took effect many more have taken to social media to voice their concerns. 
Overnight the hashtag #MuslimBan was trending on Twitter with celebrities tweeting facts (no, not alternative facts) about the order, which charities to donate to and protests to get involved in. 
See them all below.

Here’s what we concurred 
We have been holding our breath for as long as we could manage, but it's time we shared the good news with you—legendary fashion photographer Mario Testino is coming to the country for an exciting project with Vogue India. But we can't spill all the beans just yet. 
A living legend, Testino not only holds an OBE, has lent his artistic vision to several luxury labels, but his body work of work is one of the most cherished in the Condé Nast family. The Peruvian photographer has held several exhibitions and authored many photography books, each one a visual treasure. Now that he is coming to town, we can't wait to meet him, but until then here's an insider view on his life via Instagram. 
His sense of humor is on point.

Did you spot her at the Mumbai airport? 
From Suits star to 2016's most Googled actor and Prince Harry's beau, Meghan Markle juggles many hats. But you may not know that the TV actor is also actively involved with charity organisation World Vision Canada. 
It is, in fact, Markle's association with WVC (she is an ambassador for the international Christian charity, just like Lady Diana was) that had her fly to Delhi this week for five days to talk about young women's health and hygiene. She also got the chance to take part in meetings with several NGOs during her trip, and chatted with Shamina Shafiq, a former member of the National Commission for Women. 
The star was also spotted days ago at the Mumbai airport, casually clad in black skinny jeans and a tee. But what's really caused a stir amongst Markle's fans is the mehendi tattoo spotted on her right hand, which she is rumoured to have had painted on while meeting young girls in India. Take a closer look above.

Shaking a leg on international television 
Even after the release of her first Hollywood film, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Deepika Padukone seems unstoppable. First appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and now The Late Late Show with James Corden, the actor is putting Bollywood (and this particular dance from one of her movies) on the global map. 
After getting Vin Diesel to sway to the popular Chennai Express number 'Lungi Dance' while promoting her Hollywood film in India, the leggy star recently taught host James Corden the moves on his talk show. Using jackets wrapped around their waists as lungis, they seemed to have a blast nailing all the Bollywood dance steps. 
Watch the video to see Padukone dance to the Chennai Express number with James Corden as Diesel cheers them on.

The funniest memes on Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration

Donald Trump's First Ladies 
As America prepares for the inauguration of its 45th president, Donald Trump, much speculation still surrounds what role two of the most important women in his life will have. His daughter, Ivanka, who has already moved to Washington following the election, is set to become perhaps the most involved first daughter of all time, while Trump's wife Melania will not be living in the White House when his term begins. 
Melania plans to stay at the family's New York apartment within Trump Tower in order that their son, Barron, will not be uprooted or removed from school during the term – and although many assume that she will then head to Washington, probably in the summer, she could remained based in New York if she wished. Although Michelle Obama has carved a role as a philanthropic and campaigning first lady, there is no minimum involvement required for the role other than to act as a co-host for events within the White House, which Melania could do without living there. 
Even with the inauguration less than 24 hours away, Ivanka Trump's role has still not been confirmed, leading many to surmise that no official role will be given to the first daughter. A source told Us Weekly that it is likely that she will be “Donald's closest adviser. He looks to Ivanka for advice and consultation on almost everything.” The source added that Ivanka's personality is a useful foil for Trump's famously confrontational temperament. “She balances him out. She learned to keep her mouth shut and just let him get it off his chest. She then rationally explains other points of view.” 
While Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, has been given an official role as an adviser in Trump's team, many Capitol Hill blogs are speculating that the country's anti-nepotism laws would make it difficult for Trump to hire Ivanka officially. The 1967 Federal Anti-Nepotism Statute decrees that an executive agency official is not permitted to appoint relatives to “a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control”, Constitution Daily states – although the law does not directly reference the White House. Questions arose over President Clinton's appointment of wife Hillary to lead a health-care task force, but the administration argued at the time that the first lady was not a “government employee”. 
If Ivanka did assume first lady duties, at least for the first few months of Trump's presidency, she would not be the first to take on the role without being the president's wife – although generally another family member is only selected if the president is a bachelor or a widower. Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha was his first lady; Martin Van Buren enlisted his daughter-in-law; and James Buchanan was accompanied by his niece – reportedly the first person to use the moniker “first lady”. 
While many will focus on only their wardrobes, it now appears that Trump's two first lady candidates could rewrite the role from within.

The actor gets candid on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' 
Deepika Padukone has been on the promotional rounds for her upcoming feature xXx: Return of Xander Cage and was a guest on the primetime favourite—The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Padukone and host DeGeneres chatted about the actor's humble beginnings and badminton, segueing into her chemistry with co-star, Vin Diesel. 
The actor, who plays knife-wielding huntress Serena Unger in her latest feature, admitted to her crush on Diesel and how she has imagined having “amazing babies” with him, but went on to say that all of this was just in “her head”, eliciting laughter from the audience. Back home, Diesel recently referred to Ranveer Singh as Padukone's boyfriend at a press conference—finally giving the speculators of that match some (but still unofficial) closure. The talk show will air on TV later today'; till then, here's a teaser for you.

If you're the sort of person who checks labels for words and phrases like “no animal testing”, “Rainforest-Alliance”, “GMO-free” and “cruelty-free”, Bourgeois Boheme is definitely becoming part of your must-shop-from list. Think British classics and everyday utilitarian pieces—brogues, derbys and Chelsea boots alongside tributes to all-time shoe favourites Stan Smiths and Vans—in a dark autumnal colour palette and subtle contemporary detailing, completely free from animal-derived materials, ethically produced in Portugal from eco-friendly Italian vegan leathers. These feel-good shoes are as chic as they are conscious.

Post on your SO’s wall 
Ryan Gosling's speech at the Golden Globes probably hit you in the feels—the actor attributed his win for the best actor in a musical or a comedy to his partner Eva Mendes. The La La Land actor and Mendes are notoriously private about their relationship but Gosling broke his silence to give credit where it was due. After thanking his co-star and director and the ‘mountain of people' who helped him get there, he thanked the one person whose support was crucial to his performance. 
“While I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one the best experiences I've ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer,” said Gosling. “If she hadn't taken all that on so that I could have this experience, would surely be someone else up here other than me to today. Sweetheart, thank you,” and dedicated the award to the late Carlos Mendez. 
This however is not the first time our hearts melted on account of Gosling's mindfulness. The subject of many memes, he made a special video for the late filmmaker Ryan McHenry, who created the ‘Ryan Gosling Won't Eat His Cereal' meme. In the video he raises his spoonful of cereal to McHenry and proceeds to eat it. 
He became the Internet's boyfriend when Danielle Henderson, a teacher of the Gender Studies program in the University of Wisconsin started a tumblr blog of feminist Ryan Gosling memes, which are all available as a book. The “Hey Girl” movement may have started as a joke but it's great to know that the face of tumblr feminism is living up to his legacy in real life.

It’s official: Lisa Haydon is pregnant! 
Close to three months ago, Lisa Haydon tied the knot with longtime beau Dino Lalwani with a beach wedding in Phuket. Since then, the newlyweds have been enjoying their time together scuba diving and sunbathing in Australia with family and friends, giving us major vacation envy with their Insta pictures. 
But nothing on Haydon's social media feed compares to the picture she posted just minutes ago, clad in a bikini and showing off a little baby bump. It's safe to say that she may just be the fittest mom-to-be you'll see for a while (did you miss her on our January issue's cover?). 
While there's no confirmation on how far along Haydon is already, we can't wait to watch her pregnancy progress, and wish the couple the very best. Scroll through our slideshow for a look back at their sweetest wedding pictures.

Macy's – the American department store chain – has begun 2017 with the announcement that it plans to close 68 stores and cut more than 10,000 jobs. The restructure, announced via a press release, is set to save the company an estimated $550 million a year – some of which will be invested in growing the digital business, the company confirmed. 
“As we've noted, it is essential that we maintain a healthy portfolio of the right stores in the right places,” Terry J Lundgren, chairman and chief executive officer of Macy's, said. “Our plan to close approximately 100 stores over the next few years is an important part of our strategy to help us right-size our physical footprint as we expand our digital reach. We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetising locations with highly valued real estate. These are never easy decisions, and we are committed to treating associates affected by these closings with respect and transparency.” 
Of the 68 stores, three have already shuttered during 2016, 63 will be closed in early spring 2017, and two will be closed in mid-2017. Three other locations were sold, or are to be sold, and are being leased back, the press release detailed. 
Macy's is not alone in taking action to combat challenging retail circumstances. Several other American household names are in strife: JC Penney has closed 80 locations since 2014, Racked reports, while Sears has closed nearly 300.

Last night, the most loved personalities of Hollywood (and Bollywood icon Priyanka Chopra) came together to celebrate the best performances of the year at the 2017 edition of the Golden Globe Awards. 
While most of the world gushed over the extravagant ensembles of the women on the red carpet, another major talking point from the evening was actor Meryl Streep's speech. 
As the last high-profile Hollywood event before Donald Trump takes his seat as president of the United States, The Golden Globes gave Streep a platform to voice her opinion on the new leader. 
“There was one performance this year that stunned me — it sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good; there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter,” said Streep, referring to a speech made by Trump in 2015 were he was reported to have mocked a journalist of The New York Times. “It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can't get it out of my head, because it wasn't in a movie. It was real life. 
“This instinct to humiliate, when it's modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody's life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” said the star. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” 
The response to Streep's speech at the event was strong, and her words have since taken over the internet, receiving both, positive and negative reactions. 
As for Priyanka Chopra, who attended and presented at the event, there was nothing but love for Streep. Their adorable backstage picture together says it all.

One wedding, countless vacations and more 
A lot has changed in Bipasha Basu's life between the present and her last birthday. 
The star turned 37 back in 2016 with a beachey getaway in the Maldives, and her year only got better with time. Basu tied the knot with longtime beau Karan Singh Grover in one of Bollywood's most talked about weddings in April, then jetsetted to Spain with him for a mid-year break. 
That's not where the excitement ends! The actor also celebrated her very first Karva Chauth last year, and set a whole new standard of #FitnessGoals with her feature in Vogue's December 2016 issue. Add to that a handful of adorable family photos, envy-worthy beauty looks and FOMO-inducing party pictures, and you've got an album worth scrolling through repeatedly. Keep up with the icon via her coolest Instagrams over last year.

Get with it 
If getting back from your holiday (to a hundred unread emails) and settling back into your routine has made you miss out on all the great online reads this week, here's the Vogue team's lowdown. 
“This story made me rethink the meaning of selfish. Because if you can't be at peace with yourself first, or happy with where you are in life—is there scope to spread happiness or be a kind person? I don't think so,” says senior copy editor Chandni Sehgal. 
“A recent study claims that your colleagues' offerings of birthday cake and other sugary treats is leading to widespread obesity and tooth decay. If you too have been a victim to the menace of free macarons and warm Nutella-and-sea-salt cookies at your workplace, this article offers practical means of redressal,” says assistant editor - Vogue.in, Ridhima Sapre. 
“Move over hygge, 2017 is about lagom—the Swedish concept of ‘not too much, not too little','' says fashion features writer, Neharika Manjani. 
“I've read, and re-read this piece all week. Mostly because it's like looking into a mirror, this is my life. And I'm sure it will ring true for most women. A full day of hard work and when we are back home, a second shift awaits us. Where is the downtime? The story makes me wish I was a man,” says beauty editor, Nidhi Sharma Punjabi. 
“The return of the cute boys is a serious concern. Thank God for this one,” says junior beauty editor, Sneha Mankani. 
“A convincing read about how this popular television series gave birth to the republic of dunces as we see in the post-Trump world today,” associate features editor, Megha Mahindru. 
“How funny is this? Media's favourite millennial is only 55 years old,” says features director, Anindita Ghose. 
“In case you don't already know, Donald Trump is going to meet with Graydon Carter and the top editors and digital editors of all Condé Nast publications,” says digital writer, Raveena Shahpuri.

"Those women in Bengaluru will have memories for life" 
One more New Year's, one more episode of sexual assault, a few men shaming the victims. I'm appalled, like any woman would be. Hardly shocked, just like the rest of us aren't. We're a nation of women who've conditioned themselves to develop thick skins. React, but only when you have to. Feign deafness if that's an option. Avoid that place, if you can. Going out? Great. How and when are you getting home, though? No one's eliminating the threat, so we'll just go around it. Whenever there's a horrible and widely-reported incident, we dust our memories, both distant and recent, to talk about how we feel about it, what we've gone through, what we're all going through (I'm doing that now). 
We remember. That time, when as a 12-year-old, while sleeping on the upper berth of a train from Delhi to Kharagpur, three boys jump to where you're sleeping and start fondling your thighs in the middle of the night, and the best way you manage to describe it is, “Those boys were pulling my legs,” because you didn't know any better. That time when, at ten in the morning, right in the middle of the heavily fortified Parliament Street in Delhi, a man passing you on his bicycle waits till he gets close to you before he whispers “r**di”. The three boys at the train station who wait till you cross them, before they start following you and being lewd. The many who see that but pretend not to. Earphones aren't just for listening. They're also for not hearing what you don't want to. 
I moved to Mumbai from Delhi three years, and it was refreshing—the fact that I could walk out of a place and hail a kaali-peeli at two in the night, and not haggle over fares. That I didn't have to ask my mom to drive me to the Huda City Centre metro station because I was wearing a dress. Then, very soon, while walking down the foot over-bridge that connects Bandra station to Hill Road, it came. Some comment about my underwear that I'm embarrassed to repeat. It never ends. 
Facing obnoxious behaviour affects you, painting innocent things and people with malicious intent. So the sound of an approaching bike still takes me back to my years in college in Cuttack in Odisha (then Orissa), where every afternoon, after class, someone from my hostel floor would come in crying about her breasts being pinched by a perv on a bike. Other days someone got a detailed report on the shape, size and appeal (or the lack thereof) of her anatomy. They were a daily occurrence, so we did what we could: Avoid going out between two and four in the afternoon when the campus got deserted (if you did, go in a group; there's an illusion of safety in numbers); fidget with our bag straps if you heard a motorbike approached; carry safety pins to movie halls to poke straying hands in case the lights were switched off before you found your seat. We complained to the warden about the campus harassment, but nothing came of it. If one guy from the boys' hostel—the quiet, mouse-like creature who didn't look up his desk in class—took a fancy to you, you'd hear shouts of “bhaujo” (“sister-in-law” in Oriya) from every window of the boy's hostel that you inevitable had to pass on your way to class (so, the next four years). There was a lot of strength in solidarity there. 
Holi was a surreal enactment of Quixotic proportions. Our campus comprised four boys' hostels and one women's. So every year we'd have cops stationed outside and within our hostel. Visitors were barred, and we couldn't go out, even if you had to buy a pack of sanitary napkins or photocopy notes. We. The boys would take out a procession and halt outside our boundary wall for some energetic pelvic thrusts and bottle-throwing. We'd shut our windows, climb up our desks, with our plates of Maggi cooked with immersion rods, and peep through the skylights to look at these strange drunken creatures in green and red who somehow couldn't find another venue, while the cops at the gate sipped their tea and looked on. Oh, but boys will be boys. 
All this didn't constitute every minute of every day of my life there. We, at the women's hostel, suspicious of most, fell into each other—travelling ticketless to Puri after jumping a wall to take the shortcut to the station, watching every movie that released in theatres (those were the years of Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai and Mohabbatein with the occasional Monsoon Wedding thrown in), queuing up outside phone booths, making friends for life. So I remember the good things, too. The bad things, though, always stick more tenaciously. Those women in Bengaluru will have memories for life. But if it's any consolation (it isn't) we all will, and we won't forget.

In light of Bengaluru’s horrific molestation case 
Days ago, news about yet another Indian woman being molested, this time in the streets of Bengaluru on New Year's Eve, broke out. The incident has set Indian newsfeeds ablaze, with people across the country spotlighting the changes that need to be made and sharing their own experiences with rape and molestation. One among the millions to voice their opinion yesterday was Malaika Arora Khan, who just took to Instagram with the following message. 
So, I went out with my girlfriends to party on the crowded streets of a Metropolitan city, they came out in large numbers and molested us...... But my safety is my responsibility so... The next time I went to a discotheque, it was enclosed and had bouncers, they came into the place and beat us up and ripped our clothes off.......But my safety is my responsibility so.... I went to a movie with a Male friend for company, they pushed me into a bus and shoved an iron rod inside my privates.......But my safety is my responsibility, so...... I went to my college, fully clad in a "decent" salwaar kameez, they caught me around a corner and squeezed my bum......But my safety is my responsibility, so...... I decided to stay at home in the comfort of my own house, they broke down the door, tied me up and videotaped the things they made me do with them.......But my safety is my responsibility, so...... I went back to live with my family feeling safe and secure with them, they were my uncles but they didn't think of me as their niece when they made me take off my clothes and have their way with me.......But my safety is my responsibility, so....... These days I sit in the bathroom, locked tight, not coming out at all. They stand on the terrace opposite to it peeking in through the bathroom window, but I don't take a bath.......because my safety is my responsibility....... Now, they have me exactly where they have always wanted me, my spirit broken, my ability to fight back gone, my will to do something destroyed.....at their mercy.....still stuck in the bathroom.....dreading the time when the knocking starts on the door as they come to get me here too. 
I am that Indian Woman who can excel at sports, win medals for the Country, join the Army, become a CEO, go to the outer space and be the talk of the world.....only if I can come out of this bathroom......But my safety is my responsibility, so.... Disclaimer: Girls wearing short clothes and drinking and partying are copying the Western culture.Boys who molest them r copying the Indian culture??? 
The post has collected more than 23,000 likes and 1,000 comments in about 24 hours, and is continuing to grab attention. 
Khan isn't the only star to have inspired fans with her strong opinion over the last few days. Here's a look at what some other icons of the country have said recently. Follow the hashtags #YesAllWomen and #IWillGoOut for more.

Bollywood royalty through the years 
Since her debut in Om Shanti Om back in 2007, Deepika Padukone has grown into one of India's biggest icons, and is now all set to take over Hollywood too. 
Looking back, the star has come a long way in just a decade. From romantic classics like Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Love Aaj Kal and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela to action-heavy films including Chandni Chowk to China, Padukone has done it all. 
Her upcoming projects sound just as exciting: in the next year, you will see her in an all new avatar for Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi's next project, play badass Serena in xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, and transform into the queen of Chittor in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati. Until we wait for Padukone to hit the silver screen, here's a look at her best movie moments so far.

Weekly Instagram recap: Sridevi and Bipasha Basu 
The last week was as busy as could be for the stars. 
Priyanka Chopra touched down in Mumbai and was welcomed by a grand party thrown by Manish Malhotra (we spotted Neha Dhupia, Sophie Choudry and Sushant Singh Rajput there too), and Akshay Kumar brought in wife Twinkle Khanna's birthday with a lunch that included the birthday girl's favourite people. Athiya Shetty used a sweet throwback picture to celebrate her brother Ayan's birthday, while Sridevi shared a flashback shot of daughter Jhanvi Kapoor, and Rhea Kapoor picked an old family photo for her father Anil Kapoor's 60th birthday. 
Other stars spent their time off in different countries before heading home for the new year. Both Nargis Fakhri and Karisma Kapoor enjoyed some beach time (the former in Belize, the latter in Thailand), Bipasha Basu headed off to Australia with husband Karan Singh Grover, and Parineeti Chopra rode an ATV up a volcano on her adventurous getaway. Want more unmissable posts? Check out Priyanka Chopra flawless mannequin challenge video here.

Kareena Kapoor Khan’s first post-baby dinner date looks super sweet 
New mom Kareena Kapoor Khan powered through her much-discussed pregnancy without any maternity break, so it comes as no surprise that the star has bounced back after her delivery in mere days. Barely a week since the birth of their first son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, the star couple headed out for a quick dinner date in one of Bollywood's favourite Bandra hangouts, Olive Bar and Restaurant. Khan picked a laid-back terracotta-hued number for the evening. Other stars we spotted dining out at the same place: Dia Mirza and Konkona Sen Sharma. This isn't the first (or fifth, or tenth) time Khan has given expecting and new moms major style goals. Check out some of her best maternity looks here.

After several on-agains and off-agains, months of rumours and speculation, a fresh new rumour about cricket's favourite couple has now taken over the Internet. Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli may just get engaged this New Year's eve in Dehradun, where they could be joined by friends including the Ambanis and Amitabh Bachchan. However, Kohli was quick to take to Twitter to dismiss the rumours. 
" we aren't getting engaged & if we were going to,we wouldn't hide it. Simple... (1/2) 
— Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) December 30, 2016 
(2/2)Since news channels cant resist selling false rumours & keeping you confused, we are just ending the confusion :) 
— Virat Kohli (@imVkohli) December 30, 2016 
Incase you missed it, here's a sunny video of the star enjoying some quiet time off in Ananda in the Himalayas. 
In the end, It's all about cherishing the simple things in life 😇❤️#nature

The couple were also recently spotted together at Yuvraj Singh and Hazel Keech's Goa wedding. Our favourite #Virushka moment, however, will always be their first time on the red carpet at Vogue's Beauty Awards. Check it out here.

Bollywood had a blast this weekend 
It's that time of year again! Bollywood pulled on its party shoes this weekend to bring in Christmas and spend time with family and friends.

These pictures of Deepika Padukone will give you crazy #FitnessGoals 
From Vanity Fair to Paper magazine, Deepika Padukone is no longer a stranger to the pages of international publications. And as 2017 comes ever closer, the star shares a sneak peek at her next shoot, this time for the upcoming issue of health and fitness magazine Self. 
The concept of the sports-inspired shoot (you'll see Padukone transform herself into a ballerina on one frame, a swimming champ in the next, and a kick boxer in the third) couldn't be more perfect for the star, for whom being active has always been a natural part of life. Make sure you read the captions that accompany each picture too: they include little quotes from Padukone that give you little insights into her acting process, and how working out impacts her life. 
If you needed a sign to get fit this 2017, this is it.

See how the stars are wishing the new parents 
Kareena Kapoor Khan and husband Saif Ali Khan welcomed their first child together, a boy named Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, early morning on December 20. 
Just as the news hit the internet, the new mom's sister, Karisma Kapoor shared her excitement on her Instagram page with the sweetest congratulatory post for the occasion. But that's not all. In his first few hours Bollywood's little Pataudi has already taken many other accounts by storm.

Could this be the very first Khan family portrait? 
While the world continues to debate over the authenticity of the Instagram picture featuring Kareena Kapoor Khan and her son, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi (which hit the internet yesterday), here's a look at an adorable snapshot of the Khans with their first child shared just minutes ago by close friend and celebrity trainer Yasmin Karachiwala.

Taken at Breach Candy hospital, this snapshot is the first official Khan family portrait. It's hard to pick what's cuter: the smile on the new mother's face as Saif Ali Khan leans in for a kiss, or the uncanny resemblance between the newborn and his parents.

Here’s what we know so far 
After what may be Bollywood's most talked-about pregnancy recently (we've been fangirling on her maternity style for weeks now), Kareena Kapoor Khan and husband Saif Ali Khan welcomed their first baby, a little boy, early morning on December 20. Here's the couple's official statement. 
"We are very pleased to share with you all the wonderful news about the birth of our son: Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, on the 20th of December 2016. We would like to thank the media for the understanding and support they have given us over the last 9 months, and of course especially our fans and well wishers for their continued affection. Merry Christmas and a happy new year to you all… With love, Saif & Kareena" 
It's safe to say the entire Khan and Kapoor clan is ecstatic about its new member. Both mother and baby are in good health. Looking at his parents' genes, we can pretty much guarantee this baby has won the life lottery. 
Here's a look at the new mom's best style moments through her pregnancy.

Looks like it 
A photo posted by Friday Pop (@fridaypop) on Dec 15, 2016 at 12:48pm PST 
Ever since news broke (on the Victoria's Secret runway, none the less) that Irina Shayk and Bradley Cooper were having a baby, engagement rumours have been flying all over the place. 
Now, Shayk has been spotted wearing what looks to be an engagement ring while walking into a nail salon in Los Angeles, adding fuel to the fire. Despite her new season Chanel boots and ever-growing baby bump, all eyes were on that ring finger, where a shiny emerald ring surrounded by diamonds sat — an engagement ring fit for a Victoria's Secret model if we ever saw one. 
The pair are yet to reveal if rumours are true, but by the looks of these pictures, it seems there might be a Mini Cooper and a marriage to match. 
And what do you do when you've got a shiny new ring? Get a manicure, of course.

These spunky Indian women made it to Google’s most searched list 
If anyone could win a badge of honour for winning 2016 that would be Priyanka Chopra. After her success with Quantico, Baywatch, winning the Padma Shri, hanging out with Jimmy Fallon and Ellen DeGeneres, the actor is now making headlines for being one of the most Googled names this year. 
Joining Chopra's top rank is none other than designer Anita Dongre who made international news when Kate Middleton wore a dress by her during the Royal visit to India. Disha Patani was the most sought-after Bollywood star. Google's most searched list also includes powerhouse women like Beyoncé, Zaha Hadid, Simone Biles and Hillary Clinton. 
So delighted that my Oscar outfit featured in @Google's #YearInSearch! Thank you for the love! #ZuhairMurad Google.com/2016

Confirmed 
Google has released its annual data of the most searched terms of the year, and Meghan Markle has come out on top for most Googled actress of 2016. The data pulled by Googled shows what people are most curious about. 
Suits actress Markle began dating Prince Harry in late October, which is when we expect the curiosity about her may have peaked. So it's quite a feat considering Markle has had only two months to beat out the likes of Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence and Alicia Vikander. The most Googled actor? Brad Pitt.

Falguni and Shane Peacock open their sea-facing store in Goa 
Husband and wife duo Falguni and Shane More of their label Falguni and Shane Peacock have had a 2016 inundated with achievements—the label has dressed the likes of Gwen Stefani, Beyoncé and Taraji P. Henson in this year alone. A party, one in the Morjim-Ashvem stretch of Goa is as good as excuse as any, to take the edge off things and launch their resort wear outpost. 
The designers flew down a contingent of press, models and friends of the brand, to stage a fashion show at the popular ‘White Party' at the Marbela Beach Resort. With much reluctance from the revelers, the dance floor was divided to make way for a runway. The resort collection featured their signature prints on kaftans, bikinis, flowing skirts and even venturing into the destination wedding space with lehengas. 
The resort wear outpost (neighboring Shivan & Narresh's store) is located at the resort at the Marbela. “Goa is the most visited beach destination in India. It fits in perfectly for our luxury beach and resort wear collection as it attracts buyers from all over the globe,” said Falguni about the choice of location for the store. 
“What is exciting for the Falguni Shane Peacock Label is longevity and continued freshness of a nautical look,” added Shane Peacock.

Want some inspiration? Read this 
Santa: What do you want for Christmas? Me: A dragon. Santa: Be realistic. Me: Ok, a boyfriend. Santa: What colour Dragon do you want? 
Image: Arsh Sayed 
We've all seen the meme ridiculing unrealistic Christmas demands – and while it's pretty funny, us here at team Vogue, think about what we'd put on our own fantasy wish list. From a heart attack to the US president elect to a blizzard in Mumbai, our team got pretty inventive – and to keep it real, we threw in our ‘affordable' demands, too. Here's some serious insouciant inspiration. 
Priya Tanna, editor-in-chief Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): Eternal happiness and contentment. Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): A trip to Japan with my family. 
Divya Jagwani, bookings editor Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): Trump getting a cardiac arrest or I could settle for a scuba diving trip Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): A new Fitbit! 
Srushti Hebbar, graphic designer Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): A time machine so I can Marty McFly-it and cancel all the terrible things that happened in 2016 – and fast-forward to a brand new 2017. Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): A cute polaroid camera – peach! 
Shalini Shah, copy chief Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): A three-day working week (for always) – or unlimited air miles Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): Black DocMartens 
Priyanka Khanna, associate fashion features director Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): Six months off to sleep, travel, spend time with my child, and finally, write that book! (I hope my boss is reading this!) Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): A vintage gold charm bracelet. I can never have enough! 
Ankita Chandra, associate photo editor Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): I hope that it starts snowing in Bombay on Christmas Eve and the vada pav vendors start selling mulled wine and churros with Nutella. All night long. Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): To get out of the city and go someplace beautiful for New Year's Eve. Oh, I'd like to have a cottage in the forest or by the sea. I'm pretty conventional that way. 
Neharika Manjani, fashion features writer Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): A day with the Gilmore Girls cast Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): Gucci fur slides 
Chandni Sehgal, copy editor Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): Clichéd, and Buddha will probably say that happiness isn't a destination, but a journey – but I'd really like for this season to be full of love and genuine kindness. Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): Hiding away in the hills to usher in the new year. Any hill station will do, I'm not entirely picky when it comes to running away from the city. 
Anindita Ghose, features director Wishing upon a star (Fantasy): My Christmas fantasy is my Netflix homepage smiling back at me with a “watch now” button below the mini-series (Italian with English subtitles, please) of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels. This should be directed by Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso, Malena). Wishing on someone's wallet (Reality): The French perfumer Gérald Ghislain believes “opera, like perfume, glorifies women.” His range of five perfumes inspired by operatic divas is seductive. I just ordered the Eau de Parfum of the 1875 (Carmen!) but I believe I deserve all five because I'm every woman, et cetera. Thank you, Santa. Here's a helpful link:com

The star is now the organisation’s global Goodwill Ambassador 
A global icon today, Priyanka Chopra never hesitates to help make the world a better place. Cases in point: her appearance at Michael Kors' 10th annual Global Hearts Awards dinner earlier this year, her active promotion of adopting rescue puppies, and her constant efforts to encourage people to help educate underprivileged kids. 
As of yesterday, Chopra has also joined the UNICEF family as its newest global Goodwill Ambassador. The announcement was made by David Beckham and 12-year-old actor Millie Bobby Brown at a celebration last night commemorating 70 years of the children's agency. 
It's safe to say Chopra couldn't be prouder, especially since her association with UNICEF is older than most know. "Along this decade old journey, with UNICEF, I have been on many field trips to villages and centres across India. On those trips, I spent time with numerous young girls and their families and experienced firsthand the transformative power of empowering young girls with opportunities that are rightfully theirs. Together, with my fellow, dedicated ambassadors, I am now proud to stand with UNICEF to help build a world where children's rights are respected and protected," the star stated amongst UN diplomats, other UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors and the guests. "My wish for children is freedom. The freedom to think, the freedom to live. I, we ask you to join us today to become the collective voice of the oppressed children across the world in our fight against injustices that they have to endure everyday. Let's choose humanity, let's choose to act now, let's choose to fight now and let's choose to ensure a better world for our children, their children and the generations to come." 
The evening was also attended by Orlando Bloom and Jackie Chan. See the best moments here. 
Honored to continue the amazing work we've accomplished in India and take that commitment to those in need across the world as @UNICEF's Global Goodwill Ambassador... On their 70th anniversary tonight, I look forward to working with my fellow advocates to drive change in mindsets and ensure that we build a world where children's rights are respected and protected, and that there is a voice, #foreverychild

“I love my baby Adira…Can’t live or breathe without her” 
Rani Mukerji is one of the most celebrated actors in the film industry and also a doting mother. On her daughter, Adira's first birthday, she has penned an emotional letter that speaks to mothers and daughters everywhere. 
Apart from expressing her love and warm wishes for her daughter, she also spoke about the fears and anxieties that come along with motherhood. The heartfelt letter below is the most relatable thing you will read today. 
‘I love my baby Adira… Can't live or breathe without her… My life has changed… But for the better.. But having a baby is so scary.. Because you suddenly stop living for yourself.. You live for your child.. As she has given birth to you.. A mother! I can't sleep at night.. I can't get sleep in the day.. I often think about all the zillion mothers who have given birth.. Do they all go through the same anxiety.. Or is it only me?? I salute all mother! I am eternally grateful to the Almity to have given me this blessing in the form of Adira! I don't know if anyone understands me at this point of my life.. But I'm going with the flow.. I let anyone and everyone say things to me without me reacting.. sometimes reacting also.. I've become much calmer.. More patient.. And more forgiving.. It happened overnight one day suddenly.. I realized I have changed.. Again for the better I guess. I hope I can bring up Adira beautifully.. Without any fears.. Brave.. Wise.. Clever.. Disciplined.. Well mannered.. I want everyone to be proud of her.. Even if nobody is I will always be proud of her.. Encourage her to follow her heart.. Not get bullied ever.. not be pressurized for anything in life.. Be carefree always.. Happy and smiling.. Laughing wholeheartedly.. Her smile reaching her eyes..' - Rani Mukherji Chopra

Travel junkies, Dia Mirza’s photo album is going to inspire you for life 
When it comes to travelling, few have the kind of stamina Dia Mirza does. And what makes her adventures twice as exciting is the fact that she's always posting about them on social media. 
This year alone, Mirza has found herself partying away in Bali for a friend's wedding, becoming one with nature by the banks of the Ganga, feeding baby elephants in Assam, and catching some sunshine between Madrid and Barcelona. 
And her travels last year were no less exciting. Don't miss the pictures of her hanging out with tigers on a trek, spending quality time with husband Sahil Sangha on a cruise in the Maldives, and getting her nature fix amidst the gardens of Kashmir. It's enough to inspire you to book your next vacation tonight!

“Of course I will.” 
In the weeks following the election, designers have spoken out for or against dressing the First Lady-elect Melania Trump. 
Now fashion designer Carolina Herrera has joined the affirmative team, saying it would be an honour to dress the future First Lady.Speaking at a New York event to celebrate the designer and her brand, Herrera was asked about whether she would dress Melania Trump. 
“Of course I will, as the first lady of this country I will. Of course.” 
“It is an honour to dress the first ladies of the country and it's something to do for the United States. It's not for myself. It's for the public.” 
Between Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera, we think the future First Lady is sartorially sorted.

When Prince Harry released that statement confirming his relationship with Suits actress Meghan Markle, we knew for sure they were dating. But now they have confirmed that it is in fact true love. 
Meghan Markle has been spotted wearing a personalised necklace with the letters M and H on it. Presumably gifted to her by Prince Harry, the necklace is definitely making a statement that things are super official now. 
The 14-karat gold necklace is by Los Angeles jewellery designer Maya Brenner. The Assymmetrical Letter and Charm necklace retails for USD$240 for one letter, with each additional letter or charm (eg. A love heart) costing USD$60. That means that yes, Prince Harry has gone out of his way to pop both their initials on the necklace.

These pictures take you straight into Vaani Kapoor’s world 
From Bollywood newbie in 2013 to scoring the lead in Yash Raj Film's coolest new flick, Vaani Kapoor has come a long way in three short years. But how much do you really know about the star? 
A quick scroll through Kapoor's Insta feed reveals a lot about her. For one, she loves taking selfies with Bollywood buddies Shanoo Sharma and Bhumi Pednekar. Number two: Be it cats, cows or horses, Kapoor adores animals (case in point: her picture captioned “We should always feed the cow… Not eat them”). And lastly, Kapoor is in the midst of a love affair with the city of Paris. Check out her dreamy travel pictures before you get set to watch Befikre!

She stressed on very important points 
For a Bollywood A-lister, Katrina Kaif chooses to stay out of the limelight for anything that's not directly related to her work. She has always remained tight-lipped about her personal life and up until very recently, also chose to stay off social media. 
But when it comes to women's rights, Kaif is not one to mince her words. At the recent 'WeUnite' conference, which marks UN Women's partnership with the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kaif spoke out against martial rape. 
"I know of educated women, who remain silent in the face of violence, because they are afraid to confront societal norms and have fingers pointed in their direction. Especially when the majority of our society fails to recognise martial rape as a crime," said Kaif. According to the law, marital rape is only recognised if the victim is between 12-16 years of age. 
"I would urge more women to speak up. It is not okay to feel inferior or weak, because we are not the weaker sex by any stretch of imagination. On a daily basis there are shocking stories about the violent crimes made against women. Yet, I can only imagine how many other crimes against women in India go unreported," said the actor. 
Kaif concluded by bringing to focus the increase in the number of crimes against women in the last decade. "However I would like to believe that this increase in numbers is not an increase in crime against women. It is in increase in number of women who are ready to come forward and reporting them," she said.

Manish Malhotra’s coolest Instagram moments from 2016 
He's spent so many years styling the stars and spinning together dreamy wedding ensembles that it's no wonder Manish Malhotra is amongst the Bollywood crew's favourite designers. 
Last year, the couturier brought in his birthday with his very own Vogue India cover (and a cake to go with it). And just as we expected, 2016 has been one of his most envy-worthy years yet. Scroll through his Instagram feed and you'll see all the cool activities he's been up to. Our favourite moments: When both Urmila Matondkar and Preity Zinta picked his designs for their weddings, the time when Karolina Kurkova and Donna Karan partied away at his breathtaking home, and of course, catching his creations in the theatre version of Mughal-e-Azam.

After a grand cocktail that was attended by the cricketer's fellow team mates—Virat Kohli, Parthiv Patel, Mohammed Shami, Ajinkya Rahane and Ishan Sharma—the wedding seemed like a low-key affair.

She posted a heartfelt message on her Instagram 
A little more than a year ago, Deepika Padukone confessed on national television that she struggled with depression. Since then she has launched her Live Love Laugh Foundation, which aims to help people fight depression. Last night, Alia Bhatt's older sister, Shaheen Bhatt opened up about depression to her Instagram followers. The twenty-seven-year-old spoke of how she has lived with the condition through her teenage years and urged more people to come forward with their own experiences. Read her moving Instagram post below: 
"I've lived with depression on and off since I was about 13 years old. This is not a revelation or a confession. Those who know me know this about me. It's not something I take any pains to hide, I'm not ashamed of it or particularly troubled by it. It's just a part of who I am. I have days where I feel good and then I have days where I don't. One minute everything's fine and the next it's like someone turned the light off inside my head. I go quiet and it's difficult to get out of bed. Like it always does the world around me loses focus and I struggle to make sense of it. Sometimes these bouts last an hour - sometimes they last days. 
Today, I'm on day 4. I say I live with depression rather than I struggle with it because for me (and I speak only for myself here) I don't see why it has to be a struggle. 
I once read an idea by an American essayist called Richard Mitchell which stayed with me; it's now become how I try to approach the dips in my week or month. The idea is this: 
To be sick, or to suffer, is inevitable. But to become bitter and vindictive in sickness and suffering and to surrender to irrationality, supposing yourself the innocent and virtuous victim of the evils intentions of the world, is not inevitable. 
The appropriate answer to the question - Why me? is the other question - Why not me? 
Why am I writing about this? 
Well, I spend a fair amount of time on social media during the course of my day and today I found myself looking for something to post because it's been a few days since I've posted anything. 
I couldn't find anything so I figured I'd just talk about this - how I'm doing, instead of what I'm doing. 
It's as simple as that, and we could all stand to do a little more of it. 
P.S. That picture just seemed to work in this context." 
The post has already received a lot of support and appreciation from Bhatt's followers. Our hearts go out to Bhatt and we hope she continues to help people embrace mental illness.

Enroll at ‘Finance Gym’ 
Demonitisation is happening, whether we like it or not. The naysayers can cry themselves hoarse about the impracticality of it all in our cash-driven country of over a billion people, but it's happening and as we speak, well underway since it was announced over a week ago. Among those hit include homemakers who've ‘secretly' saved for the rainy day. And, while there are many lessons to be learnt from this ‘surgical' strike by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if there's one that stands out the most is the need to make the shift from ‘saving to investing'. Women, especially, need to understand the importance of investing early on. 
Here's where Finance GYM (Grow Your Money) For Women by Binal Gandhi's Mumbai-based The Learning Curve Academy can help.  “Studies show women make better long-term investors than men, once they start investing. The idea behind these workshops is to empower women with the right know-how on investments,” says Gandhi, who has worked for over 20 years in the areas of corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions. 
Highlights of the five-hour long masterclass include topics that vary from the pros and cons of investing in gold and shares to in depth information on mutual funds, SIPs (Systematic Investment Plan), insurance and tax exemptions. “Anything to do with finance can be quite intimidating, which is why we've tried to make it as simple and interesting as possible with interactive games like finance taboo, myth vs reality as well an online simulation game with real investment products… they basically get to apply the concepts they've learnt here,” explains Gandhi.

Convinced to book your tickets yet? 
Just days before Alia Bhatt and Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dear Zindagi hits theatres, Bollywood got a first look at the film with a special preview this week. 
While the trailers have already generated lots of excitement from fans, nothing can prepare you for the overwhelming support and love the Dear Zindagi crew has received online from the stars who watched the film. While Shanoo Sharma and Shaheen Abbas were full of praise for director Gauri Shinde, Mini Mathur and Sophie Choudry found themselves falling in love with Shah Rukh Khan all over again. Both Sushant Singh Rajput and Atul Kasbekar couldn't believe the level of Alia Bhatt's performance, and Maria Goretti gushed over Kunal Kapoor's role. 
If you weren't convinced to watch it yet, these tweets should do the trick. See you at the movies on November 25!

How pilot Gul Panag is inspiring women all over India 
Gul Panag has always been a bit of a Bollywood badass. She's broken stereotypes with films like Turning 30, she showed up at her wedding on a bike, and this week, the model-actor-entrepreneur scored herself the title of a pilot. “I'm super excited,” she gushes to us. “It's a big, big, big life moment!” 
Not surprisingly, the internet has blown up over the news (“I was trending on Twitter!”) and congratulations have been pouring in ever since the star made her announcement. “All the guys have responded to this saying, ‘Oh my God, you're so cool',” Panag laughs. “But the girls' responses are the most touching. I've got messages saying ‘You've proved to us that there are no limits for women' and ‘Whenever we think we can't do something, we think of you and you inspire us to chase our dreams. You show us that age, or being married, should not come in the way of doing what you want with your life.' Typically in India, you think once you're married your priorities shift, and of course they do, but that doesn't mean you have to stop chasing your dreams. It's very humbling to hear that something you're doing which is so personal—for me it was a bucket list item—could inspire so many people. I completely underestimated the impact it would have on fellow women.” 
So how did the journey towards becoming a pilot begin for Panag? “This was something I've wanted to do for the last seven-eight years,” she says. “Aviation is a passion, and a pure hobby. And so my husband said to me, ‘What's stopping you?' I said my schedule has to be managed, my companies were in critical phases, and he said, ‘Look, if you want to do something, there's no point talking about it. Take your dream and convert it into a goal. Go pursue it.' So I found a school in India that has a dedicated PPL programme (Private Pilot License); it's called Chimes Aviation Academy. We checked it out and we were super impressed. So I enrolled, I finished-two thirds of my flying, completed my exams, and I went back once the monsoon ended (PPL pilots can't fly in the monsoon) to complete the rest of my flying. I finished my last and final check ride on the plane on Monday. I came back yesterday.” 
“It's incredible that I had this privilege and the good fortune of having a husband who's as rock solid as he is,” Panag continues. “Right now we're in the middle of putting together India's first ever women's festival, called Festivelle. I was missing in action for 10 days while completing my course's last leg, and he completely filled in for me. He's always supporting me in whatever it is I want to do. When I mention something, an average person may say ‘Why?' but he says, ‘Why not?'” 
As for Panag's future plans, the sky is the limit: “The next goal is to get my night rating, and slowly my instrument rating too. Right now, I'm rated to fly VFR (Visual Flight Rules) only. My next agenda is to keep building on this and pursuing this hobby. Also through this course I met so many like-minded people. We're planning on getting together, pooling in and buying a plane! The same plane I learned to fly in.”

U-turn central 
We're all having a busy week, not the least because of the man who spewed too much. As the president-elect of the United States of America starts assembling his White House staff—Reince Priebus and Stephen Bannon being the most significant appointees so far—and placards of “Not My President” dot the streets, we've also witnessed some magnificent U-turns. In a rather introspective statement on the nature of public discourse on CBS's 60 Minutes with host Lesley Stahl, Trump said, “Sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated,” he said. “I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character.” While time shall attest to the distance (or the lack thereof) between rhetoric and true intent, here are some of his about-turns (Hillary Clinton has already gone from “nasty woman” to “very strong and very smart” and Barack Obama is a “good man” for whom he has “great respect”). 
On Obamacare When Stahl asked him about the healthcare legislations he plans to introduce in place of Obamacare, which during his campaign speeches he sought to repeal completely, he answered, “I'm going to ensure that people with pre-conditions are going to be covered, one that allows young people to remain on their parents' plans until the age of 26, because it's one of the strongest assets… It adds cost but it's going to be very much something that we're going to keep.” (Both provisions are part of his predecessor's law.) 
The Wall Instead of the Wall on the Mexican border, he told Stahl there “could be fencing in certain areas.” On the issue of illegal immigrants, he added, “After the border is secure and after everything gets normalised, we're going to make a determination on the people that they're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that,” he said. He now wants to deport the two to three million immigrants he characterised as dangerous as opposed to the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants that he promised to throw out earlier. 
The N-word In March this year, in an interview with Maggie Haberman and David E Sanger of the New York Times, to a question on the threat that North Korea's nuclear arsenal posed to its neighbours, he said that regional dynamics necessitate that the allies of the United States have their own nuclear deterrent. “And, would I rather have North Korea have them (nuclear weapons) with Japan sitting there having them also?... You may very well be better off if that's the case,” the Times had quoted him as saying. 
In a recent Twitter post two days ago, though, Trump retorted, “The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ‘more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.' How dishonest are they. I never said this!” 
On same-sex marriages While the spectre of Mike Pence has been a worrying aspect for the LGBT community, Trump said he was “fine” with last year's Supreme Court decision validating same-sex marriages.

The internet is playing its Trump cards 
The Interweb is a glorious place – it holds remedies for illnesses, tips for break-ups and hook-ups, and lots more. What's happening in the United States of America currently feels like a combination of all of the above – a union that no one can understand, no explanation for how it came to be, a break-up (with Obama) and an infernal disease that we can't seem to find a vaccine for. But the truth is President-elect Donald Trump is here, and he's here to stay. Applying balm to these fresh wounds are memes – celebrating Joe Biden and Barack Obama, ruing Mr Trump and lightening the mood with laughs, using images from the Obamas' and Trumps' White House meet and more. We round-up our favourite Biden-Obama memes – here's to the power of comic relief.

This year's equivalent to Dubsmash and Ice Bucket challenges is the Mannequin Challenge. Straight out of a whacked out scene from a wax museum, the challenge demands the actors to hold their pose while someone shoots the video while recreating an iconic moment—props for humour and holding your breath the longest. As you and your squad work on one, these are five of the coolest Mannequin Challenges we have seen so far that set the mark pretty high.

Our November cover star’s next big leap 
Pictures of her filming with director Majidi in Dhobi Ghat, Mumbai recently hit social media: 
Untagged- Deepika Padukone was seen shooting with Iranian filmmaker- Majid Majidi in Dhobi Ghat last week. #SecretProject pic.twitter.com/tsp7todLVD

The Indian story and will be shot in Mumbai, Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and Kashmir. 
Majidi has given us heartwarming cinematic gems such as Baran and Children of Heaven, the latter was nominated to receive the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His last film Muhammad: The Messenger of God depicts the life of Prophet Muhammad with historical and factual accuracy. 
In xXx, Padukone plays a fierce huntress named Serena Unger. Things couldn't be farther in Majidi's yet untitled production, for which she was seen shooting in a threadbare red and green salwar-kameez, possibly playing a washer woman. 
We can't wait to see Padukone emote on screen in the hands of Majidi.

These may be Parineeti Chopra’s most stunning pictures on the internet 
Bubbly, fierce, and always funny, Parineeti Chopra is definitely on top of Bollywood's must-watch list. That's precisely why the star scored herself a spot in Vogue India's November 2013 cover dedicated to the film industry's fabulous fresh faces, and then found herself on her very first solo cover with us later in February 2014. 
What makes Chopra such a special star is her ability to portray any personality, from aggressive to playful. While on one hand she played eccentric runaway in Hasee Toh Phasee, she brought out her inner fighter for Ishaqzaade alongside Arjun Kapoor, and then effortlessly channeled her feminine avatar in Kill/Dil. Scroll through her best Vogue shoot moments and you'll notice her do the same in our pages. Whether she's playing tug of war with Ayushmann Khurana, smouldering straight into the camera, or playing pretty girl in pink, Chopra never disappoints.

The sweetest pictures from Bipasha Basu’s first Karva Chauth 
Ever since Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover tied the knot this April, the duo have become one of Bollywood's most-loved couples. 
October 19 marked the Grovers' very first Karva Chauth, and Bipasha made sure to share her experience of the festival, from the puja to her latest couple selfie, with all her fans on Instagram. The most fun post of them all: a Boomerang of the star jumping in her pink and white salwar kameez captioned “Hungry Me=Crazy Me”. Catch the highlights of her first Karva Chauth in our slideshow.

Vogue India October 2015 cover shoot 
It was when Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh began working together on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon ki Rasleela Ram-Leela that rumours of the stars' new romance first hit the news. 
Since then, the duo have been spotted together multiple times, stirring up rumours of family vacations together, and an upcoming wedding. 
But it seems that the Padukone-Singh story might have run its course, with fresh news on their break-up taking over the internet. While some say this may be due to Padukone's quote in an interview last month stating she was neither engaged nor ready to be married, others think Singh hinted at the split by mentioning that his fans were wrong to assume he was dating anyone currently at the trailer launch of Befikre. Either way, #DeepVeer fans (us included) hope this is just another case of rumour mills working overtime.

Amul ads archive 
It's impossible to tell by looking at her, but the Amul Girl turned 50 this month. For half a century, the blue-haired, wide-eyed, polka-dot-clad kid has had her finger on the country's pulse, doling out sharp commentaries; the sting eased by her innocence and generous helpings of buttered puns. 
Created by adman Sylvester daCunha with the help of illustrators Eustace Fernandes and Usha Katrak in 1966, the campaign, now run by son Rahul daCunha, is probably one of the longest running ones in the world with a single mascot, while her contemporaries, like the Air India Maharaja, quietly slunk back into the shadows. Always current, often goofy, sometimes controversial, the Amul Girl has through her trademark wit issued satirical polemics (on the compulsory sterilisation policy during the Emergency), riffed lightheartedly on popular culture (Koffee with Karan, Casino Royale, even Katrina Kaif's ‘Sheila ki Jawani'), and delivered powerful messages against racism and sexism. 
From long before the phrase came to be, the Amul Girl has been undeniably “on point”. To celebrate her legacy, here's a look at 50 of her witticisms from the campaign.

The movie’s first look is now out 
Dear Zindagi 🌴 
A photo posted by Alia ✨⭐️ (@aliaabhatt) on Oct 18, 2016 at 6:00am PDT 
If you watched Sridevi-starrer English Vinglish back in 2012, you'll agree that Gauri Shinde, the woman behind the film, is one to watch out for. The director is now all set to launch her second Bollywood project, and by the looks of it, this one is going to be a memorable movie as well. 
Released on Alia Bhatt's Instagram page last evening, the first look of Dear Zindagi features the star riding a bicycle down a scenic road with co-star (and Bollywood icon) Shah Rukh Khan. 
While Bhatt has shared glimpses of the film on her page before (some with a Prisma filter on them for added mystery), her latest post is the very first official poster. You won't have to wait long to watch this one. The film releases on November 25!

She was reportedly suffering from chronic lung disease 
Parmeshwar Godrej, noted philanthropist and a celebrated face on Mumbai's social circuit, passed away on Monday evening of a chronic lung disease at Breach Candy hospital, Mumbai, reports say. 
Godrej started her career as one of the first air hostesses at Air India, known to be a glamorous profession then (Maureen Wadia, another veteran on Mumbai's who's-who list, was also previously an Air India flight attendant). Apart from being known for her legendary parties—having hosted everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Liz Hurley at her Juhu residence—she was also involved in a number of charitable initiatives. Most notable amongst these was the Heroes Project, started by her in 2004 with Hollywood actor Richard Gere, which aimed at mobilising action to help eradicate HIV/AIDS in India. She was also consulted by Harvard School of Public Health for their projects in India. 
"Parmeshwar and I worked on her charity, The Heroes Project. Her voltage of glamour, intelligence, and storytelling was unmatched. She was committed to the cause of raising awareness about HIV in India; in particular, she was concerned for the stigma associated with HIV and how women suffered for this. She was entirely committed, hands on, and generous. Personally, she was an excellent, thoughtful friend and her great, enduring pride and joy were her children," says Siddharth Shanghvi, who was a friend. 
"It gives me tremendous emotional satisfaction to be able to bring about positive changes in the lives of others. In addition, when one is fortunate enough to be in a position to help others, I believe it is a responsibility to do so," she said in She Walks, She Leads, which features Godrej among 24 highly successful, inspirational Indian women. 
Many friends took to Twitter to express their condolences to husband, Adi Godrej (chairman of the Godrej Group) and children Nisa and Pirojsha Godrej, and Tanya Dubash. 
Few friends would go to the ends of the earth for you in times of need #ParmeshwarGodrej was one of them. RIP. Cherished friendships

The model of the moment 
At a towering 5'9”, 25 year-old Radhika Nair is India's latest offering to the international fashion industry this season. The model walked for Balenciaga's spring/summer 2016 showcase—one of the most talked-about shows since creative director Demna Gvasalia's takeover at the decorated French luxury house. Vogue spoke to Radhika Nair about her breakthrough moment and here is what you need to know about the rising star:

Get to know the real Radhika Nair 
• A part of the castings for the Balenciaga show took place in Delhi. Stylist Nikhil D was helping casting director Henry Mackintosh Thomas of Arqa to scout girls in India and Radhika Nair was chosen from the lot. 
• Nair walked all of one show this season. “I was an exclusive for Balenciaga,” she says. 
• The model describes the atmosphere backstage at Balenciaga as warm and calm. Demna Gvasalia and stylist Lotta Volkova were there throughout, working on last-minute fittings. 
• She doesn't make big bones about her success. “I'm not so emotional about it. It's something that I hoped would naturally happen in my career and I am glad I did. I am enjoying the moment and I do feel good. Of course, I know it is a big deal,” she adds. 
• Contrary to popular belief, Radhika Nair is not a budding photographer. She looks up to the works of Martin Parr, Pieter Hugo and Bharat Sikka to name a few. “I don't know anything about lighting or framing. I haven't used many cameras but I do love my point and shoot and it does a good job,” says Nair. 
• Nair is new to yoga (she started practicing two weeks ago) and actively listens to hip-hop, future soul and alternative rock. 
• She was born Malayali, raised in Jharkhand and now shuttles between Mumbai and Paris. She refuses to reveal the extended form of the abbreviation ‘b.y.s.o.d', her account name on Instagram.

Gloria be! 
Here's a history lesson. More than 40 years ago, before Gloria Steinem helped launch what would be known as the women's liberation movement, “help-wanted” ads in American newspapers were separated into jobs for men (budding executives) and women (secretaries). Steinem's unrelenting crusade for equal pay, equal rights and reproductive freedom gave women their greatest modern leader. Before she made history, Steinem was a New York freelancer, writing about everything from mod hair- cuts to social policy. Glimpses of feminism were seen in pieces she did for Glamour, like ‘The Student Princess (or How to Seize Power on the Campus of Your Choice)'. Her then roommate, actor Ali MacGraw, remembers Steinem “working, working at her desk in the corner—I knew she was destined for great significance. She was a beautiful creature with so much substance.” 
The moment that changed her life came when she was covering a legislative hearing on abortion in 1969, when the procedure was still banned in most states. “How much power could we ever have if we had no power over our own bodies?” she wrote. By 1971, she had co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus, helped launch Ms. magazine and made Newsweek's cover as the “best fundraiser” and “most sought- after spokesperson” of the burgeoning women's movement. As her fame grew, her one-liners became legend: “The truth will set you free,” she said, “but first it will piss you off.” 
Steinem has been a leader on everything from gay rights to sexual harassment. At 82, she's still influencing young women the world over— her panel discussions drew the most packed house even at Jaipur Literature Festival this year. Although she believes there's still work to be done, she's thrilled by the progress so far. “Young women today are more shit-free than we were, much more likely to say what they think,” she says. As for her own life, her famous quotes could sum that up: “We are the women that our parents warned us about, and we are proud.” —Sheila Weller 
Steinem talks about the surprise success of Ms. magazine (which she co-founded) and the most inspiring women today. Edited excerpts: 
Do you find it scary when you hear people talking about how women shouldn't have equal pay or abortion rights? Do you wonder what they're thinking? I know what they're thinking. Their worldview is the opposite [of mine]. They're saying that the means of reproduction, which is women's bodies, has to be controlled... I understand what they're saying. It's wrong, but I understand it. 
How important was it for you to speak out when you first started doing so? It was like being born. You're like, “Oh, I'm not crazy! The system is crazy. Imagine that?” It was a force of understanding and self-respect. You start to understand why things happen and it's the big, “Aha!” But, the public speaking part of it was very hard for me. 
Did it get any easier? It's sort of like malaria. I'm grateful that I can do it because it is a different form of communication from writing, and you do have all five senses when you're in a room together. All those chemicals that create empathy only work when you are in a room together. I'm really grateful to have this experience in my life, of being in a room with people, talking, learning and hearing what they have to say. I'm grateful because speaking in public is not my natural form of communication. We choose to be writers be- cause we don't want to talk. 
Once you get past the nerves about speaking in front of an audience, does it feel empowering to get feedback? It's like being part of a big campfire. It's very moving and satisfying. I've learned that audiences that seem impersonal eventually come up with such intimate, wise and totally surprising things. It's empowering, in the sense of feeling like you're a part of something important. 
When you started Ms. magazine in 1971, you had no idea how it would be received. What was the most validating response? Well, the first response was when we printed 3,00,000 copies of the preview issue, and we couldn't afford publicity. I was on a morning show, and people were calling up after the morning show saying, “We can't find it.” It was about a week of having it on the newsstands. We put it out in January and it was called the Spring Issue because we thought it was going to stay there and we didn't want to embarrass the Steinem (left) with actor Cybill Shepherd, c. 1969 movement, but it sold out. That told me that we had created something that was needed and wanted. Other than that, it was the letters. We were a tiny magazine, compared to most other magazines, but we got more letters than any of them. The early letters are now at Radcliffe and Smith (in Massachusetts) as a record of the movement. 
How do you see the portrayal of women on television today? The worst of it are those Real Housewives shows. A friend is writing a book on female friendship, and she's doing a last chapter on the Housewives shows, which I think are a backlash against women bonding with each other be- cause all they show is hostility, competition and derived power, as wives of men with power. 
Is there anyone today who you think is particularly empowering? In the US, the most obvious ones are in politics. There's Hillary Clinton or Kirsten Gillibrand, who's my Senator from the state of New York, or Maxine Waters in California. 
Where do you see women now in the bigger picture? There's much more support, much less hostility. The greatest problem today is the effort to make this change seem permanent. As with the Suffragist movement, which lasted 100 years, movements have to last a century, so we have at least another 50 years to go. About 10 years into the movement, people began to say, “Oh, that used to be necessary, but it's not anymore,” and they're still saying that. That's the forum the polite opposition takes. The not-so-polite opposition is different.

We bet you can relate to this 
The response to the path-breaking film Pink has been tremendous. It was only natural for Vogue to continue the conversation that the film started. 
We caught up with leading ladies Taapsee Paanu, Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang about the challenges they have faced as women in India and why the colour pink holds a special meaning to each of them. Watch the video here.

We break it down for you 
Prep your skin: Ok, we cannot say this enough—hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Your skin has to be nourished and supple if you want your make-up to look flawless. Try Artistry Youth Xtend Enriching Lotion. The nourishing formula sinks in quickly and prepares your skin for the make-up ahead. 
Even out your complexion: Foundation is your friend when it matches your skin tone perfectly. Use your fingers or go at it with a dense brush for an even, seamless application: we recommend Maybelline New York FitMe Foundation. 
Make those brows bold: Priyanka's statement brows anchor this minimal make-up look. If you have full brows, then a brow gel—we love HD Brows Lash and Brow Booster—is all you need to set them in place. But if your brows are sparse, draw light, feather-like strokes on your brow with a waxy crayon like Inglot Brow Shaping Pencil in a dark brown shade (black pigment is too stark). Blend in the colour well with a spoolie brush and swipe on the gel to set. 
Define your eyes: Priyanka's soft bronze shadow adds the necessary depth to eyes (leaving them bare with a bold brow is never a good idea). We recommend a cream shadow that you can layer; blend Chambor Orosa Sculpting Eye Shadow in Honey Gold across your upper lid with your finger. To enhance your eye shape, use a precision liquid liner like Lakmé Absolute Gloss Artist. Finish with multiple coats of mascara on your upper lashes (we like Rimmel Scandal Eyes Retro Glam Mascara) and a single coat on your lower lashes. 
Add a touch of blush: Bring warmth to your face with Revlon Powder Blush in Naughty Nude. This matte powder (it doubles up as a bronzer minus the sheen) adds a deeper tone to your skin and subtly brings out your cheekbones. 
Swipe on a plum lip: Not as goth as berry or wine nor as classic as red, plum is the perfect understated bold shade for an evening out. While Priyanka's make-up artist layered two lip colours to get this shade, we found the perfect match—L'Oréal Paris Color Riche Moist Matte in Sheer Plum. Gently exfoliate your lips to rid them of dry skin and swipe on one coat of colour. Blot with a tissue and layer to deepen the shade. 
Bring on the shine: Create a sharp centre part in your hair and secure at the nape of your neck in a ponytail. Spritz on TIGI S-Factor Flat Iron Shine Spray and flat-iron the ponytail till its poker straight. Take out a small section of hair and wrap it around the hair tie, securing the ends under the tail. Warm a few drops of Toni & Guy Glamour Serum in your palms and lightly run them over the hair at your crown.

And all the other fun you missed from the 88th Academy Awards 
As far as award shows go, the Oscars are the biggest deal. The results of months of careful elimination are sealed in small envelopes that could change the lives of the winners forever. The 88th Academy Awards were the cause of much excitement, not only because Priyanka Chopra was presenting for the first time (the second Indian in history to do so), but also because Leonardo DiCaprio finally, finally won an Oscar. 
Although the poised red carpet pictures may make you think the black-tie affair was all seriousness and no fun, these Instagrams will prove you wrong. Take a look through our slideshow to see the stars get candid at the Oscars

How to make casual look glamorous 
At the 88th Academy Awards red carpet, if there was one element that stood out where the hair was involved, it was how sophistication was infused in playful dos. 
Whether it was Brie Larson taking the otherwise casual ‘hun' to the red carpet in a very polished way, or Lady Gaga giving her vintage waves a big bouncy upgrade—it was clear they weren't intending to keep it conventionally ordinary. 
Talking about unconventional, Rooney Mara gave us serious future goals for topknots, with her sci-fi inspired severe triple-bun updo, for when you feel the need to break the monotony and ignore conformities. And for when you need some romanticism in your life, try Olivia Wilde's all-over braided updo that she paired with soft, shimmery eyes. 
There was also Jennifer Lawrence's uneven sleek bob, Charlize Theron's powerful finger curls, and Sofia Vergara's curly ponytail tied at the nape—looks that are as easy as they are high-glam for some evening inspiration. 
Then of course, Margot Robbie and Priyanka Chopra were reminders that sometimes you don't need to try too hard: the former in soft, easy waves and Chopra keeping it elegantly simple in a low-slung sleek ponytail.

The best beauty moments at the Oscars 2016 
As the world got ready to celebrate Hollywood's biggest awards night, the stars put their best foot (and faces) forward on the red carpet. The beauty game was strong, as always, this time maintaining classic Hollywood glam but with a hint of stark edge. 
Like when Lady Gaga went the glitter route with her rose gold eyes and Olivia Wilde sprinkled stardust shimmer on her lids, both pairing it with glossy nude lips. Or when Jennifer Lawrence rimmed her eyes with black kohl to break the softness of her muted make-up; and when Rooney Mara gave us so much more to talk about: those straight up sharp brows hooding a teal smoky eye, paired with lustrous deep red lips. 
Then there was the ultimate bold lip—a beautiful toned-down berry on homegirl Priyanka Chopra, a glossy coral on Reese Witherspoon and a deep pink on Brie Larson. 
Flip through the slideshow to see how everyone did in the beauty department on the red carpet at the Oscars 2016.

Fine words said by the king of the world 
He finally did it—Leonardo DiCaprio took home Oscar gold. Though the acceptance speeches during the 88th annual ceremony in LA on February 28 were less than remarkable, DiCaprio said some lovely words after his win. 
Read the full transcript, below. 
Thank you all so very much. Thank you to the Academy, thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year. 'The Revenant' was the product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew. First off, to my brother in this endeavour, Mr Tom Hardy. Tom, your talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen… thank you for creating a transcendent cinematic experience. 
Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency…my entire team. I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career… To my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly, you know who you are. 
And lastly I just want to say this: Making The Revenant was about man's relationship to the natural world. A world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. 
Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our children's children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. 
I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted. Thank you so very much.

Priyanka Chopra’s Oscar red carpet moment 
This year Bollywood lovers, and Quantico and Baywatch enthusiasts around the world kept up with the 88th Academy Awards live telecast to see Priyanka Chopra's first ever walk on the Oscar red carpet. And the actor delivered, in a stunning, sheer white embellished strapless gown by Zuhair Murad. 
Charlize Theron set the bar high for the next person sporting red to the event. In a form hugging Dior Haute Couture gown, the actor made for a statuesque appearance that is hard to replicate. Kate Winslet chose a liquid metallic Ralph Lauren gown and Nirav Modi jewellery. Alicia Vikander wore a daisy yellow custom Louis Vuitton dress with a bubble hem. Notable in Armani Privé were Cate Blanchett and Naomi Watts. 
Rooney Mara once again favoured Givenchy, while Julianne Moore went with Chanel. Saoirse Ronan picked a custom-made green sequinned Calvin Klein to represent Ireland. Brie Larson went with a floaty Gucci dress, while Chrissy Tiegen showed off her pregnancy glow and baby bump in a beaded Marchesa sheath.

A quick chat with the sassy star 
Let's be honest; Priyanka Chopra's life is what dreams are made of. Her gamut of achievements is only but the beginning of her strong global presence. To review her ever-increasing list of accomplishments: after successfully collecting a loyal fan following of millions across the world for her role as Alex Parrish in the ABC drama Quantico, 2016 began for the 33-year-old actress with a People's Choice Award win for ‘Favourite Actress In A New TV Series'. This was followed by a Padma Shri award, India's fourth highest civilian honour, and then she topped it all with her stellar performance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's epic drama Bajirao Mastani. Let's not also forget, the internet-breaking news of the star joining the Baywatch cast in the upcoming movie, starring opposite Dwayne ‘The Rock' Johnson. That's some serious #FOMO-inducing news. 
Continuing this successful stint, Chopra will now present an award at the 88th Academy Awards this Sunday (early Monday morning for Indian viewers). This sure hits a big high for Bollywood as an industry, Chopra being only the second Indian to be a presenter at the prestigious Hollywood awards (Star Trek's Persis Khambatta was the first one, in 1980). 
What's going on in her mind right now? Chopra shares what she's most looking forward to at the Oscars: 
On her favourite Oscar nominees: “There were so many great films this year! Some of my favourites were Spotlight, Room, The Danish Girl.” 
On the one thing she can't wait for: “Of course, like everyone else, I want to see if Leo [DiCaprio] will win his first Oscar.” 
On her plus one for the event: “I'll be taking my manager.” 
On her post-Oscars party plans: “I'm supposed to be hopping between a few parties but I'm getting on a red-eye to Miami that night because I start shooting for Baywatch on Monday. It's pretty nuts.” 
Here's looking at some of Chopra's best red carpet moments internationally:

And here’s what we’d dress her in 
She bagged her People's Choice Award last month in a shimmering Vera Wang, she sauntered down the Screen Actors Guild Awards red carpet this weekend in a romantic pink Monique Lhuillier, and now, Priyanka Chopra is all set to take the stage in LA at the Oscars. 
Having carved a niche for herself in American showbiz over months of Quantico shoots and music recordings, the star will now be presenting at the upcoming Academy Awards, as announced by the event's official Twitter account. 
Big #Oscars news! Thirteen more presenters announced! https://t.co/ACwuPaPCPP pic.twitter.com/pUCmgjUhXR 
— The Academy (@TheAcademy) February 1, 2016 
“These artists have enriched the international moviegoing experience with a range of memorable work from the comic to the profound,” said Oscar producers Reginald Hudlin and David Hill. “In the process, they have won over millions of fans, and we count ourselves among them.” 
Hosted by Chris Rock, the 88th Academy Awards will take place on Sunday, February 28. And while we wait for Chopra's next big Hollywood moment, here are some gowns we think her envy-worthy body would carry off flawlessly. There's no doubt she could pull off a barely-there Versace gown with as much ease as a regal Manish Malhotra, or even that super sexy Sabyasachi three-piece.

Here's the Who Wore What: jewellery edition 
The Oscars trophies maybe under lock and key in LA mansions but the world is yet to recover from the impressive display of finery. It's safe to say that Hollywood shies away from highly inflammable hairdos and clunky accessories but who can resist the quiet glimmer of fine diamonds? To take a leaf from the their page, accentuate your look with just one strong element. 
For shorter hair lengths: opt for long earrings or go risque with a earrcuff. 
For dresses that flaunt your décolletage: Go for a strong necklace in contrast tones. 
To add some balance to either looks, add a cuff and you are perfect for a long night of posing before the cameras.
